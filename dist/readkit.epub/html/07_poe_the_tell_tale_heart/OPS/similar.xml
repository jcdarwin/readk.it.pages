Raven</em></a>
<p>"The Raven" is a narrative poem by the American writer and poet
Edgar Allan Poe. It was published for the first time on January 29,
1845, in the New York Evening Mirror. Noted for its musicality,
stylized language and supernatural atmosphere, it tells of the
mysterious visit of a talking raven to a distraught lover, tracing
his slow descent into madness.</p>

and the Pendulum</em></a>
<p>"The Pit and the Pendulum" is a short story written by Edgar
Allan Poe and first published in 1842. The story is about the
torments endured by a prisoner of the Spanish Inquisition, though
Poe skews historical facts. The narrator of the story is deemed
guilty for an unnamed crime and put into a completely dark room. He
passes out while trying to determine the size of the room. When he
wakes up, he realizes there is a large, deep pit in the middle of
the room. He loses consciousness again and awakens strapped on his
back, unable to move more than his head. He soon realizes there is
a large blade-like pendulum hanging above him, slowly getting
closer to cutting through his chest. He finds a way to escape but
the walls of his prison start to move and close in on him, pushing
him closer and closer to falling into the pit.<br />
The story is especially effective at inspiring fear in the reader
because of its heavy focus on the senses, such as sound,
emphasizing its reality, unlike many of Poe's stories which are
aided by the supernatural. The traditional elements established in
popular horror tales at the time are followed but critical
reception has been mixed.</p>

Murders in the Rue Morgue</em></a>
<p>"The Murders in the Rue Morgue" is a short story by Edgar Allan
Poe published in Graham's Magazine in 1841. It has been claimed as
the first detective story; Poe referred to it as one of his "tales
of ratiocination". Similar works predate Poe's stories, including
Das Fräulein von Scuderi (1819) by E.T.A. Hoffmann and Zadig (1748)
by Voltaire.<br />
C. Auguste Dupin is a man in Paris who solves the mysterious brutal
murder of two women. Numerous witnesses heard a suspect, though no
one agrees on what language was spoken. At the murder scene, Dupin
finds a hair that does not appear to be human.<br />
As the first true detective in fiction, the Dupin character
established many literary devices which would be used in future
fictional detectives including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot.
Many later characters, for example, follow Poe's model of the
brilliant detective, his personal friend who serves as narrator,
and the final revelation being presented before the reasoning that
leads up to it. Dupin himself reappears in "The Mystery of Marie
Roget" and "The Purloined Letter".</p>

Masque of the Red Death</em></a>
<p>"The Masque of the Red Death", originally published as "The Mask
of the Red Death", is a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe and
first published in 1842. The story follows Prince Prospero's
attempts to avoid a dangerous plague known as the Red Death by
hiding in his abbey. He, along with many other wealthy nobles, has
a masquerade ball within seven rooms of his abbey, each decorated
with a different color. In the midst of their revelry, a mysterious
figure enters and makes his way through each of the rooms. When
Prospero confronts this stranger, he falls dead. The story follows
many traditions of Gothic fiction and is often analyzed as an
allegory about the inevitability of death, though some critics
advise against an allegorical reading. Many different
interpretations have been presented, as well as attempts to
identify the true nature of the disease of the "Red Death."</p>

Cask of Amontillado</em></a>
<p>"The Cask of Amontillado" (sometimes spelled "The Casque of
Amontillado") is a short story, written by Edgar Allan Poe and
first published in the November 1846 issue of Godey's Lady's
Book.<br />
The story is set in a nameless Italian city in an unspecified year
(possibly sometime during the eighteenth century) and concerns the
deadly revenge taken by the narrator on a friend who he claims has
insulted him. Like several of Poe's stories, and in keeping with
the 19th-century fascination with the subject, the narrative
revolves around a person being buried alive – in this case, by
immurement.</p>

<p>"The Black Cat" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was
first published in the August 19, 1843, edition of The Saturday
Evening Post. It is a study of the psychology of guilt, often
paired in analysis with Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart". In both, a
murderer carefully conceals his crime and believes himself
unassailable, but eventually breaks down and reveals himself,
impelled by a nagging reminder of his guilt.</p>
