  <p class="heading">To start with</p>

  <p class="first-paras"><span class="italic">I’m three, and I’m sitting in the sun on the grass beside the narrow strip of garden in our long skinny backyard. Before Mum sees me I reach out for a handful of rich dark soil and fill my mouth with its crunchy, crumbly, satisfying warmth.</span></p>

  <p><span class="italic">Now I’m four, watching Mum as she cuts a neat square plug out of an apple. She hides sugar in the hole for me to find and puts back the plug, the cut-lines invisible in the green skin.</span></p>

  <p class="first-paras">When I think about my childhood it’s the food I remember most. Apart from that delicious dirt, what I ate was just the standard fare of thousands of 1950s’ New Zealand homes, yet I knew how much it mattered. Even more than the Everglaze summer dresses and knitted winter jumpers with matching skirts, food meant pleasure, love and safety. But it could also tip over into revulsion, rejection and danger.</p>

  <p>The memories of food go far beyond childhood. Since the day I left home to get married at the age of nineteen, what I have eaten and cooked, and what has been cooked for me, have often seemed to hold the essence of who I thought I was or wanted to be, and how I lived with the people I loved. Food has also been a creative challenge and a daily source of sensual delight.</p>

  <p>I haven’t tried to cover every aspect of my food experiences over the last sixty years. Instead I have lifted out what seem to me the most interesting and intensely flavoured morsels in the whole complex, many-layered casserole as it has slow-cooked its way through my life. There’s a strong emphasis on eating and cooking at home, where food and feelings are always so deeply blended – but home has moved from Auckland to Albania to London to Wellington, with side trips into French territory, real and imagined.</p>

  <p>The book doesn’t conform strictly to the passing of time. It moves backwards and forwards through the years, so the people I’ve shared my life with appear at various intervals. For example, Harvey McQueen, my second husband, turns up well before I write about meeting him in 1979.</p>

  <p>It’s never easy to turn and look intently into your past, then try to bring back what you find there. I hope these ten portions of my life, closely connected but each with its own distinctive character, will be as satisfying for you to read as cooking them up has been for me.</p>
