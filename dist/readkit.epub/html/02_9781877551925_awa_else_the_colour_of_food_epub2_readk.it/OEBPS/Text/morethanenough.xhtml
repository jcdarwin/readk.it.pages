  More than enough</p>

  <p class="first-paras"><span class="italic">It’s school holidays and I’ve spent the morning with Mum while she gets on with the breakfast dishes and the downstairs cleaning, listening to Aunt Daisy, Doctor Paul and Portia Faces Life on the radio, while my little sister plays in the backyard. Just before lunchtime Mum gives me three shillings and I run up the lane and around the corner to Davenport’s Bakery for three ninepenny meat pies, hot from the oven. We eat them with soft white bread and butter, and tomato sauce from the red plastic tomato. With only the three of us, there’s no need to hurry: Dad won’t be home needing his dinner until half past five, and for the time being Mum seems to be on holiday too.</span></p>

  <p class="first-paras">It took me years to recognise that it was my mother who sowed the seeds of the pleasure I get from food. She got profound satisfaction from producing a constant generous supply of meals for herself, her husband and her children. When she was a child, that reliable security had been mostly missing. Many of the stories she told me turned on how hard it had been for her mother, Harriet, to produce any kind of food at all. The stories were like a real-life version of my copy of <span class="italic">Grimm’s Fairy Tales</span>, an old small-print edition of a scary nineteenth-century translation never intended for children. Despite all the bread, cheese, cabbage and sausage in its pages, they were also full of hunger and want, often linked with making a foolish marriage to a stranger.</p>

  <p>Harriet did this twice. Her own family was irreproachably respectable. Her father, Arthur, was a well-to-do hardware merchant who had sailed to Gisborne from Ireland in 1867 with his much younger bride, Frances Selina. Frances produced ten children and all of them lived. As my mother told it, Harriet was the youngest and most beautiful of four sisters, but she was painfully shy and sensitive, and when her family started taunting her for being an old maid she vowed she’d let any man have her. At twenty-nine she met Hugo Korth, an exotic Polish exile, who fathered her three children – Rurik, my mother Ryda, and their brother Raymond.</p>

  <p>Korth turned out to be a shiftless drunkard. He used to steal vegetables from gardens to feed his family, running home with them at night through the dark streets.</p>

  <p>In all the stories about not having enough to eat, someone is running. Harriet leaves her baby in the tent her husband has put up for them to live in, climbs barbed wire fences, and runs across paddocks to get milk from a farmer. She gets her three children to run around the dining table where she sits with one boiled egg, feeding each a small spoonful as they go past, turning it into a game. She borrows threepence from a neighbour and sends Ryda running to the butcher to buy bones for soup.</p>

  <p>Harriet had to borrow the threepence because the funeral of her second husband had left her penniless. Korth had brought this man home after meeting him in prison; you would have thought that was warning enough. Mr Steele – he was always ‘Mr Steele’ in my mother’s stories – was handsome and well-educated, and he wooed Harriet by bringing her food for her children. In 1913 she managed to get a divorce from Korth on the grounds of habitual drunkenness and failure to support, and the next year she married Mr Steele. According to Mum he was a confirmed bachelor who should never have married a mother with children. He became jealous of Harriet’s love for them and showed it through food: he would buy good fruit for her and spotted fruit for them.</p>

  <p>It didn’t take Harriet long to discover that Mr Steele was a con man and a drug addict. As the money disappeared and his gentlemanly act fell apart, she came up with an idea. Sheets were always wearing out down the centre and having to be turned, sides to middle. Why not reinforce the centre with double weaving so the sheets would last longer? She paid a few shillings to protect her patent and the Scottish firm of Findlay’s agreed to pay her a royalty of one and a half percent on all ‘Backbone’ sheeting sold. With the money, she managed to keep her family fed, paying the grocer every three months when she got her cheque.</p>

  <p>Eleven years later Mr Steele died. By then it was 1925 and all three children were earning. Harriet couldn’t afford to renew her sheeting patent, but she rented a better house and took in lodgers. As far as I know, she and her family never went hungry again.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-paras">I first knew my grandmother when I was four. She was seventy-four and living in a rented villa in tiny Avenham Walk in Mount Eden, close enough to our flat for my mother and me to walk to. She had a strange smell, which I realised later came from the raw garlic she grew and ate to keep germs at bay. She would take me for long walks around Mount Eden, stopping every so often to nip cuttings off plants growing over fences and drop them into the woven flax kete she carried everywhere, except when she dressed up to go to town with my mother. When I went home she would wave goodbye to me at her gate with two arms and a raised leg. Although we visited her often, I have no memory of her ever coming to our place for lunch or tea.</p>

  <p>I was seven when she managed to buy an old house in Greenhithe, near her youngest son and his family. Most Saturday mornings in summer we would catch the car ferry across the harbour, and my father would drive the long winding metalled roads to take my mother, my sister Susan and me to stay with Grandma for the weekend while he went back and worked overtime building new grocery stores.</p>

  <p>The food we ate at Grandma’s was different from that at home, and some of it was awful: pale green, slimy, tasteless chokos, and strangely smooth, flabby, damp little cakes she baked in her small green electric stove to save heating up the big black wood-burning one. I dreaded having to use her forks because there were often tiny bits of dried food stuck to the tines. Her eyesight was failing, the washing-up water wasn’t hot enough, and the lump of Sunlight soap in the wire soap shaker didn’t help much.</p>

  <p>As I grew older I lay for hours under the plum tree on the palm-frond mat Grandma had brought back from her flying-boat visit to my uncle Rurik and his family in Fiji, following the adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel and Tarzan and eating the fat crimson fallen plums before the wasps got to them. At night we made charred smoky toast on a toasting fork over the fire and spread it with the jam that Mum cooked up from the golden cape gooseberries I collected on the vacant section next door, where they ran wild over the warm slab of concrete that had once supported a house.</p>

  <p>On wet days I lay on the worn scratchy carpet square in the front room, working my way through soft white slices of bread spread with smooth butter and just the right amount of Marmite, and a pile of old <span class="italic">Reader’s Digests</span>. The relentlessly detailed accounts of brave American soldiers being tortured by evil Germans and Japanese and Koreans dug a pit of horrified fascination in my stomach as I imagined myself in their helpless place. The bread and Marmite kept the sick, shameful feeling at bay.</p>

  <p>At home I knew nothing of such horrors, any more than I did of hunger and want. Mum and Dad were not rich or even well-off, but only rarely did I pick up the slightest hint of food being hard to come by. Mum told me later that she had trouble managing on the housekeeping money Dad gave her, and often had to ask him for an advance of half a crown or five shillings to tide her over until the next month’s was due. I don’t know how much Dad earned, and Mum never knew either – for years it can’t have been a great deal – but I don’t think he ‘kept her short’, as women used to say.</p>

  <p>Unlike her mother, Mum had chosen wisely: apart from being strikingly good-looking, with dark wavy hair and blue eyes, and always dressing well, Dad was the exact opposite of her father and stepfather – steady, hard-working (despite a painfully locked hip) and totally reliable. Her budgeting problems may have been partly due to the kind of food he insisted on. As far as he was concerned meat was what mattered most. I knew this because Mum would send me to the butcher’s with precise instructions. Steak had to be rump. The Sunday roast had to be hogget, not mutton. Butcher’s mince was not worth buying – I had to ask for a piece of topside, then ask the butcher to mince it.</p>

  <p>I did as I was told, standing on the sawdust (I was a big girl now and no longer tried to play in it), looking up at the burly man in his bloody blue and white striped apron, never quite sure if he was really giving me what Mum wanted. On the way home I would sneak tasty bits of moist pink mince out of the brown paper bag. To hide my raids, just before I got to the back door I would carefully hold the bag by the corners and twirl it over again the way the butcher did. Once I overdid the twirl and the whole pound of mince plopped out on to the metal drain cover under the kitchen window. I couldn’t explain why I’d done it, and Mum was tight-lipped with anger. Rescuing it was unthinkable because of the germs and, although she didn’t say so, she could probably ill afford to buy another lot.</p>

  <p>Going to the shops was my job, but some of our food was even closer to hand. Our flat was on the corner of Mount Eden Road and Valley Road, over a grocer’s shop belonging to the Marriott’s chain owned by L.D. Nathan &amp; Co. Dad had been able to rent the flat – a huge boon in the severe post-war housing shortage – because he was working for Nathan’s as a commercial artist.</p>

  <p>On the wall above the fat boxy leatherette couch was one of his painstaking copies of well-known pictures, a cute Norman Rockwell urchin staring at the old boot snagged on the end of his fishing line. It was hinged to the wall to cover a neat square hole through which Tiny Pine, the tall thin grocer, could pass whatever Mum wanted. If anything was too big, Mr Pine would bring it around when he came to get supplies from the dark forbidden concrete storeroom in the backyard.</p>

  <p>Now and then, though, I was sent to his shop, which smelt of bacon and cheese. I was fascinated by the big square Bycroft biscuit tin, with its picture of a boy running along holding another identical tin, with its picture of a boy running along… Sometimes Mr Pine would give me a free bag of broken biscuits. Mum would let me pick out the bigger bits, and magically transform the rest into chocolate fudge cake with a delicious, surprising mix of softness and crunch.</p>

  <p>Besides running errands, it was my job was to set the table every night in time for tea (we never called it dinner) as soon as Dad got home from work. Mum would fold out the clever gateleg of the table Dad had made from a kitset and spread out two tablecloths, plain brightly coloured cotton covered by clear plastic with a pattern that looked like lace. On it, as well as the four sets of knives, forks and spoons, milk jug, sugar bowl and teapot stand, bread and butter plates, cups and saucers, I had to fit the brown china salt and pepper monks, the red plastic tomato, and the bottle of Worcester sauce. Then came the butter and the plump white half-loaf on its painted breadboard, along with the pots of Marmite and honey. They were there just in case, after the meat, spuds, veges and pudding, someone still felt hungry. (No one ever did.) I think my mother wanted to make sure that, once she had dished up and sat down, the only things she would have to get up for were the pudding and the final pot of tea – although Dad often made that before he did the dishes.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-paras">On the weekends we didn’t go to Grandma’s there was always a roast for Sunday lunch. Chicken and pork were rare treats, saved for special occasions. Mostly Mum served us hogget, or a round of chewy beef criss-crossed with wooden skewers and tied up with string. Once on our plates, the slices of warm meat had a neat curl of butter laid on top to slip down and blend lusciously with the gravy. There would be cold meat for tea that night, with potatoes, new or mashed. In summer we had tomato, cucumber and onion thinly sliced in vinegar, and shredded lettuce in Highlander condensed milk dressing (we never called it mayonnaise). We ate listening to ‘Goodbye, Dolly Gray’ and ‘It’s a Long Way to Tipperary’ and ‘Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag and Smile, Smile, Smile’ on the returned servicemen’s radio request session. If there was enough meat left we had rissoles for Monday’s tea.</p>

  <p>Otherwise there was no dreary set routine for meals. The mince might turn up under crisp pastry or fork-furrowed mash, or curried yellow with sultanas. As well as dark brown rump steak, beef came in corned red slices, or shin meat stew with plump fleshy pieces of kidney. Mutton was fat-fringed chops or thick pale peppery Irish stew. Always meat came with potatoes, and a small range of thoroughly cooked vegetables – kumara, carrots, cabbage, peas (changing over the years from tinned to dried Surprise to frozen), or thick home-grown runner beans sliced into small pieces with their purple and black beans poking out. I liked the peas and beans best. The only vegetables I loathed, and didn’t have to eat, were pumpkin, silverbeet and the repulsive chokos Mum persisted in bringing home from Grandma’s.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, for a change, we had pork sausages or saveloys, and in the height of summer bright pink tinned salmon drowned in malt vinegar. Mum made her own crisply battered fish and chips – the shop’s cooked fish was despised as shark – but our regular Friday treat after late-night shopping was steaming hot chips eaten straight out of the newspaper.</p>

  <p>While there was no hint of tension, conflict or Victorian sternness at our family table, and having tea was much more than a disagreeable necessity, it was not something to be lingered over. The plates were removed the minute we’d finished, and Dad often started the washing-up while I was still eating my pudding. As I grew up, this brusque getting-it-out-of-the-way business loomed unduly large. I yearned for some sense of ceremony, glimpsed in other people’s houses or read about in books, where eating together meant more than just having tea, and guests were readily welcome.</p>

  <p>I don’t think Mum and Dad were in any way ashamed of their food, or their flat above the grocer’s shop. They certainly had nothing to hide: the most officious child welfare officer or health inspector could have turned up at any time of the day or night without finding the smallest speck of transgression. It was more to do with their feeling that living as a family meant shutting other people out, keeping yourselves to yourselves. Tea was not something to be shared, and that was that.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-paras">Like most children, I liked pudding best. In summer we drove out to the Henderson orchards for crates of apples and apricots, plums and pears. Mum spent long hot hours bottling all this fruit in thick Agee jars so we could eat it year-round with hectic yellow custard (made with Edmonds powder) or, after the fridge arrived in 1950, with ice cream. For special occasions we had whipped cream as well. Winter brought rice pudding, or steamed pudding and fruit sponge with yet more custard – I must have eaten oceans of it.</p>

  <p>My favourite was trifle, which combined the lot, plus scented sherry, in a cut-glass bowl showing the layers, but that was a luxury reserved for birthdays, when the beautiful tablecloth embroidered with orange marigolds came out, and for Christmas. The trifle must have appeared at teatime or maybe on New Year’s Day, because no matter how hot it was on Christmas Day, lunch was always roast dinner followed by rich steamed Christmas pudding, studded with carefully distributed silver threepences and served with custard and cream.</p>

  <p>Even at Christmas, I don’t remember anyone else ever joining us. There were always just the four of us sitting down for all that food. Despite the strings of paper chains and Christmas lights, the fizzy raspberry drink and the special Christmas paper serviettes, there always seemed to be a faint sense of anti-climax and disappointment – or maybe I’d just gone flat after the day’s real highlight, diving into the bulging early morning stocking at the foot of the bed.</p>

  <p>In one sense Mum and Dad spoiled me and my sister. Both of them had had difficult, pinched childhoods and were determined their children would want for nothing that was in their power to provide, from weekly roast dinners to extravagant treats for special occasions. At Easter, Dad would give each of us a large hollow egg ringed with chocolates in a glossy white Queen Anne box. I would hoard mine in my room and make it last as long as I could, eating the egg piece by piece and moving on to one chocolate a day, carefully matching the different shapes to the chart of centres in the lid, making sure I kept my favourite green-foiled peppermint crèmes until last. It never occurred to me to share them, and anyway there was no need for such a sacrifice. Mum got her own green-and-gold double-layer box of Winning Post chocolates, and each night after tea, while we listened to <span class="italic">Life with Dexter</span> or Randy Stone’s <span class="italic">Night Beat</span>, she would hand them around until they were all gone.</p>

  <p>I was a solitary, self-absorbed child. I loved to eat and was strongly aware of food, but played almost no part in producing it. The tiny kitchen in our flat had a narrow sink-bench under the window, a gas stove, a wall of cupboards built by Dad, and in time the looming fridge, which arrived when I was five. There was barely enough room left for my petite mother, let alone anyone else. Every so often she would try to get me involved. I was happy enough to lick bowls, cut out biscuits and put jam into tart cases, but I showed little interest in learning anything more and made a mess whenever I tried. My cack-handedness reinforced my mother’s often repeated conviction that I had ‘no brains for anything but school’.</p>

  <p>My cooking teacher at the Normal Intermediate School in Epsom was equally unsuccessful. The curriculum had supposedly been designed for girls who, like me, didn’t know one end of a potato peeler from the other. Once a week I put on an immaculate white apron, washed and ironed by Mum, and a little cap on which I’d embroidered ‘Anne’ in wavering red thread, and went nervously with my class to the huge sunny cookery room, where the shining electric stoves looked nothing like Mum’s battered old gas one.</p>

  <p>We worked in pairs, one measuring out the ingredients, the other following the cooking instructions. We were supposed to swap roles every week. Convinced I couldn’t cook and would simply make a fool of myself, I foiled the system by talking my partners into letting me do the measuring.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be almost no connection between the food we made and sometimes ate in class and what we had at home. Nothing was ever fried in that pristine school kitchen, and nothing came out of tins. Every second lesson seemed to involve floury, lumpy, tasteless white sauce; I carried home a procession of sad little enamel pie dishes containing awful things such as leeks lying dead under a thick blanket of it.</p>

  <p>The best part was the baking but we rarely got to eat any of it, let alone take it home. At lunchtime on baking days the hot grubby boys would pile out from their mysterious metalwork or woodwork classes and surround us, begging for a louise cake or a melting moment. For a few glowing minutes we would have their complete attention; as soon as the food was gone we once more ceased to exist.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-paras">At Auckland Girls’ Grammar I discovered that other girls could not only swim, play hockey and drive, all skills I lacked, they could also cook. I was the odd one out. I started trying to copy them by making fudge at home. Even when it refused to set, as it usually did because I lost my nerve and took it off the heat too soon, the soft chocolate sludge was thoroughly satisfying. At my best friend Camille’s state house in Waterview we would make the fudge together and carry it off to eat in her bedroom, away from her sister and four brothers.</p>

  <p>It was my friend Cheryll’s cooking that impressed me most. I met Cheryll through Debating when I was in the sixth form. She went to St Mary’s College, a Catholic girls’ school in Ponsonby, and lived with her mother and sister in a state house in Mount Roskill. The first time I went to her house she made pizza with scone dough, and I think she used grated Chesdale cheese. I liked this exotic food so much I took home the recipe and persuaded my mother to help me make it. The instructions for scone dough pizza are still out there on the internet, although now the suggested toppings include mozzarella, basil pesto and sun-dried tomatoes.</p>

  <p>By then, thanks to a legacy from Uncle Frank, Grandma’s one wealthy brother, we had moved from the flat to our own house. It was a 1920s bungalow in Garry Road, one of the little hidden-away, no-exit Mt Eden streets I liked so much. The house had a large, light kitchen, made even bigger when my father knocked down the wall separating it from the back-porch laundry. There was plenty of room for me to learn to cook and my mother tried again, but apart from making fudge and pizza I was happy to leave the whole business to her.</p>
