<title>I GOT HIS BLOOD ON ME</title>
</head>

        <div class="booksection">
          <h1>I GOT HIS BLOOD ON ME</h1>

<p class="noindent">The man bled on the motorway. Then he bled on the verge, the safety barrier, and the slip-road—and that’s where I found him, a pale shape staggering there, blankets and weapons falling from him. I was driving back from Paekākāriki at the time. I’d gone south to clear my mind, and in that half-awake state drove straight past him, then flashed with the after-image of what I’d seen. A man, a badly wounded one. Blood on his face, weapons. </p>

<p class="indent">I reared around in my seat and saw it again. ‘What the hell?’ I said, my voice strange in the empty car. </p>

<p class="indent">I pulled right off the road and climbed out the passenger side. He was a hundred metres back, wavering down the exit to the slip-road. I called out, but he didn’t turn. At my side motorists streaked past, their faces blankly focused on the motorway.</p>

<p class="indent">I ran towards him and he collapsed and began hauling up on his rifle, hand over hand, then fell again. I picked up speed, my jandals flailing. By the time I reached him he was face down on the tarseal, a pair of knives tangled in his blanket, the ancient rifle fallen to the side. Ginger hair slewed on his white shoulders. With his hand he held his knee-joint together. It was twisted and leaking blood. Above that his thigh bent outwards, snapped obtusely. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Sir?’ I said, bending to him. ‘I’ll ring an ambulance, okay?’ </p>

<p class="indent">He turned and stared up, and I recoiled. Blood spilled from a gash above his hairline, sluicing into his right eye and dripping down. When he tried to speak, blood streamed in round his teeth and gums. </p>

<p class="indent">I wrenched away and dialed 111. Just as I got through to the emergency operator, the man garbled something. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Pardon?’ I said, bending down.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Who are you?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘David,’ I said. ‘I’m here to help you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He stared at me, then turned to pull away on his elbow. Something about my answer had scared him. But he couldn’t get far. The movement dislodged his hand from his knee and he grabbed at it, grunting. </p>

<p class="indent">I went back to the phone call, told the operator where we were. There was a pause while she worked with the information. </p>

<p class="indent">The man mouthed at me again, making signs with his hand. He was deathly white now, and blood was in his throat somehow.</p>

<p class="indent">‘What was that?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">He indicated my phone, my talking. ‘What are you doing?’ His voice had a rough and ancient sound, like old England. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Ringing 111,’ I said. ‘It’s all right. The ambulance is coming. You’ll be away in no time.’ </p>

<p class="indent">At this he didn’t sag back as I’d expected, surrendering to the promise of relief from his pain. Instead he tried to drag away again, knives scraping on the tarseal. </p>

<p class="indent">The operator was requesting more information. I described the man’s condition, and this he understood, turning to wave at me violently, gargling in words I couldn’t make out. I went across and bent right down to hear him. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Who?’ he said. ‘Who?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m talking to the ambulance. It’s all right, they’re coming.’</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head and coughed to clear his throat. ‘Who? Which are they?’ </p>

<p class="indent">The operator was talking in my ear. I pulled the phone away. ‘What do you mean?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Which lot? Which hapū?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘Why does that matter? They might be Pākehā, for all I know. Just ambulance people.’ </p>

<p class="indent">One hand holding his knee, he looked around wildly, as if this ambulance might appear from anywhere—from the whizzing motorway at the side, from the air buffeted by cars. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Neutral,’ I said, ‘they’ll be neutral. They won’t hurt you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘They’ll be English?’ he said. ‘English Pākehā?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘No, just locals,’ I said. ‘I don’t know—bloody hell, they’ll be doctors. They’ll take you to hospital, man, fix you up.’</p>

<p class="indent">This panicked him even more. Hauling up, he tried to crutch away on his musket, but collapsed loudly, his knives and musket clattering. </p>

<p class="indent">The operator was talking in my ear. ‘Are you safe, sir? Are you well off the motorway?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Something’s strange,’ I said. ‘I think this man might have been in trouble with the law. He’s scared about strangers or the ambulance, or something.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘That’s okay,’ she said. ‘Thank you for your help. We’re on our way.’</p>

<p class="indent">I put my phone away and breathed deep, my hands shaking. ‘Jesus,’ I said, out loud. The rest of the morning was so normal—a fine sky, swampy raupō paddocks at the side. I was in my T-shirt and jandals. I was unshaven and unshowered. I’d just come down to Paekākāriki for a few things, and really just to get out of the house, to give Mary some room. We’d both been disestablished recently—our jobs had—and we weren’t getting along. I was at a low ebb, and so was she. I certainly wasn’t prepared for an emergency. I wasn’t prepared for anything. </p>

<p class="indent">A short distance up the slip-road, the man was face down and seemed to have fainted. I sparked with an idea and sprinted back to my car. A half-empty Powerade bottle was in the passenger footwell. I ran back and lifted his head, the ginger curls greasy in my palm. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Drink,’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">His head lolled on my knees, and at first the Powerade dribbled over his lips to the ground, but something of the sugar must have found its way in, because he parted his lips and half-swallowed, then took another swallow and a little more. He tried to say something, then coughed and spat a clot of blood on the stones. Something was badly wrong in there, but he was desperate to say something. He was asking my name again. </p>

<p class="indent">‘David Miller,’ I said. ‘I live up the road.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘But who are you? Who are you from?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m sorry,’ I said. ‘I don’t understand the question.’</p>

<p class="indent">He closed his eyes and switched languages, as if that was the problem. I couldn’t catch it at first, but he repeated and simplified until I heard, ‘Nō whea koe?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m from Paraparaumu Beach,’ I said. ‘I’m not from the police or the jail. I won’t lock you away. It’s just your leg, mate—it needs a doctor. And your chest. Then you can go home.’</p>

<p class="indent">I could hear the sirens screaming up the motorway. I took in the musket he’d abandoned now, the blanket he wore. ‘Where is that, by the way?’ I said. ‘Where are <i>you</i> from?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Promise to protect me,’ he gasped. ‘You promise I won’t go to jail.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I can guarantee it,’ I said. It pleased me to be on this safe ground—hospitals, the complaints process, his rights as a client of the health system. It was my field, or at least it had been. ‘You should tell me your name and address, though,’ I said. ‘I’ll be able to help you better, if I know.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m not giving my name.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘That’s fine,’ I said. ‘They’ll ask you, anyway.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Smith,’ he said. ‘Call me Smith. That’s my name.’</p>

<p class="indent">I laughed. ‘Sure it is, mate. I believe you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">The ambulance lumbered down the slip-road and into a wide turn above us, its lights swirling. The doors opened and both officers came running. Smith heaved up and saw the officers and the big, lit vehicle. He saw their uniforms. His eyes went wide with a new fear. He snarled an unplaceable curse, squirming against me and jabbing with his elbows until he lost his grip and the kneecap swung loose to dangle free, blood looping down. </p>

<p class="indent">The detached kneecap stunned us both. I stared at its strings of blood, then at him, and his eyes went right into me. Then he mouthed a silent howl of pain and sagged back against the road. His eyes closed, and I felt the ambulance people pulling me by the shoulder, lifting me away. </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">Smith was unconscious throughout his transfer into the ambulance and onto the motorway. I sat near the doors while an ambulance officer worked over him. It was not until Pukerua Bay that I thought about Mary, my fingers jittering on the keypad as I rang her at home. </p>

<p class="indent">In fairness to her, she had no idea where I was, or what had happened, and she was waiting for another call. She’d interviewed for a job at MSD lately. She had the experience, and a second interview seemed likely. All the same it jolted me to hear how her voice flattened when she realised it was me. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Yep,’ she said. ‘Hi.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I saw her in our kitchen, one eye on the laptop screen, scrolling through further job ads while she waited for me to continue. Being without a job was much worse for her than it was for me.</p>

<p class="indent">Something was sticky against my ear. I pulled the phone away and found it smeared with Smith’s blood. I wiped it on my thigh. </p>

<p class="indent">‘What is it, David?’ said Mary. </p>

<p class="indent">I looked at the ambulance officer. He was busy not listening. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’ve had an adventure,’ I said. ‘There was an accident—I’m not hurt, though. It’s another guy. I’m helping him.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Mary’s listening changed. I saw her looking out our kitchen window, trying to make sense of what I was saying. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I found him on the road,’ I said. ‘It was a car accident. He’s pretty smashed up. I’m fine. You don’t know the guy.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘So you’re okay,’ she said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m in the ambulance now. My car’s on the motorway, just past Paekākāriki.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I thought you weren’t in the accident. Why are you in the ambulance? Why’s your car there?’ </p>

<p class="indent">I shook my head. I shouldn’t have tried to shortcut such a conversation. ‘I’m not hurt. I’m helping the other guy. I’m kind of supporting him.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘So you saw the accident?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Sorry,’ I said. ‘I’m confusing you.’</p>

<p class="indent">I saw her waving this away. ‘Jesus, David. Where are you?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘On my way to Wellington. It might take a while.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She fell silent again, and the ambulance curved up the hill towards Pukerua Bay. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m sorry about this,’ I said. ‘I should have called you first. Did you want to use my car today?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘No. I’ve got mine. Why would I need yours?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Sorry,’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">She was quiet for a time. Then she said, ‘I’m confused about this, David. But I suppose you know what you’re doing.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘It’s fine,’ I said. ‘I’m just helping a guy. I’ll ring you again.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Right,’ she said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Sorry,’ I said. ‘See you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She rang off and I lingered over it, cradling the phone in my hand while, out the rear window, the last view of Kāpiti Island swayed out of sight. I was disorientated now that I’d spoken to Mary. I wanted her beside me. Just a few years back we’d taken this trip up to Wellington every day, not in an ambulance but in the train, commuting to work side by side. Sometimes Mary would fall asleep against me, twitching as the music in her earphones shifted and sighed. She’d never bothered looking out at the view—she’d been born there, she was local, she knew it well. </p>

<p class="indent">I was the opposite. I was new in the area and eager to understand it all, to know all the stories. The old pā sites and middens and names. Paraparaumu. Wharemauku Road. In those first years I read all the old books and enrolled in a class in te reo. It was an exciting time—all that discovery, all those stories.</p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">Smith was sleeping the sleep, it seemed, of centuries. Even as he was unloaded and taken in for triage his eyes remained closed, his face deeply gone. Still in my shorts and T-shirt I was left behind in a waiting room, holding his weapons in a brown paper rubbish bag, sneaking a look through it when I got bored. Besides the long and awkward musket that poked out the top there were two knives, another steel blade with a handle of harakeke stalk, and a needle-like weapon or hook made of bone. Maybe it was a hairpin—I couldn’t tell. A leather pouch held something that I assumed was gunpowder. Nothing else, no wallet or phone, nothing to identify him. </p>

<p class="indent">At length a junior doctor came and explained the extent of Smith’s injuries and what was planned for him, including a knee-procedure that, even in his clinical description, screamed with pain. Then I was shown a bathroom where I could sponge the blood from my clothes. </p>

<p class="indent">On the train home I watched Tawa and Porirua and Plimmerton go past, remembering it all, what I’d read in undergrad and those first Kāpiti days. By the time we hit Paraparaumu I had a theory about him, about where he’d come from. It excited me.</p>

<p class="indent">But when I got home I didn’t share it with Mary. As soon as I opened the door it was obvious that something was wrong. She didn’t look up when I came in. Instead she silently turned the pages of a magazine, her knees pulled up on a couch pillow. Right away I could see that the phone call had come—another ‘no thank you’.</p>

<p class="indent">‘It’s all right,’ she said. ‘I knew it was coming.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I was standing just inside the door. She should have been given the job. It was at MSD, and below her pay range. I knew better than to go across and hug her, so instead I just stood there, big and useless while her magazine made loud rasping noises, each page catching on her day-at-home jeans.</p>

<p class="indent">At length she looked up again. ‘What was this accident?’ </p>

<p class="indent">I told her the basics. I didn’t go into my theories about Smith, but I heard my tone change as I hinted at his mystery and made light of my own role in his rescue, and Mary heard it too. She glanced at me, knowing I had more to say, knowing I had a theory, and deciding to let it go. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m sorry I was confusing on the phone,’ I said. ‘I wasn’t clear at all.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head—it didn’t matter now. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I promised to help him,’ I said. ‘He was freaking out. He thought they were going to take him to jail.’ I looked about the kitchen. ‘I’d better visit him again. I promised to help him.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Mary said nothing. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Weird day, huh?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">She was looking at her magazine, but she didn’t seem to have it in focus anymore. I wanted to go across to her. She had an MBA. Her career mattered to her. She’d applied for so many jobs now. There was nothing. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m sorry about today,’ I said. ‘That stupid MSD thing. It doesn’t mean anything, you know.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head, not looking up. ‘It wasn’t stupid, David. I just didn’t get it.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Sorry,’ I said. ‘I didn’t mean anything by that.’ </p>

<p class="indent">But she stood up and went down the hall. I was just inside the door. I hadn’t even sat down yet. My car was still out on the motorway.</p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">When I next visited Smith I brought magazines and books and a box file. I was keyed-up. I’d dug up my old books and developed my theory. He was from another time. He’d stepped through a time hole and onto the motorway. Nothing else could explain his appearance, his behaviour. His ignorance of what an ambulance was. His hope for help from a local hapū. He still thought he lived way back then, still thought Pākehā were the minority. He was a Pākehā-Māori, some early adventurer or trader or stray, sheltered and absorbed by locals. </p>

<p class="indent">I’d not told Mary yet, but I was thrilled. This was a boyhood fantasy come alive.</p>

<p class="indent">As a boy I’d devoured old history stories, so many and so intently that their characters came very close and real. Right through my school years they hovered there—always—just beyond. In my fantasy one of these characters turned up in my home town, disorientated and in need of a guide, and I showed them around. <i>This is a car</i>, I said, pointing. <i>This is a telephone. You can talk to me, using this—I’ll show you</i>. I dreamed it so often that it became a kind of certainty. Hongi Hika, Wild Bill Hickok, Baron Charles de Thierry—all of these were in my future, lost in a shopping mall or movie theatre and awaiting rescue. </p>

<p class="indent">Now it was happening. This guy had walked right out of history and onto the motorway. I had a stack of questions for him. </p>

<p class="indent">When I got to the hospital I found he’d been operated on. His leg was cocooned in a titanium brace and suspended from the bed-frame by a shackle. On my arrival he fixed me with a look of cold ferocity, even as I smiled and extended my hand. </p>

<p class="indent">‘And here is the man who betrayed me,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m sorry?’ </p>

<p class="indent">For answer he just glared at me. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Do you remember me?’ I said. ‘I’m David, from the roadside, the accident.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Yes. I remember you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I stood very still, my excitement draining. ‘So why are you saying that I betrayed you?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘You said you’d protect me,’ he said. ‘Funny kind of protection.’</p>

<p class="indent">I took in the room, his curtained enclosure, the drip he was hooked into. Bandages humped over his forehead and shoulder, a long stretch of his forearm. Then I saw the canvas straps that held him down. Partly obscured by the sheets, his wrists and abdomen and his good leg were secured to the bed-frame. He’d been restrained.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh God,’ I said. ‘Did you fight the doctors, Smith? Did you hurt someone?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Of course I hurt them.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh Christ,’ I said. ‘That wasn’t a good idea, Smith. They’ll call the police on you. I can’t help you if you assault people.’</p>

<p class="indent">Smith looked balefully out the door. I tried to make up a little ground. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Can I help with anything? Is there someone I could phone? Do you have a wife, or a next of kin?’ </p>

<p class="indent">He glowered and said nothing. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m just trying to help you,’ I said. ‘There’s not much I can do without information.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m not going to tell you, am I?’ he said. With his eyes he indicated his shackled leg, his pinioned arms. ‘Look where your help has got me, Miller. Where are my weapons?’ </p>

<p class="indent">It scared me a little that he’d remembered my last name. I couldn’t even remember giving it to him.</p>

<p class="indent">‘It looks like they’ve fixed your knee, Smith,’ I said. ‘And your broken leg, and your lungs. And you’ll get to go home eventually.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘When?’ he said.</p>

<p class="indent">‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘Ask your doctors.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘<i>You</i> ask them,’ he said. ‘You tell them.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I took a breath and tried to keep calm. ‘All right,’ I said. ‘I can do that. It would be helpful, though, if you could tell me your next of kin and your real name. It would speed things up, both now and later on.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He looked at the TV that was suspended from the highest point at the end of the bed-frame. It wasn’t turned on.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Like, when were you born? Was it, like ... recently? And where?’</p>

<p class="indent">He narrowed his eyes, then reached for the remote and fumbled around with it, and finally turned on the TV. </p>

<p class="indent">‘All right,’ I said. ‘I’ll find out what I can about your treatment. But I don’t think you’ll be getting out of here soon. You were pretty banged up when I found you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Commercials were playing; he found the volume control and cranked it very loud. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I brought some magazines,’ I said, pulling them from my bag. ‘I got you the sports section of the paper, as well. I don’t know if you like sport? I do.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He didn’t even look at them.</p>

<p class="indent">‘That’s all right,’ I said. ‘You’re welcome.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Noise came from the commercials, nothing from Smith. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Did you hear me?’ I said. ‘You’re welcome. For the magazines I brought you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I can’t read them, can I,’ said Smith. ‘I can’t <i>read</i>.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh,’ I said. ‘Well, you’ve got the TV. Someone showed you how to use it, I see.’</p>

<p class="indent">He held the remote and watched the screen.</p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m going now,’ I said, ‘but I’ll come again. Tell the hospital to call me if you need anything, plus you can push that button there for help, anytime.’ I indicated the console next to his bed, but didn’t go near it. I was reluctant to walk too close to him. ‘Maybe you knew that already,’ I said, ‘about the nurse button.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He didn’t look at me or the console. </p>

<p class="indent">I stood to go. I had brought an old cellphone with me; I’d planned to show him how to contact me anytime, but now I decided to leave that for another visit. I went to the door and gave him a wave but he didn’t even acknowledge me, not even with a flicker of his eyes. Instead he continued to watch the screen, as if I’d never been there. </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">It was two days before I saw him again. The time in between was spent reading in my shed and avoiding Mary, and shopping at Paraparaumu, that vast emporium for food and Warehouse clothing. It was a tiring place, Paraparaumu, and parking was a nightmare, but I liked it as a distraction from redundancy. It had a great name. One old book had it translated as ‘Plenty of Food’, and I still liked that interpretation. It seemed so current, somehow. You could still see it in the teeming mall and the Pak’nSave. </p>

<p class="indent">When I returned to the hospital Smith was out to it, sleeping. I sat a safe distance from him, watching his orange hair frizz about him on the pillow. I wondered where his weapons were now. I wanted to get a photograph of them. I also wanted to sneak a picture of him. I was fishing in my bag for the camera when he woke up and turned towards me, and I froze. For a long moment he eyed me and I tried to smile. Then he growled to clear his throat.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Morning,’ he said.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Hi,’ I said, replacing my camera. ‘I brought these.’</p>

<p class="indent">He watched without comment as I brought out chocolates, a magazine, and a pictorial history of Kāpiti. </p>

<p class="indent">‘How are you?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">He rested his eyes on me a while, letting me feel the weight of his stare.</p>

<p class="indent">‘I don’t have to stay,’ I said. ‘If you’d rather be alone, I can go.’</p>

<p class="indent">He let the silence stretch out some more, then said, ‘I can’t sleep at night.’ He indicated his cocooned leg, then his ribcage. ‘The pain. Can you get me more medicine?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘More morphine?’ I said. ‘I can certainly ask for you.’</p>

<p class="indent">As he watched me I had the feeling I was being appraised—gauged for my uses—until he was taken by a noise in the corridor. It was an orderly with trays, and I noted the look of darting and sideways cunning Smith sent out there, and realised it was an old part of his character reasserting itself after the accident, not something new. </p>

<p class="indent">I swallowed against something unpleasant in my mouth. ‘Is there anything else I can do?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘No,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Are you sure?’ I said. ‘It’s no problem.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m fine.’ He watched the TV again, and I looked up there too, waiting. A few minutes passed. </p>

<p class="indent">I began packing my things to go. </p>

<p class="indent">Smith slid his eyes over me again. ‘It’s good to have someone to talk to.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I can imagine,’ I said. ‘It’s good for me too.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He smoothed the sheets over himself and looked out the window. A stretch of the town belt was visible out there. ‘I realised something today,’ he said. ‘I’ve been here before. This area—I remember now. I remember that ridgeline from the time I came here. It was with my wife’s people.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I held my breath and leaned forward slightly. </p>

<p class="indent">He pretended not to notice. ‘We got caught by the weather, once. We were out in the boats, heading towards the other island on a scouting mission when a bad wind blew up and pushed us through the strait, and we had to pull in here. Our boats were damaged and we had to leave them—and they were good boats too; a Pākehā boat we’d bought in flax trading, and a waka, which I didn’t travel in. When they smashed up we had to pull in here and walk all the way back to Kāpiti.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Wow.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He smoothed his hair back, taking his time. ‘The big Pākehā settlement wasn’t here then, of course. Not that I remember, anyway. Maybe a tent or two. It was Māori territory still, but not <i>our</i> territory, and we had to keep our heads down. That’s why I remember that ridgeline. There was good cover up there.’</p>

<p class="indent">I leaned to trace the skyline of town belt out the window. </p>

<p class="indent">‘This was with your wife’s people?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Āe,’ he said. ‘Six of us men—all young.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Again I felt the sliding weight of his eyes. I had so many questions—I was excited—but I kept my tone even. ‘Interesting,’ I said. ‘You made it back, I take it?’</p>

<p class="indent">He had a way of letting silence seep in, and he exercised it now. He eased back on his pillow and sighed. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Are you tired?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’ll sleep now,’ he said. ‘I’ll tell you another time.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Absolutely,’ I said, leaning back. ‘That’s fine.’</p>

<p class="indent">He closed his eyes. I gathered my bags and sneaked another glimpse at him and yearned again, now his eyes were closed, to photograph him. I didn’t risk it, though. Instead, I looked out the window at the view he’d indicated, and fired with the picture he must have made out there, bright-haired and white in the clothes of his in-laws, prowling that Wellington ridgeline. </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">Mary had stopped going to the gym, and it scared me. She hadn’t missed it for such a long stretch since her parents’ accident. Every morning her gear confronted me in the bathroom, the zippered bag drifted with lint from our accumulated towels. It did nothing for her tension—our collective tension. At night she lay in a taut shape, facing away from me, not sleeping. She didn’t turn when I came in from the shed or from town. </p>

<p class="indent">‘How are you, honey? Did you go out today?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Yes, David. I went out today.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Every night the list of things I could say on greeting Mary without exasperating her shrank a little more. I became practiced at coming in quietly, easing into my side of the bed and shielding my light to read as she lay the other way, finally sighing up out of bed to sit in the kitchen or walk down by the sea. She no longer told me what jobs she’d applied for; in fact the ‘j’ word no longer passed between us at all. </p>

<p class="indent">As for my own new project on Smith, she showed no enthusiasm for him, beyond a vague but unspoken irritation at my trips down to see him, as if she knew I didn’t really need to go but enjoyed the chance to leave home, and knew that she couldn’t mention it, not now anyway. Soon Smith was just another subject to estrange us, another thing we couldn’t mention as we passed each other in the hallway or the kitchen, our eyes looking away and our faces closed. </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">And so Smith started with his stories. </p>

<p class="indent">‘We were shifting tons of flax by this time. We had dozens of people working the plantations, and we were getting forty pound a ton for it at point of sale. So it was a real operation. You should have seen the stores.’ He shook his head as if still amazed. ‘I don’t say this to boast, but the price was twenty quid when I first started with them, and I got it up to forty pounds. That was my job, you see. That’s how I got on with my wife’s people. I could barter in English with the ships’ captains, and I could bump up those prices.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Go on,’ I said. I was on a hospital chair by his bed, leaning forward to catch it all, wishing I could record him surreptitiously. </p>

<p class="indent">‘But we had our rivals. Everyone wanted a piece of the trade. One time I’d made a deal at Scotch Jock’s with a trader who was in from Sydney, and it was getting on for dusk when I left there. Scotch Jock’s was a sort of pub, you see. Bloody rough, mind you. It was just a hut up the coast there.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’ve read about Scotch Jock’s. So you went there?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Āe, and as I walked down from Scotch Jock’s I got jumped by these four. It was a jack-up, of course. The idea was to kidnap me and force me to trade for them, but luckily I had my flax knife hidden under my armpit, here.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I leaned to see where he pointed, and he nodded, pleased at my attention. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Āe, I always wore a leather belt there, to secure an extra weapon. You could hide it under your blanket and no one would know. I wore it everywhere, and my wāhine used to complain—why did I have to wear this knife everywhere, even in our own whare. Well, I was glad of it now these boys were on me. I’d stabbed the nearest one before he’d even grabbed me properly. I got him here.’</p>

<p class="indent">Again I leaned to check the point of entry.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Then I twisted fast on the second and stabbed him in the eye. That slowed him down, but of course the blade got stuck in his eye-socket, so I couldn’t pull it out to have another go. So I had to kick the third one on the side of the knee about four times until I broke it for him. This was in bare feet, mind you.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Where was the fourth man?’ I said. ‘What was he doing?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh, he was just a kid and he was looking scared. By the time I got to him he’d pissed himself—a big puddle on the mud underneath him—and all I had to do was screw his ear and push him into the toe-toe.’ Now some hospital staff clattered past with a trolley of meals, and he paused to peer out at what his dinner might be. ‘Yes, it was a good scrap, that one, but I broke my toe on that third man. It’s been bent right back over on itself, ever since, just like a horseshoe.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Which one?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘The third man. The one whose knee I broke.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘No, which toe? On which foot?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘That one,’ he said, and I laughed. He’d pointed at the leg that was encased in plaster and shackled high, the bent-back horseshoe toe safely hidden from view. </p>

<p class="indent">It became obvious that a fair amount of what he told me was lies. He’d never had a quiet day, apparently. He’d never fixed a mate’s roof or worked in a garden. It was all fighting and plotting and screwing ships’ captains in trade, and Smith always to the forefront in everything. </p>

<p class="indent">It was my own fault, though. One night I’d left some of my cruder books on Pākehā-Māori in the hospital, next to his bedside pile of <i>TV Guides</i>, and though he couldn’t read them, he seemed to have picked up something from the older and more basic stories, as from that point his yarns became more bloody and exaggerated, giving me what he must have decided I expected to hear. </p>

<p class="indent">It was still fascinating—I still loved to guess at the real story behind these tales, still yearned to take his photo, had even started to outline an article I would write in my shed and submit to someone—but eventually it got frustrating. It hurt me more than I liked to admit, Smith’s lying. I’d saved him from the motorway, and every day now I was making life better for him—talking to his nurses, bringing food, paying for the slot-card that fed his television. It hurt me that, after all my help, he never shared any of the real information that proper friends share. Instead he just watched me with those canny eyes and fed me these stories. </p>

<p class="indent">Then during one visit he set about explaining a scar on his shoulder, a pucker of thickened skin in the shape of a butterfly. ‘It was a real stoush, that one,’ he said, fingering the scar. ‘Phew.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘What about?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh, it was a disagreement,’ he said. ‘A long story.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘With who?’ I said. ‘Where?’ </p>

<p class="indent">He glanced at me, then out the window. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘down the coast there.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Where, exactly?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Round where I live now. Down there.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Where’s that?’ I said. ‘You haven’t told me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He smiled faintly and eased his head on the pillow. Keep this up, his smile seemed to say. I’m better at it than you. ‘Anyhow we snuck up in the night, and got right inside their pā. Then we ambushed them before dawn. We hit them while they were just waking up.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I smiled and sat back. ‘Uh-huh.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Actually they were heading for water—for the creek that was just there.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Right,’ I said.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Āe, and there were five of them, and half a dozen of us. Big men—they were all big, Miller. Their best fighters, eh.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘What were they doing fetching water?’ I said. ‘Surely that wasn’t their job. You said there were slaves. I thought the slaves would fetch water.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Well, these were toa,’ he said. ‘These weren’t slaves.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘That’s interesting.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Well, I didn’t stop to ask questions about who was supposed to fetch water,’ he said. ‘There was no time for talking. We had a job to do, and it wasn’t to hariru, Miller. This was real.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I’ll bet,’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I wasn’t the first one into the fighting, but I did my share.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘What did you use?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh,’ he said, ‘I suppose I used the mere. I had a whole lot of weapons to choose from, by then. I’d earned them.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Through fighting?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Of course.’</p>

<p class="indent">I smiled. I’d never seen this mere. I’d seen his knives and his musket. Perhaps he’d seen a mere once, maybe even been allowed to handle one. But even as I grinned he kept rattling on about the spectacular violence of the fight he’d survived and the improbable odds he’d overcome.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile I bent to my bag and thumbed through a file of notes I’d made. Then I interrupted him. ‘You know, I read something about the first Pākehā who came here. I thought it might interest you. It said some Pākehā-Māori who recorded their stories, particularly those who returned to London or resettled in Pākehā towns, lied about their experiences.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Not looking at him, I began reading from my notes as if quoting someone. ‘They exaggerated the violence of tribal life and their own part in conflict for the sake of their audiences, back in Britain. The clerks and coffeehouse-dwellers of London wanted swashbuckling tales of a perilous frontier, so that’s what some of these returned Pākehā-Māori gave them.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I glanced at Smith. He wasn’t looking at me. He’d pulled his bed-sheets close, resumed something of his old haughty mien. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Complicating things, some lied to protect their real stories from becoming known,’ I said, reading on. ‘Some of these were deserters, escaped convicts, and renegade sailors—in some cases, they’d jumped ship or run from the cruelest exploitation, and were lucky to be sheltered by Māori people. On their return some lied to protect their identities. They took new names and hid behind fantastical stories because they were scared of being imprisoned again, or because their fantasies of adventure were more entertaining for their audiences.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Smith was not listening, or pretending not to. </p>

<p class="indent">I continued ‘quoting’ the handwritten lines I’d made up myself by mangling several extracts of books with my own guesswork about Smith’s vulnerability. By the time I’d finished he was staring stony-faced out the door. For my part I sat there feeling neither triumphant nor dirty, but something in between. </p>

<p class="indent">Smith reached to his bedside cabinet and I flinched, half-standing in fear, but he was just retrieving the remote control. My reaction amused him though, and he smiled as he thumbed on the TV. </p>

<p class="indent">I sat waiting for a full ten minutes while he watched a <i>Shortland Street</i> rerun. Then another programme came on and I realised that he wouldn’t talk to me again, that day. I left then, taking my books and my bag with me.</p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">It went downhill after that. I visited Smith twice more, and each time he ignored me for the whole half-hour of my visit, staring up at the television as if I wasn’t even there, so I stopped bringing him food and newspapers, and finally stopped visiting. He had no one else and it felt unfair, but I couldn’t keep that up. It was degrading. </p>

<p class="indent">Then one night I decided to try one more time, made desperate after playing touch with my old Ministry team. It was humiliating to be the one disestablished guy in the side. I’d never been one of the playmakers or even very reliable, yet now everyone passed me the ball more frequently than usual, out of pity, and I dropped it with a correspondingly higher frequency. </p>

<p class="indent">When I arrived I found Smith had been shifted to a window bay, his bed angled towards it and tilted right up. He was gazing out at the dusk. I said hello and was ignored and plonked myself in a chair, wondering what I was doing there. It was obvious Smith wouldn’t talk to me. It seemed unlikely he’d ever talk to me again. The visit would only make me late home, and when I got back Mary would be in bed, but not sleeping. I’d come in quietly and pitch my voice at a non-intrusive hello, and she wouldn’t even turn over to see me. She’d wait silently for me to extinguish my light, then go on lying in the same position. </p>

<p class="indent">A long period of silence ensued, Smith staring into the darkening hills of Newtown. Then he turned and said, ‘How many guards are there?’ </p>

<p class="indent">At first I was so surprised that I didn’t reply. It had been so long since he’d spoken to me, plus he’d gained weight and recovered that cold stare. </p>

<p class="indent">‘In this hospital?’ I said. ‘I don’t know. Heaps—hundreds, maybe.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Liar,’ he said. ‘How many?’ </p>

<p class="indent">I looked out the window and shook my head. It was just like before, Smith using me to get chocolates and morphine. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I don’t know, Smith,’ I said. ‘I don’t really care.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘There’s only one guard in this ward,’ he said. ‘There’s only been one this whole day.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I wouldn’t try anything, Smith,’ I said. ‘You’ll get arrested if you assault someone. They’ll put you in jail.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘You’d like that, wouldn’t you,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Pardon me?’</p>

<p class="indent">For answer he turned back to the window. Then he said, as if reflecting on the weather out there, ‘I might slit your throat tomorrow.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I gaped, tried to swallow, said nothing. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’d quite like to slit your throat,’ he said. ‘I think you’d squeal. Just like a wee piggy, fresh from the barn.’</p>

<p class="indent">I glanced at the door. I was very aware of my sitting position, of how quickly I could get out. </p>

<p class="indent">The bed-metal clinked as he turned to face me better. ‘Why don’t you go home, Miller?’ </p>

<p class="indent">I recrossed my legs, smoothed my palms. ‘I will. I’m aiming at the nine o’clock train.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘No, why don’t you go home permanently? Why do you keep coming here?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I don’t know, Smith,’ I said. ‘Why don’t you tell me? You seem to be very talkative today.’</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled. ‘Answer my question, Miller.’ </p>

<p class="indent">It was hard to look at him. ‘I suppose I feel I’m obliged. I promised, remember? You made me promise, when I scraped you off the road.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Ah yes,’ he said, amused. ‘And?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘And you don’t seem to have any other visitors, besides me. I’m doing you a favour.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘But you come here all the time,’ he said. ‘Don’t you have work to go to?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m disestablished,’ I said. ‘They got rid of my job.’</p>

<p class="indent">He grinned. ‘So you lied about working for the Government.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I did not,’ I said. ‘I worked for the Ministry for twelve years. I lost my job two months ago. I still consider myself a civil servant, Smith.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘So you did lie,’ he said. ‘Besides, that doesn’t explain why you keep coming here.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I don’t <i>keep coming here</i>. I visit you.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘You love it,’ he said. ‘And I know why. You’re planning an exhibition. You plan to put me up for display.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Don’t be ridiculous,’ I said. ‘That’s so paranoid.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Look at the Pākehā-Māori,’ he said. ‘Look at his weapons. That savage. How could he. I bet he took a native wife, and everything. How could he.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘You’re an idiot, Smith,’ I said. ‘No one’s like that anymore.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Say what you like,’ he said. ‘I’ve seen your books, your little mind working. I’ve seen your plan.’</p>

<p class="indent">I laughed and looked elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">Again he shifted on the bed to face me better. It was a slow and menacing lumber of limbs and the bed-frame. He waited until I could face him. ‘Well?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Maybe I’ve developed an interest in you,’ I said. ‘In your story. But only because I like adventure stories—I always have. That’s not a crime.’</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled and bunched his hair back as if this just confirmed everything.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Besides,’ I said, ‘I’m entitled to. I saved your life, remember.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Pah!’ he said. ‘I never asked you to save me—to drag me here.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘You would have died without me,’ I said. ‘You would have died in quarter of an hour.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Ha!’ he said. ‘What a joke.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Okay, so what was <i>your</i> plan?’ I said. ‘Where were you off to that day, on your one leg, fainting every metre or two? Eh? Your kneecap swinging everywhere.’</p>

<p class="indent">Smith leaned out at me and pointed. ‘If you don’t leave me alone, I swear, I will kill you. I will slit your throat in your bed—you and your girl. I’ve done it before, and I’ll do it to you.’</p>

<p class="indent">Cold grabbed at my groin and began spreading. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I will gut you like an eel,’ he said. ‘I’ll feed you to the gulls.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘That’s very interesting, Smith, but what will you do then? Where will you go, out there?’ I jabbed my thumb at the outdoors, my voice quavery with fear. ‘Will you drive home, or will you fly? Maybe you’ll take a wheelchair? Do you know what century it is, out there? Do you know what a motorway is? A computer?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘You little fucker,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh, good plan,’ I said. ‘Do you even know where that is, by the way—your home? Is it still there?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Shut your trap,’ he said. ‘I’m not telling you, that’s for sure.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Because you don’t <i>know</i>,’ I said. ‘You don’t even know whether your home’s still there. You wouldn’t survive ten minutes out there, so don’t go playing the big man with me, Smith, you snake.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Pah!’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Who’s your wife, Smith? Do you have one? Have you <i>still</i> got one?’ </p>

<p class="indent">To this he ground his teeth and rolled away, really mad. In the first few days I’d asked him that question many times, though never so bluntly, and now I saw his nearest fist clench and unclench against the sheets, showing white round the knuckles. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m your only friend, Smith,’ I said. ‘I’m the only guy who helped you. And I haven’t told anyone about you, since then. I’ve kept my promise, even though you called me a liar. And thank you for that, by the way. Thank you for rubbing salt in that particular wound. I was good at it, Smith, my job. I got health information out to people, not all the time, but that was the basic idea. Not that you’d know anything about that—about public service. I know you’re a low-life. I know you stole from old ladies, back in Britain.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I did not.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘You did so. You were a thief and a cut-throat and a sneak. It’s so obvious. You probably knifed someone to run from your ship or camp or wherever you were when you deserted. You should be in jail. You were just lucky someone was kind to you when you washed up at Kāpiti. Which would be fine, if you didn’t lie about everything, didn’t pretend you were some big fighter all the time.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘What would you know about it?’ he said. ‘You’re a judgemental little coward.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘And you were lucky I found you, on the motorway. And before you ask, I don’t even want to know how you got there. I don’t care anymore.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He laughed. ‘As if I believe that.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I glared. ‘Do you want to know something, Smith?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh yes, I would,’ he said. ‘I’m enjoying this. I’d love to know.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Maybe I was interested in your story—maybe I am. But that’s not really the reason why I come here. I look out for you because I <i>saved</i> you. I’ve never done that before. And I think I did all right. I didn’t run away. I pulled finger when no one else would. I rescued you, Smith, and I’m bloody proud of it, too.’</p>

<p class="indent">Smith rolled his eyes. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Maybe I have been coming here for something, Smith,’ I said. ‘Maybe I’ve been waiting for you to say <i>thank you</i>. Do you know those words?’</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed. ‘There’s no way I’m thanking you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh, I know that,’ I said. ‘I know what you’re like now. But maybe I thought you would see past your own bullshit to see <i>me</i>. I’ve got no money coming in, Smith, and a bloody big mortgage. And my girlfriend’s having a breakdown because she can’t work, and she won’t even talk to me.’</p>

<p class="indent">Now he sighed up at the ceiling, pretending to be very bored. </p>

<p class="indent">‘But if you’re not interested, then screw you, Smith. You can just be some one-legged mess in a wheelchair for all I care. Go find your own way home. Go get your own car. If you’re not too afraid of <i>everything</i> out there, that is.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I was standing now, and I looked at the floor, amazed at how angry I was, at the blood throbbing in my face and my arms. ‘I wasn’t very good at my job, Smith—not like Mary. I was just okay, nothing more. But I didn’t deserve to get the chop, for Christ’s sake.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Why are you telling me this?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I don’t know. Because you annoy me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head, but he was facing away, and I knew I was getting through to him. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I really put myself out for you, Smith,’ I said. ‘And now you can’t even tell me what your wife’s name is, so that I can ring her and get her to collect you. You’re too scared to let me go, that’s your problem. You’re too scared that you won’t survive on your own without me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He was hunched away and I thought that maybe he really was afraid as well as mad, and now even that fed my anger. Somehow Smith had a unique ability to concentrate all my inchoate rage about everything. ‘Find your own way back, Smith,’ I said. ‘Just go home on your broken knee. Walk all the way, and see if I care.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I turned to collect my wallet and keys from the windowsill, and though I didn’t need to shift the chair I kicked it to the side anyway, just for the noise. </p>

<p class="indent">Smith made a sound, and when I whirled to face him I overbalanced, the blood rushing in my face. I was that overheated. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Hine,’ he said. ‘Her name is Hine.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘What?’ I said. ‘Whose?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘My wife,’ he said, his voice muffled against the bedding. ‘You can call her Hine.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I stood waiting for more. I tried to breathe slowly. ‘That’s not her real name, is it.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘You can call her that,’ he said. ‘She’s real. I have got one.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘How can I contact her? I don’t suppose she’s got a phone.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘You’d never find her,’ he said. ‘It’s impossible.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I breathed deep again. I saw an end to it all. With this information I could be rid of him. ‘I won’t hurt her, Smith. I won’t tell anyone. Just tell me how to find her. It’s only fair to her, and to me.’</p>

<p class="indent">Smith shook his head again. He was curled as best he could towards the window. ‘You’d never find it,’ he said. ‘And I don’t want you to meet her. You’re too hungry.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘What does that mean? I can help you.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘You want to know everything. You’re so greedy. You’d eat her up too.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘That’s not true.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘You’d better leave us alone,’ he said. ‘Leave me alone now.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I will,’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I mean it,’ he said. ‘Don’t come back here.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m going,’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Don’t come back,’ he said. ‘Actually, I need a nurse. Send a nurse up, on your way down. Then leave me alone.’ </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">It was two mornings after that. I was standing in the kitchen. I’d been out to the shed and fired up my job search and clicked on three remotely feasible job ideas, then closed my computer and come back inside, unable to deal. </p>

<p class="indent">I heard the door. It was Mary, coming back from the shop. She had the newspaper in her arms and some milk. Seeing me, she stood just inside the door. </p>

<p class="indent">‘What are you doing?’ she said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Nothing,’ I said. ‘Hi.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Right.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I was looking out the window at our barbecue table. My dad had built it a few summers before, when he’d come to stay. Mary moved to the fridge and I glanced at her shoulders as she bent to put the milk away and wondered how I could love her this much and piss her off this badly. How could this be my reward? Then she straightened and I resumed my stare out the window. </p>

<p class="indent">She smoothed her clothes down. ‘Are you doing anything today?’ </p>

<p class="indent">I shrugged. ‘What’s to do?’ </p>

<p class="indent">She stared. Don’t be like this, I told myself. Be better. </p>

<p class="indent">‘What about your friend?’ she said. ‘Are you going to see him?’</p>

<p class="indent">I shook my head. ‘He told me to leave him alone. He said he hates me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘You were kind of researching him,’ she said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘What does that mean?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘You know,’ she said. ‘Your history-researcher thing. You were doing the interview.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Sorry, you don’t know my ‘history-researcher thing’, Mary,’ I said. ‘You didn’t even know me at uni.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘You know what I mean,’ she said. ‘You know the interview.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I snorted. ‘And what’s wrong with that? What’s wrong with being interested?’</p>

<p class="indent">She arranged the paper on the table. ‘I’m just saying.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I was <i>helping</i> him,’ I said. ‘I took an interest, if that’s what you mean.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘You could call it that.’</p>

<p class="indent">I shook my head, bitterly this time. ‘No one else helped him, that day. <i>No one</i>. They all just drove past. I was the one who stopped and got the ambulance. I got his <i>blood</i> on me, for God’s sake. I’m the only one who helped him, and now when I go to visit him—the only person who visits him—all I get is criticism, from you and from him.’</p>

<p class="indent">Mary sighed and I glared out at the view of our barbecue table and the sky, hating it, hating our neighbour’s chimney as well. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Maybe you were smothering him a bit,’ she said. ‘You can do that, sometimes. You have that tendency.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Great,’ I said. ‘Thank you for that insight, Mary. Next time, I’ll just leave someone to bleed to death, just in case I smother them once they’re recuperating.’</p>

<p class="indent">Mary smoothed her clothes and exhaled again. ‘Pardon me for saying this David, and I’m saying it for both our sakes, but he’s kind of your only friend at the moment. It might pay to look after him.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘What am I supposed to do?’ I said. ‘He told me to leave him alone. He told me to never come back. That sounds pretty clear to me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Can someone else talk to him? Maybe I could?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘He’s got a wife,’ I said. ‘Apparently. Not that he trusted me with that information.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head quietly, as if I wasn’t trying, and I couldn’t look at her, holding it all in. Then she made to go down the hall and I whirled on her. </p>

<p class="indent">‘And how about you, Mary?’ I said. ‘Where have you gone, lately?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Pardon? Whoa, David. Calm down.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘No, you’re telling me not to abandon people. Hello? Haven’t you abandoned me?’</p>

<p class="indent">She stared, then gave an incredulous laugh, her hands up before her. ‘That’s a leap, David. You need to calm down.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘You’re not the only one who’s disestablished, okay?’ I said. ‘You’re not the only one who can’t find a job.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I never said that,’ she said. ‘I never said it’s not hard for you.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh, so that’s why you never talk to me. That’s why you look at me every morning—every single morning—like “Oh Christ, I woke up next to <i>that guy</i> again. That guy who isn’t trying, who never helps me.” That explains it, I suppose.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Her voice went quiet. ‘I’m not dealing with this very well. I know that. I don’t cope well when I’m not working.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Neither do I, okay? That’s what I’m saying. I’m—’ I shook my head. My face was hot with all the things I wanted to say. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I know,’ she said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘No, you don’t,’ I said. ‘You <i>don’t</i>. Work is not just important for you. It doesn’t start to matter only once you’ve got an MBA. You don’t know everything. You don’t.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She said nothing. Her head was down and I knew I was about to go too far, and I didn’t care. </p>

<p class="indent">‘It’s all about you, isn’t it, Mary. Your precious career. You’ve been selfish about this whole thing, right from the start—right from the start of <i>us</i>. Grade A selfish, that’s you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She didn’t look at me. She waited with her face averted until she was sure that I had finished, then reached to the table and rearranged the newspaper and the heap of gutted envelopes that lived there. Then she went back out the door to her car and drove away. </p>

<p class="noindent"/>

<p class="noindent">That afternoon I went down to the beach and threw sticks for the imaginary dog we’d never got around to buying. It always got rid of some venom, to hurl driftwood and watch him lumber after it into the waves. I’d missed him a lot lately, that nonexistent dog, happy and old, his warm head pushing against my hand. I threw him a dozen more sticks, then gave it up, turning to walk into the light southerly. </p>

<p class="indent">It was my favourite walk and it did me some good, because the wind was cool against my still-hot skin, but it was hard not to think about Mary. It was hard not to rehash that argument. It was difficult not to picture myself entering my forties without her, living in a separate house somewhere in Paraparaumu with my small car parked outside, still without a job. </p>

<p class="indent">A long boomerang of driftwood was anchored in the sand ahead of me and I sent it overarm towards the waves and watched the dog bound after it, and thought about heading back for the car, then decided to walk on. The coast cliffs above Paekākāriki looked steep and good and I pushed on towards them. </p>

<p class="indent">Again I wished I had my dad’s fencing ability, or some semi-trade skill like builder’s labouring to fall back on. He was a scientist now, but Dad had fenced his way all through university and overseas, and he could still flick up a fence for any of his neighbours any time. He’d even done a voluntary stint in Australia after the fires. I’d got my degree but never mastered anything else. I could do my job on the computers at work, and I could mow our lawns provided the mower started, and I could cycle to the railway station. That was about the extent of my skills. </p>

<p class="indent">I turned and headed back, trying to avoid looking across the water to Kāpiti. I found it strangely intimidating, that heavy collection of triangles angling into the sea. I had an irrational fear of its gravity, the way it drew your eye. I’d loved the stories about it, though. When I first arrived I’d read heaps of them. </p>

<p class="indent">I was nearly back at the carpark. I was back to missing Mary. I kicked a stray plastic bottle into the dune plants and missed her. I missed our imaginary dog. </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">I got the call to collect Smith from hospital on a Friday. Apparently mine was the only phone number the hospital had. He was in a different room, but he’d still managed to find a TV and turn it to a tremendous volume. His expression didn’t change when I arrived. I stood for some moments at the foot of his bed, waving my hands to demand his attention. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I thought you weren’t coming back,’ he said, at last.</p>

<p class="indent">‘I wasn’t,’ I said. ‘I’m here because of Mary. Besides, you’re leaving, aren’t you?’ </p>

<p class="indent">Smith continued to watch the television, the noise obliterating everything. </p>

<p class="indent">‘So,’ I said. ‘Are we going? Where’s your gear?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Wait,’ he said.</p>

<p class="indent">I sat down and tried to be patient. I could be rid of him by the end of the day, put the whole episode behind me. An old <i>Home Improvement</i> was on. Everybody had their shirts tucked in; they all looked well-fed and happy.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Smith?’ I said. ‘Are we going?’ </p>

<p class="indent">He smoothed his hair. ‘How is she?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘What?’ I said. ‘Who?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Mary,’ he said. ‘How is she?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Mary?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Āe. Your wāhine.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I laughed. ‘You’ve never asked about her before. Don’t pretend you care about Mary.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘It wasn’t my place,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">I laughed again. ‘Right.’</p>

<p class="indent">He glared. ‘I was trying not to be rude, Miller. It’s rude to ask questions like you do.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Sure,’ I said. ‘Are we going? I’d like to go soon, if that’s okay.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Wait a minute,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">I smoothed my hands on my thighs and tried to keep calm. </p>

<p class="indent">‘So how is she?’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘She’s not very well,’ I said. ‘She hasn’t been well for a while. I told you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Mitre 10 was advertising a special on water-blasters. Apparently Smith found it absorbing—but then the Briscoes lady came on, and he gave her equal attention. </p>

<p class="indent">‘You see,’ I said, ‘you don’t care at all. Don’t play games with me, please, Smith, especially not about Mary. I’m not in the mood.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Of course I heard you,’ he said. ‘I was waiting for you to go on.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I laughed. ‘You’re unbelievable.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘So go on, if you want to,’ he said. ‘Tell me about Mary.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Can we go after that?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Sure.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I smoothed my thighs again. ‘Like I told you, she’s lost her job,’ I said. ‘She can’t get another one, and she’s taking it very hard. It matters to her. She’s not very good, right now.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘What’s her trade?’ said Smith. </p>

<p class="indent">‘She’s a project manager. She works in government, mostly. She’s very good at it. She’s got an MBA. It means a lot to her. That’s why it’s so hard for her, now that she can’t get another job.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Plus it’s less money for both of you,’ said Smith. </p>

<p class="indent">I looked at him, surprised. ‘Yes. It’s less money coming in. We’ve got a mortgage, too.’</p>

<p class="indent">Smith was still looking at the television. ‘She really can’t get a job,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘She’s tried everything,’ I said. ‘It’s very tough out there, Smith. No one is recruiting. Everybody has to reapply for their own jobs. That doesn’t sound too tough, not compared to real unemployment, real poverty, but it’s hard on people. It’s hard on Mary. It hasn’t been good for our relationship. Not at all.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Smith smoothed his hair back and tried to bunch it. It was frizzy these days and seemed to be bothering him, and I wondered whether he usually wore it in a ponytail. I tried to remember what had been customary—what I’d read was customary—but gave up. It wasn’t clear what rules applied to him anyway. </p>

<p class="indent">‘And you can’t get a job, either,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I can’t,’ I said. ‘I’ve tried. There’s really nothing in my field.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘But it’s killing your marriage,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘It’s destroying it,’ I said, then stopped, remembering who I was talking to, how he might use anything against me. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Go on,’ he said. Again he said this without looking at me, as if, when he did, the spell would be broken. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Let’s go,’ I said. ‘Come on, Smith, we’re going.’ I didn’t stand up, though. </p>

<p class="indent">‘So she is down,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Very down. She’s in a bad way.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘So you have to get one,’ said Smith. ‘You have to get a job. You have to do it.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I snorted. ‘So I can be the breadwinner, I suppose. I’m the man, after all.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘No, Miller,’ he said. ‘You idiot.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Excuse me?’ </p>

<p class="indent">He heaved up in his bed but I didn’t flinch, this time. Something of his old threat had gone. There was a note of negotiation behind these questions. He’d realised again that he needed me. </p>

<p class="indent">‘You have to do it,’ he said. ‘You have to be the one.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Why me?’ I said. ‘Why should I have to get a job—from God knows where, by the way—when it’s just as hard for me? It doesn’t just have to be the man, anymore, Smith. That’s all changed.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘It’s got nothing to do with being the man. Your wife’s in trouble. You need money, and you’ve haven’t got any money, so get money. Stop complaining all the time, and do something.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘She’s not my wife,’ I said. ‘And it’s not my responsibility—not just mine. Mary gets paid more than me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Who cares?’ he said. ‘And don’t do it because it’s your responsibility. Do it to make life nicer for your wāhine, man. For Christ’s sake. How old are you, Miller? Do I have to tell you these things?’</p>

<p class="indent">I looked away from him. ‘It’s not that easy. Jobs are kind of specialised, these days, Smith. I’m kind of in a niche, you know.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Then you’re not trying hard enough,’ he said. ‘I bet there is something you could do, if you tried. You have to adapt, Miller. You have to think more.’ He laughed and shook his head sadly. ‘You might have had a fancy job in the government once, Miller, but you’re really still a baby.’</p>

<p class="indent">I stood up. ‘I think I might go.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Smith held his hands up, as if he had something to negotiate. In fact he had nothing to negotiate. Even so, he was smiling. ‘You can call me a rough-guts, Miller, if you want, and probably I am. I did some very bad things when I was young, back in Britain, and I know you’re just itching to know about them. But I did my time for them—I did a <i>bit</i> of time for them—and I’ll never tell anyone about them now.’ He eyed me. ‘Never—not anyone.’ </p>

<p class="indent">It was that old canny look, but I rolled my eyes, and he saw he couldn’t use that on me anymore. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Anyway,’ he said, ‘that’s not my point. The point is I’ve changed, and I know how to live quietly now. I’ve lived quietly with—with Hine for years now, ever since I arrived. And I’m good to her, Miller. That’s one thing I know. At least I look after her, and she looks after me. At least I’ve got the basic things down.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘So what about all those stories you told me? All that fighting?’</p>

<p class="indent">He waved this away. ‘You enjoyed them, didn’t you? You wanted to hear them.’</p>

<p class="indent">I laughed weakly and looked down. Then I brought out my car keys and rattled them, not very subtly, then realised he wouldn’t know what that signified. </p>

<p class="indent">‘You said Mary is Te Āti Awa, didn’t you,’ he said. ‘I knew some Te Āti Awa. I traded with them.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I said that’s part of her background,’ I said. ‘There’s German as well, even some Shetland. It’s all jumbled, just like mine.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Except yours is Pākehā.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘That’s right,’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">His reply was a long and rapid sentence in te reo that I couldn’t understand. </p>

<p class="indent">‘You know I can’t understand that,’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘You said you learnt Māori.’</p>

<p class="indent">I sighed. ‘I said that I’m <i>learning</i>, Smith. Don’t pretend. Lots of people are learning—I wasn’t boasting about that. And it’s only part-time, anyway. I told you that.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘So you’ve been learning a bit after work,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘That’s right,’ I said. ‘For a year and a bit, on and off.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘So you’ve learnt enough to know that you don’t know anything. All you’ve learnt is how ignorant you are.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘What is this, Smith?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Just answer my question.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Of course,’ I said. ‘Of course I barely know anything. Who cares? I’ve never claimed anything different. I never said I was fluent, Smith. Christ, I never will be. That’s not the point of learning. Will that be all, Smith?’ I said. ‘Can I go home now?’ </p>

<p class="indent">The bed-frame creaked as he eased his legs off it. Gingerly he put his feet on the floor, his hair falling round his face. ‘I’ll tell you what,’ he said. ‘I’ll show you my whare. I’ll let you meet my wife—I’ll let you meet Hine. But after that you have to promise not to try to find us again. You have to leave us alone. No more questions, no coming back for more. We’ll say goodbye, and then we’ll be finished, you and me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Whatever,’ I said. ‘You’re the boss, apparently.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘You have to promise,’ he said.</p>

<p class="indent">I laughed. ‘I really don’t care where you live, Smith. Not anymore. I want to go home. Can I go home now?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘So you’ll take me?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Yes, Smith. I said yes, didn’t I?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Promise,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh, for God’s sake! I just said I would take you. I don’t have to promise every five minutes, okay?’</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled. ‘Good, then. That’s settled.’</p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">There was barely room in the passenger’s side of my car for Smith and his braced leg, his crutches, the carrier bag of tape and replacement bandages. His weapons had been returned to him, still bundled in the big brown bag, and he held them all against his chest as we travelled, the musket-barrel angling across the ceiling. Traffic was busy in the city, but freed up once we hit the motorway, and Smith seemed comfortable enough, silently taking in the landscape of cars and satellite towns that whizzed by his window. Nothing seemed to surprise him now. </p>

<p class="indent">It was getting on for dusk, and we’d already hit Paekākāriki before he gave me any indication of directions, which he did with characteristic helpfulness, jabbing his thumb at the last minute towards a side-road that led into the swampland off the motorway, so I had to brake suddenly and turn. There was a gravel surface and it shushed and spat as we went through a low scrub of mānuka and harakeke, terminating at a carpark with signage for walkers and stiles leading to mown paths. </p>

<p class="indent">As soon as we stopped, Smith fought his door open and lurched towards a stile with his bag of weapons, his bad leg dragging. Locking the car, I followed with his crutches in my arms and the bandages hanging from my fingers, along with two bags of Four Square food that I’d thought he might be able to use, or might function as some sort of koha from me. Naturally Smith had given me no idea of what to expect at his home, or what was expected of me. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Smith,’ I said. ‘Wait.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Without looking back he lifted a hand to indicate he’d heard me, but didn’t stop, lurching on with surprising speed. </p>

<p class="indent">The track was dewy, sheltered on either side by high harakeke and toe-toe. A stream oozed on the right; far away, the motorway whizzed with cars. Every now and then bridges and gates led off into farmland, each gate hung with a sign forbidding entry, cows ambling behind them. It was just beyond one of these bridges that Smith pushed off the track and down into the harakeke. Angling my load of crutches and bags, I surged after him, the flax blading loudly against my ears. Through the other side there was a low bank, then the stream, which Smith sploshed directly into, mud and creek-algae smearing up the white of his bandages. Close to where he’d crossed, a thick log was laid across the stream. This, it seemed, was the usual crossing. Smith had not trusted his injured leg to the log. </p>

<p class="indent">Removing my jandals, I crossed the bridge, my load balanced in my arms. Smith was out the other side now, and he didn’t wait for me, plunging into yet more harakeke, the green closing around him. This time my bags tore as I pushed through, biscuits and bread spilling out crudely. </p>

<p class="indent">There seemed no end to the harakeke. Pushing blindly on I surged through it, fighting the restraining seed stalks, then tripped at last into a small clearing beneath a bank. Here a cooking fire burned, Smith standing before it. He was facing a woman who was dressed in a man’s shirt over a blanket similar to his own. Their faces were very close, and it seemed they’d just been kissing or whispering something. At my loud arrival they stepped back from each other. Smith pointed at the grass behind me—a bunch of bananas had fallen from my Four Square bags and glowed up from the grass. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Thank you,’ I said, retrieving them. The load in my arms was an embarrassment now, the food either torn and strewn in the flax or squashed under my arms. </p>

<p class="indent">Without speaking Smith left the woman and stooped into a whare that jutted from the bank, a makeshift A-frame roofed with raupō and two sheets of rusted tin held up by mānuka poles lashed together in threes. Further along the bank and around the clearing I could see no other buildings. Smith was all alone here with the woman tending the fire and its collection of beaten and dark pots. I assumed she was Hine. </p>

<p class="indent">Smith’s voice came indistinctly from inside the whare. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Pardon?’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Come in here,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">I came adjacent to the door, not peering in yet, looking instead for evidence that Smith had removed his shoes and left them outside. There was none, but I shucked off my jandals anyway and stooped under the door. With my burden of crutches and bags, my entry was complicated. </p>

<p class="indent">It was rather dark inside, light coming from stubs of candle on a legless table made of driftwood planks on the floor. Smith sat at the far end on a bed of mats against the wall. He indicated the fire outside, the woman working there. ‘Stay for a kai,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">Still standing with my load in my arms, I said thank you, and with my eyes tried to suggest he might introduce me to his partner before I sat down. Seeing this, he ignored me, instead laying each of his weapons out on the mat beside him, then lifted each in turn to hold it up to the light, checking for signs of damage or contamination. </p>

<p class="indent">He’d begun to oil his musket when the woman came inside. She looked me full in the face this time and smiled. She did not seem at all perturbed that I was there. I dumped the crutches and bags and straightened to greet her properly. She was clearly older than Smith. Black and grey hairs snaked up from her forehead and back from her ears. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m David,’ I said, and blushed at my English. I’d practised my te reo greetings many times, but couldn’t trust them now. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Tēnā koe, David,’ she said. The rest of her reply was too fast for me, but I did hear her give her name as Hine, and she smiled in Smith’s direction as she did so. </p>

<p class="indent">I glanced sharply at him. He had paused to watch our exchange, but his face betrayed nothing. He bent over the musket again, oiling its barrel. </p>

<p class="indent">Hine smiled again, but inclusively this time, and she took my hand and leaned in. Following her lead I shaped to hongi, then kissed her cheek instead. An aroma of perfume rose from her shirt, underlaid with a smell of cooking. She gave another fast but hospitable-sounding sentence in te reo, then invited me to sit on a mat against the wall. </p>

<p class="indent">I sat and she went to resume her cooking outside. I was embarrassed that I hadn’t mentioned my food, now piled with Smith’s crutches on the ground. It was obvious that there’d never be a good time to bring it up naturally. </p>

<p class="indent">Smith was no longer working on his weapons. He was looking out the door to watch Hine work over the food. He’d been away from her for many weeks now, and it showed in the reverent attention he paid to her movements above the fire. Even as I thought this he looked at me, then down at his hands, then out at Hine again. He didn’t venture any conversation, and while I sat waiting I found myself watching her too, though I tried to do it politely. </p>

<p class="indent">At length she came back in with a billy of tea and poured a tin mug for me, then lowered the remnants, billy and all, to the floor beside Smith. </p>

<p class="indent">I thanked her in English. </p>

<p class="indent">She nodded and said, ‘Āe,’ and went back outside. The largest of the pots was causing her difficulty. It seemed that whatever was in there was in danger of sticking to the bottom, and suddenly Smith leaned forward and sent a rapid string of advice out the door in Māori, and she nodded, adding a handful of something and stirring it in, and I wondered who normally did most of the cooking in their household. Again Smith saw me looking, and his eyes passed over mine impassively. </p>

<p class="indent">He waited until I had sipped my tea, then lifted his billy to his face and slurped his tea loudly, smiling to himself afterwards. He was goading me again, perhaps getting me back for his first vulnerability at the hospital. I had to say something. </p>

<p class="indent">‘So what will you do now?’ I said. ‘For work, I mean.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He shrugged. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Maybe I could help you,’ I said. ‘Help you find something. Things have changed a bit, out there.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Maybe,’ he said. ‘There’s no use for flax anymore, you said.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m sure there must be some kind of use for it,’ I said. ‘On a much smaller scale, though. Certainly there are no shiploads going to Sydney these days—not that I know of. I could find out for you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Smith watched Hine moving outside. At length he said, ‘What’s your trade again? Remind me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Health,’ I said. ‘Communications in health.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He indicated the crutches lying just along from me. ‘What could I get for those?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Nothing,’ I said. ‘Really they should go back to the hospital, when you’re done.’</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head. ‘Leave them here. Leave the bandages.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I laughed quietly. Ignoring this, he watched Hine again, scratching at the topmost bandage on his thigh. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Don’t tell anyone you came here,’ he said. ‘Don’t tell anyone where we are.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘I won’t,’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Swear on Mary’s life. I’m not joking, Miller.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘On Mary’s life,’ I said, wincing. </p>

<p class="indent">Easing his bad leg in front of him, its cocoon of bandaging, he nodded. </p>

<p class="indent">Now the food was ready. Hine brought it in wooden bowls, first to me, then to Smith. It was a thin sort of soup with joints of eel submerged and flaking in its depths. I was hungry and it smelled very good. It seemed we would eat inside. This surprised me. I also waited for someone to give some kind of karakia kai, but Smith’s head was bent over his food before Hine had even sat down. She lowered herself to a stack of hessian next to the fire, and I caught her smiling in the direction of Smith again—he was guzzling loudly—and knew I was being mocked somehow. She seemed to find it endearing, how much Smith was enjoying making me uncomfortable. I tried to make allowances for him. Nevertheless I remained with my bowl in my lap, waiting, and at last Hine said a few words in a blessing I’d never heard before, then gestured at my food to indicate that I should begin. </p>

<p class="indent">I began the meal politely, but it was good, if a little light on the salt. As I ate it came to me that it was now normal not to tell Mary I’d be eating elsewhere, and it saddened me. I thought of flipping out my phone to text her, and didn’t. I hoped she wasn’t worried. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Thank you for the food, Hine,’ I said. ‘It’s very good.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She met this with a smile, then returned to her own meal. Everything about her, about this place, made me feel coltish and uninitiated. She seemed someone of vast resources. She was altogether nicer than Smith, but already I could see she would be just as impervious to me as he had been, perhaps more so. Dipping a surreptitious finger in my food, I wondered about their relationship. I wondered what she made of Smith, his reduced circumstances, whether she’d thought of leaving him while he’d been away. </p>

<p class="indent">Smith barked into my thoughts. ‘Don’t think about us, Miller,’ he said. ‘You leave us alone, after this.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I nodded, blushing. </p>

<p class="indent">‘We’re all right,’ he said. ‘Me and Hine. Don’t you think about us anymore.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Again I nodded. I kept my eyes focused on the ground. </p>

<p class="indent">‘We’ll recover from this,’ he said. ‘My leg—we’ll recover. We’ll survive.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m sure you will,’ I said. ‘I’m sure you both will.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I felt more than saw him bend over his food again. Hine had not lifted her eyes. I finished my meal in silence, timing it to coincide with hers. Almost immediately, she was crossing the room, lifting away my bowl. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Thank you,’ I said. ‘It was very good.’</p>

<p class="indent">She went to Smith. As he handed up his bowl something passed between them, a murmured and coded endearment that I couldn’t hear, but which drew a smile from Hine, and as she straightened she lent her hand on his knee as if for balance but really for the contact, and he chucked her behind the ear, laughing. Then he offered up another sentence and she laughed and pushed his shoulder, the one that didn’t have the butterfly wound, mock-admonishing him in reply.</p>

<p class="indent">I stood and cleared my throat. ‘I’ll leave you now,’ I said. ‘Thank you again.’ </p>

<p class="indent">They looked at me as if surprised to find me still there, or by the sudden dimensions I had taken in the room. It was a moment before they said anything. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Don’t say thank you all the time,’ said Smith. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Pardon?’ </p>

<p class="indent">He wouldn’t meet my eye. Instead he looked beyond me to the dark rectangle of door. ‘Don’t say thank you all the time,’ he said. ‘You don’t have to.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Right,’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">He gave me a twisted sort of smile, and I realised I’d just received the closest thing I would get to a direct thank you from him. </p>

<p class="indent">Hine came across and took my hand. Again I was too embarrassed to mention the food I was leaving in the bags, and I soared with an absurd hope that she hadn’t seen them yet. She squeezed my hand, then stood back and nodded rather finally, and it was clear that she never expected to see me again. </p>

<p class="indent">I went to the door and gave a dorky little wave, then ducked out. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Wait,’ said Smith. He had one hand on the wall and another on the mat. Slowly he heaved himself up. It was painful to watch, but I didn’t go to him, and Hine didn’t either. She studied the floor instead, as if to watch him in this moment of debilitation would steal something important from him. </p>

<p class="indent">At last he was at the door, supporting himself on the door-poles. He poked his head out, looking round the clearing and then upstream. The light coming from behind him caught his hair, and I wondered what Hine would make of its new and shampooed bounce and smell. I hoped she would tease him. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Goodbye, Miller,’ he said. He extended his hand, and I took it. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Goodbye,’ I said. ‘Thank you.’</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head to remind me what he’d said about that. With his palm, he indicated the harakeke, the creek beyond it, the way home. </p>

<p class="noindent">The Starlet seemed oddly hollow on the remaining drive, a thin rattlebox that whined its small way up the motorway to Paraparaumu, then down the side-road to Paraparaumu Beach. The village was quiet and closed, Kāpiti Island sleeping on the water beyond the Parade. In the dark I trundled my car onto Wharemauku Road and parked behind Mary’s. </p>

<p class="indent">Inside, she was sitting with her knees up on the couch. Her laptop wasn’t on, not even open. She was watching an American show. She looked different in her face—something had gone from it. </p>

<p class="indent">‘How are you?’ I said, quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">She shrugged, and I wanted to sit beside her. </p>

<p class="indent">The show resumed and I stood there a moment longer, then went across, watching the TV without speaking. Not touching her yet. The house standing silent around us, all the rooms doused in the quiet that follows a big argument. </p>

<p class="indent">At length a commercial break came. ‘How was your friend?’ said Mary. </p>

<p class="indent">‘He gave me dinner,’ I said. ‘His wife did.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘That was good of them,’ she said. She was three-quarters facing away from me, watching advertisements for holidays we could no longer afford. She shifted and her hand brushed against mine, and I surged with a wave of hope and pain.</p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m going to retrain,’ she said, still not facing me. ‘I’ve decided.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Uh-huh,’ I said. </p>

<p class="indent">The show came back on and we watched it a little longer. A father was negotiating a crisis in the family home by running loudly up and down the stairs, reversing then reinstating his decisions about the children. The laugh track didn’t even annoy me.</p>

<p class="indent">‘What in?’ I said. ‘At uni?’</p>

<p class="indent">I felt Mary shrug, rather than saw her. ‘Who cares?’ she said. Then, more gently, ‘Anything. I don’t mind.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I squeezed her hand, then she took hers away, and we watched the show until it ended. Then Mary stood and went away to the shower and I wished that she’d kissed me before leaving, just pressed her lips to the skin below my eye. While the credits rolled I let the moisture of that imagined kiss slowly leave my cheekbone. Then I heard the shower come on and took a moment to duck out to my shed. </p>

<p class="indent">In the backyard the night was still and cool, sea sounds coming from just a few houses over. The dew had made the shed door sticky, and it made a tinny sound when I pushed in. </p>

<p class="indent">The lights took a while to warm up. I’d fitted energy-efficient bulbs and I was still getting used to them. Everything was in its place, though, if a little neglected. A book was propped open on my armchair, a mostly-drunk cup of tea on the table at the side. From my desk in the far corner my laptop showed its screen blackly. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Tomorrow,’ I said, pointing at it. ‘It starts tomorrow.’ </p>

<p class="indent">I was meaning my job search, because it was time I got back to it. But there was scarcely any evidence of it there. All that was spread over the bench and the spare seat was the Smith material, all my books and scribbled notes and theories. It shamed me to see its quantity, how much the project had enveloped me. All those notes I’d taken, all those stories and lies I’d listened to. You wanted to hear them, he’d said. You enjoyed them. </p>
