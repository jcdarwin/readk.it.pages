<title>THE PATHWAY</title>

        <div class="booksection">
          <h1>THE PATHWAY</h1>
<p class="noindent">It should have been a safe enough crossing. The Turakina had been swollen—not flooded, but swollen. It was easily fordable. Had Burtt not purchased a poor horse and ridden it bizarrely, he could have come across in perfect safety behind Marcus. Yet Burtt had done those things. He’d ridden a flighty horse in eccentric fashion, and accordingly he had been thrown. </p>

<p class="indent">Sitting upright in the night, alone in his asthmatic vigil, Marcus confronted these facts about his friend. It pained him to do so—it pained him to think poorly of a man so possessed of the true zeal—but he couldn’t sleep, and it hurt to breathe, and he couldn’t put the knowledge away from him any longer. Burtt had failed in the first practicality of ministering. He had failed to stay alive. </p>

<p class="milestone">*</p>

<p class="noindent">It had been raining all day. They’d left Te Awanui that morning and as they travelled the rain only intensified, beating and plucking at their hats and their hands where they held the reins. Marcus was in the lead, picking first along the trail on Pono, his large and implacable mission horse of these past several years, Burtt coming along behind. </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus was keen to get home. He’d been a fortnight at Te Awanui and even now as they rode the younger man was talking of the mission—his still-burgeoning congregation at the pā, the new church the people had built, and the kindness they’d shown his wife, who was again with child. He was full of the fruits of the Lord’s work, and Marcus was pleased for him, but in the past weeks he’d heard a lot about Te Awanui. Subtly he urged Pono forward, not out of hearing range but almost, so he could still hear Burtt and respond when required, but savour as well the flick of wet mānuka against his hands as he went through, the high silence of the leaking sky. </p>

<p class="indent">No one seemed to have travelled their way that morning and Marcus was first down the path that led to the Turakina. He found its surface brown and high and circling. In a moment Burtt came down the bank too and reined in, the river’s bulk forcing him quiet. In the rain they faced it, Marcus on his larger horse, the smaller man beside him, rain dripping from their hat-brims. </p>

<p class="indent">‘What do you think, Reverend?’ said Burtt. ‘Is it fordable? I didn’t think it would be this high.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Certainly it can be crossed,’ said Marcus. </p>

<p class="indent">Burtt fell silent, and Marcus let it stretch out for a time. Burtt had been in the colony three years now, but was still his junior in most things. </p>

<p class="indent">‘We could ford it here,’ said Marcus, ‘but these are shifting sands. It would be easy to bog the horses.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Yes,’ said Burtt. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I saw a man get stuck badly here, once,’ said Marcus. ‘It took some work to free him.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Burtt said nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">‘I think we would be better at the river mouth,’ said Marcus. ‘Are you confident of crossing, John?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Absolutely,’ said Burtt. ‘But we would be in deeper water, at the mouth. It would be tidal water, too.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘That is true,’ said Marcus. </p>

<p class="indent">They surveyed the river again. There were no branches or trees coming down—it was not that flooded. It was only swollen, but it was a difficult river in the best of conditions, and it would be a demanding swim for the horses, and there was the quicksand. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I think we should try here,’ said Burtt. ‘It might not be as bad as we think. Let me try.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Allow me,’ said Marcus. ‘I’ll go on Pono. He has the experience. He won’t panic, should the riverbed be sticky.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Burtt nodded and eased back. </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus paused to ready Pono, then kneed him forward. There was a bank before the shallows, then the main bulk of water, and the big horse went in willingly—he was a strong swimmer; if it could be crossed, Pono would ford it—but no sooner were they in the shallows than he sank almost to his belly, water climbing up Marcus’s legs while the horse laboured to pull free and turn around. A long moment of sloshing followed, Pono snorting with the effort of fighting the sand and turning free; then they were pulling back up the bank, water streaming from Pono’s legs and down. </p>

<p class="indent">‘We’ll have to try the mouth,’ said Marcus. ‘It’s not possible here.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Have you crossed there before?’ said Burtt. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I have,’ said Marcus. ‘How’s your horse in swimming? I trust he is sturdy.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘He’ll be good for it,’ said Burtt. ‘He’s a fine river-horse now. We’ve had a lot of practice.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus did not look at the horse beneath Burtt for fear he might betray his misgivings about it. He didn’t trust the creature, but he hadn’t been there at the purchase, and Burtt had to be free to make his own decisions. ‘Let’s move on then,’ he said. ‘It is raining.’</p>

<p class="indent">And so they turned and tracked downstream with Marcus in the lead, rain drumming on the two men and their horses, the Turakina sliding thickly by beside them. Marcus was keen to get through. A tremendous load of work awaited him at his own mission, and after another hour or two along the way towards Ōtaki, Burtt would turn round to make Te Awanui by nightfall, and from there the remainder of the day’s riding would be left to Marcus to complete on his own. </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">At the mouth the noise was considerable. The river was high and turbulent where it met the incoming tide, and the surf beyond made a pouring noise. The footing seemed safer, though, the sand beaten to a firm bank by the years. It would be a stern swim for the horses, nothing more. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Are you ready, John?’ said Marcus. The surf and rain made his voice small, so he said it again, for the certainty. ‘Are you ready, John?’ </p>

<p class="indent">Burtt looked at the river and nodded firmly. ‘I am.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Straight on, then. Stay close to Pono—he’s been through before. What are you doing, John?’ </p>

<p class="indent">Burtt had lifted out of his stirrups and was kneeling on top of his saddle. All his weight was balanced on his knees up there. </p>

<p class="indent">‘What are you doing, John?’ said Marcus. ‘Why are you seated that way?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m ready,’ said Burtt. ‘I’ll cross this way.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I would not attempt that, John. It’s not safe. You should remain in the saddle. It’s not safe up there.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘This is the way I do it now,’ said Burtt. ‘Pegasus and I—we cross this way.’</p>

<p class="indent">The reins were too tight, gripped hard so Burtt could maintain his kneeling balance, and now—as if on cue—the horse pranced and threw its head. The bit was pulled too severely; the horse’s jaw stood out while he snorted and danced. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I must counsel against that,’ said Marcus, when the horse had settled. ‘It’s too dangerous. You need more control—particularly in these waters, John. You can see that the river is swollen.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘This is the way I cross,’ said Burtt. ‘I do it this way, now.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Why?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘It keeps me dry,’ said Burtt. ‘I can’t get wet.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Pardon?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I can’t get wet,’ said Burtt. ‘I remain dry this way.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus considered the rain falling on them, falling on everything. He waited for Burtt to consider it too. When he didn’t, Marcus said, ‘But you are already wet, John. We both are—the rain.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Burtt’s face closed. ‘I’ll cross this way.’</p>

<p class="indent">Marcus adjusted the lie of his own reins. He did not want to harangue Burtt, but neither could he allow him to attempt such a crossing. ‘Are you concerned that, should you get wet, you’ll fall ill? Is that your fear?’ </p>

<p class="indent">The younger man did not reply. Instead he held the reins too tight, forcing the horse to toss his head again, and fixed his attention on the river in front of him. </p>

<p class="indent">‘If you are worried about getting wet and falling ill, we could dry off on the other side, John,’ said Marcus. ‘We could build a fire and dry our clothes before we move on. Lord knows I, of all people, would not wish illness on anyone.’</p>

<p class="indent">Burtt did not smile at the reference. Scarcely anyone on the coast was unaware of Marcus’s asthma or its tendency to debilitate him, but Burtt gave no sign of that now. He simply shook his head and grew more determined. To save him, Marcus glanced away. Perhaps the man was concerned for Mrs Burtt. Perhaps he did not want to fall ill with a child expected. It was a fair concern—they’d lost two already, Marcus knew, one before birth and one shortly after—but it was clouding his judgement. </p>

<p class="indent">As if he’d heard his thoughts, Burtt glanced sharply at him. ‘I am ready, Reverend,’ he said. ‘This is the way we cross now, Pegasus and I. We’ve crossed many rivers this way.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Be careful, then,’ said Marcus. ‘I don’t like it. I don’t like the way you’re mounted, but I trust you. I trust your judgement, John.’</p>

<p class="indent">Burtt nodded and adjusted his kneeling position.</p>

<p class="indent">Marcus brought Pono alongside, in order that he might calm the smaller horse. </p>

<p class="indent">‘We should come out near that point there,’ he said, pointing. ‘We’ll be carried a short way, I expect, but I doubt we’ll go much past there.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I agree.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Very well,’ said Marcus. ‘Straight on.’</p>

<p class="indent">The first few yards were straightforward, Pono’s hooves firm on the river floor while the water pushed coldly at Marcus’s trousers and into his boots. Then the depth increased suddenly and the current shoved from the side, and Pono’s legs began to beat out in front, and Marcus leaned up with the reins knotted loose in his mane, encouraging him. They were making downstream, the bank sliding by on the far side, but not enough to concern him. Even in this current Pono was strong underneath him. Marcus winced as the water stole higher and clutched through his trousers at his groin. </p>

<p class="indent">Then Burtt made a sound and Marcus turned. Burtt’s horse was well back and its head was up—he’d reared. Burtt was off the horse and falling sideways. </p>

<p class="indent">‘John!’</p>

<p class="indent">From his horse Burtt fell slowly and unresistingly as if into a bed, and just as gently the water closed brownly over him. It removed his hat and circled it lazily downstream to bump and eddy on the surface. No hand came up, no sign of swimming struggle. Burtt’s horse turned and began swimming back towards the bank, abandoning him. </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus scanned the water but saw nothing; then Burtt rolled up, plastered with wet and insensible. His face looked slack, as if he’d been knocked unconscious. Instantly Marcus reached out towards him, but Burtt was too far away and being carried further. Marcus turned Pono and began back towards the main bank. Soon they were in the shallows and Marcus leapt from the saddle and buckled as soon as he hit the sand, the weight of his clothes and coat crushing him. </p>

<p class="indent">Lying on his side there he glimpsed two lads near the scrub. They must have been watching. He stood and tore at the buttons and fabric of his coat which, sodden, would not cooperate with his cold fingers. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Āwhina mai!’ said Marcus. </p>

<p class="indent">But they were just lads. When he beckoned and shouted they hedged back. He gave up on them and tore his coat away and wrenched at the laces of his boots, then broke the laces and kicked them free. </p>

<p class="indent">Then he ran to the water and surged in. It was soon to his thighs, then it was carrying him. He struck out with his arms and was taken downstream. The water was all round him to his chin, the bank moving fast beyond. He tried to remain upright by treading water, and was turned and carried further. Across the surface he saw Burtt’s body roll to the surface and sink again. He ducked his head and swam towards him, the current pushing loudly over his ears. He collided with Burtt. He caught him under the arm and dragged him above water—and there was nothing in the face of his friend. His eyes were open but there was no sign. Holding him by the armpits Marcus slapped his face and the head swayed to the side and they turned again in the current and were carried further, as if partnered in some horrid dance. </p>

<p class="indent">‘John!’</p>

<p class="indent">There was nothing. It was impossible. John had lost consciousness so quickly. A wave eased over and swamped them both lazily and when Marcus spat it was salt water. He tried to touch the bottom and sank instead, Burtt’s weight pushing him down. He resisted and tried to kick up; he held Burtt by the armpits and the weight pulled down with astonishing force, and he heard himself say, Lord. Help. </p>

<p class="indent">They rose to the surface and another wave came and the undertow of it sucked and teased at his grip on Burtt, and then the next wave took him away. Marcus felt the body leave his hands, felt the graze of Burtt’s coat as he scrabbled for it with his fingers. Then they were separated. Marcus sensed him suspended somewhere behind, a dark shape hanging a few feet down, but when he dove and swam deeper and groped out in the murk he found nothing. He looked towards the shore and it was far away. There was nothing he could recognise—not the horses, not the boys—and with the water massaging his chin he sploshed with his arms and felt a sucking cold dread.</p>

<p class="indent">He was struggling just to stay above water. He had no strength left; he had to leave Burtt. Deliver him, O Lord. Deliver Burtt. He kicked out to swim towards the shore, but the undertow eased him back effortlessly. He pulled feebly with his arms and they had no power and he panicked blindly, thrashing—the sea wanted him; it was pulling him—and then he was in the shallows. He tried to walk from the water and fell instead and lay there until the sensation of water sneaking cold in his topmost ear-canal stirred him. He struggled to stand again and water streamed from his sodden clothes as he walked, and he fell on the sand. </p>

<p class="indent">The boys came. He tried to lift his head but vomited instead, bile stinging distantly from his mouth and drooling into the sand. The boys went away and came back with blankets from somewhere. They lowered them towards him. </p>

<p class="indent">With an effort he lifted to a sitting position and looked around. There was no one else, just the boys. He couldn’t speak yet through his numbed lips but with his hands he indicated that they should help him remove his wet clothes. It was a slow process, his fingers unworkable in the cold, and shaking. Finally the clothes were off and he wrapped himself again in the blankets and sat while the boys built a fire as the rain eased. </p>

<p class="indent">They quickly had a spark and fed the fire until it was blazing, one boy tending it while the other ran to the scrub and dragged back fuel. They were industrious now that they had a clear plan. The larger boy propped the wet clothes on sticks to dry them. Soon Marcus could work his mouth into sentences, and he thanked them in chattering half-sentences for the fire. They both froze while he spoke—perhaps they knew who he was, perhaps they’d seen him with Burtt, or perhaps his accent wasn’t clear to them. </p>

<p class="indent">The older boy worked up to a question. His first attempt was a murmur that Marcus couldn’t catch properly.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Āno?’ said Marcus.</p>

<p class="indent">This time the smaller boy spoke loudly. He was asking if they should fetch his horse for him, and he made the gestures of a man riding, the reins held out before him, his face serious. He could not have been more than ten.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Āe,’ said Marcus. ‘Ko Pono tāna ingoa—Pono.’ </p>

<p class="indent">They ran off and he hunkered in the blankets before the fire, his hands held towards it, working to get warm. Already his breathing had tightened—asthma, his old adversary, returning with the long fight in the water, the cold that had wrapped round his lungs. He stared at the fire and concentrated only on that, on getting warm. He would wait until his shivering had stopped and his clothes dried before riding back for Te Awanui. To ride before he was warm would only bring on severe asthma and halt him half an hour up the trail. </p>

<p class="indent">He kept his eyes on the fire. Once only he turned to look out towards the river mouth and the sea and pray that somehow Burtt might survive, at the same time dreading that what he knew—what he’d seen—was inevitable. Then he hoped that at least the sea would bring in Burtt’s body. It would be much better if the body came in. He trusted it would. It might take days, but it would come in. </p>

<p class="indent">He turned back to the flames. He shifted his clothes on their propped sticks to put them nearer the drying heat and rubbed his hands together to get their feeling back, to get himself usefully warm. </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">The boys returned with Pono and, much later, with Pegasus. The latter horse, it seemed, had bolted some distance. Watching Marcus gravely, the boys stood with the reins in their hands, awaiting his instructions. They were like any young boys anywhere, deferring to someone older in the face of a disaster that awed them. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Ka pai,’ said Marcus. ‘Thank you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Silently they took this in. They stared and did not come any closer. </p>

<p class="indent">He thanked them again and said they could go, then sank back against the logs they’d propped behind him. He closed his eyes. </p>

<p class="indent">When he woke the boys had been replaced by two young men who stood almost in the same position, watching him. He greeted them without getting to his feet, pausing according to the demands of his breathing. They averted their eyes while he collected his clothes and dressed. His clothes were mostly dry, the boots squelchy but serviceable. </p>

<p class="indent">He addressed them again, and they knew already—the Reverend was lost out there, drowned—but they let him explain where Burtt might be, let him gesture towards the deepest place of the river-mouth, the sea. The Reverend was lost out there, he said. He could not be brought in. Nobody should attempt to bring him in—only the sea could do it. Only the sea. It was too dangerous for men. </p>

<p class="indent">They waited until he had finished speaking. Then they helped him remount Pono. He offered them Pegasus but they refused, so he secured the spare horse to his own and began the ride back towards Te Awanui. Pono was rested now and went along eagerly. The rain had ceased and there was no wind, and Marcus was grateful for the respite, as it made the going easier for him, for his breathing, and for the two young men who ran at his side. </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">It was a ride of about twenty miles. The young men ran with him until about halfway; then Marcus stopped and prevailed upon them to return. They were reluctant but he urged them. He was within safe distance of Te Awanui now, and for his sake they should return to their homes and spread word that he was alive. More than once a report of his own death had been allowed to travel the coast and he’d returned to widespread consternation at Ōtaki and Waikanae. The pair submitted at last and he thanked them and waited until they had run out of sight towards the Turakina. </p>

<p class="indent">Then he turned and gave Pono the way, Burtt’s horse trailing behind. It was hard not to despise the creature. In his work a missionary required few material things, but trust in his travelling equipment was one of them. A horse that could not be relied upon reduced a man’s capacity to serve in the Lord, and this horse of Burtt’s—Marcus put it out of his mind. </p>

<p class="indent">His priority was to reach Te Awanui. By the grace of God and his own industry Burtt had baptised more than eight hundred of the Māori people of the area, drawn from the pā and the places beyond. It was a credit to him. It would be his legacy, but so would the uncertainty and grief among the congregation that would entail upon his death now, and to assuage it would be Marcus’s work. He would have Burtt’s teachers to support too—and there would be Mrs Burtt. </p>

<p class="indent">He rode on and the day drew down and his asthma steadily worsened, his breathing becoming very noisy and rasping. It would be difficult to sleep tonight, but at least he would sleep warm at the pā. The people there had always sheltered him well. He’d baptised a number there before Burtt came, and many he still counted as dear friends, and all were familiar with the trials of his asthma—more than once he’d been laid low at the pā and aided back to health there. He would forever be grateful. </p>

<p class="indent">He kept his mind on these things, on the thankfulness he owed to the people and to his God, to the Love he could never hope to redeem. He gave Pono the trail and held the reins loose and swayed with his movement through the scrub, recounting these mercies, recounting that old pathway of prayer. </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">As he neared Te Awanui he was met again and escorted. The news of his coming had travelled swiftly. Once within the pā he went directly towards Burtt’s mission whare. It was a squat but long building with raupō roofing and tekoteko, made dark by the angled light of the afternoon. He halloed it while still mounted, but no answer came from within. </p>

<p class="indent">He dismounted and tethered the horses. He did not unsaddle or water them. Then he walked from the horses towards the whare and someone came from it—it was Mrs Burtt, and her hand flew to her mouth, then down. It was her husband’s tethered horse, it seemed, that had done it. Riderless and entire at the fence, it confirmed something unbelieved until now. </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus tried not to watch as she recovered, smoothing her hands over her face as if washing it without water, then smoothing them on her clothes. Coming close under the low roof he heard the wheeze of his own breathing as he faced her. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Mrs Burtt,’ he said. </p>

<p class="indent">She flinched. She had a hand on a pole that held up the roof.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Mrs Burtt, I am very sorry,’ he said. ‘You have heard, I presume.’</p>

<p class="indent">She nodded, and it was hard; he looked away. Beyond the straggly foreyard he could see the other buildings of the pā, and the new church that John and the people had built, splendid in its new timber and catching the sun. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Mrs Burtt, I am very sorry,’ he said. ‘I tried to bring John from the water but I couldn’t. I am very sorry. You know he was a dear friend to me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She tried to smile, and he was grateful for her bravery. Lift her up, Lord. Give her the strength—strengthen her. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I am sorry I couldn’t bring him to you,’ he said. ‘I wanted above all to return him to you. I wanted to bring him back to this place—to his mission.’</p>

<p class="indent">She nodded again. She was brave but he feared for her spirits. She would be alone now in the pā with her sorrow and her unborn child. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Reverend Burtt is with the Lord now,’ said Marcus. ‘We remember he has gone to God. We remember to rejoice for him.’</p>

<p class="indent">At this, her face hardened—then she dropped her eyes to her hands. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I will be here overnight, and for as long as required,’ he said. ‘I will go about the people. I will be just up the pā, should you need me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She worked the thumb of one hand over the knuckles of the other. </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus rasped a deep breath in. ‘I will see to our horses now. I will send for Mrs Williams.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She nodded again, then turned and went inside speedily, as if she would soon lose composure. Suddenly alone, Marcus remained there near the door a moment longer, then went towards the horses. His boots were still damp with river-water and he was conscious as he walked in the yard of the loud squelch they made. </p>

<p class="indent">He could have asked any lad of the pā to help him unsaddle the horses, but he chose to do it alone. He removed the saddle that was cinched around Pegasus, and the saddle blanket, and put them with the bridle on the veranda. Then he came to Pono; the great horse nickered and nosed him, then shivered as the saddle was removed. Marcus moved his hands over him, brushing and warming him with the saddle blanket. Then he removed the bridle and Pono remained still until he was a safe distance away, then shook his head and mane, happy in his loyal way to be freed of the restraining bit, the water-stained reins. </p>

<p class="spacer"/>

<p class="noindent">For the remainder of the afternoon Marcus left Mrs Burtt to herself and went about the pā. There was considerable distress among the people at the loss of their Reverend. With the assistance of Burtt’s teachers he attempted to relieve it. He gave advice about how Mrs Burtt might best be supported, and asked some women of the pā to call on her. Some people from the new Pākehā settlement might come, but most succour, he knew, would come from these women of the pā, Christian women whom Mrs Burtt had taught and befriended through her school, and whom Reverend Burtt had baptised. </p>

<p class="indent">It was long past dusk when he returned to the mission whare. Light was flickering through the gaps in the walls. He stepped loudly on the boards and knocked on the doorpost to announce himself, then went inside. A lantern on a table made of boxes threw a sphere of light, beyond which Mrs Burtt sat on the low bed of mats and blankets. In the darkness it was difficult to make out her features. He glanced over the rest of the whare. The fire was cold, and no one was with her. It was irregular—perhaps, he thought, they’d come and she had sent them away. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I have sent for Mrs Williams,’ he said. ‘I trust she will arrive soon.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He saw the movement of her outline as she nodded, then she propped herself on one hand to stand up, and he couldn’t watch, a wave of unhappiness going through him. Only two days before she’d risen in just this way when he’d come in with Burtt in search of refreshment, having travelled down the river that day. This was too much. He wasn’t equipped to deal with Mrs Burtt. He wasn’t able. Slow in her pregnant condition, she came towards him. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Have you found somewhere to sleep, Reverend?’ she said.</p>

<p class="indent">‘I am very sorry, Mrs Burtt,’ he said. ‘You must know I feel your loss keenly. Lord knows I valued John tremendously. He was a brother in Christ—and a true friend. I admired him. He has performed such excellent work here. You both have.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She said nothing. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m sorry I couldn’t bring John from the water,’ he said. ‘I swam to him but I couldn’t bring him in. He was—’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Please go on, Reverend,’ she said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘The river was not unduly flooded,’ he said. ‘We could have got across safely, but it didn’t go well, and once John fell in, the current was very strong. If only he—perhaps if I—’ </p>

<p class="indent">Mrs Burtt gestured at the table. ‘Would you like to sit with me, Reverend? Would you mind?’</p>

<p class="indent">They sat opposite each other on stools and he put his hands on the table, then underneath it. His fingers had the washed and white pallor that followed a prolonged swim, and he didn’t want her to see them. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I will light the fire,’ he said. ‘You will need a fire, shortly.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Please don’t do that, Reverend.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He went to it anyway. There were some still-glowing embers, and some kindling stacked at the side, and he broke it small, then built on larger pieces. Blowing on the coals forced a cough from him but he persisted and soon had the flames fanning up to catch the tinder and spread. This small achievement cheered him, but even as he worked there, crouched inelegantly before the fire, he was conscious of Mrs Burtt at the table, watching him. </p>

<p class="indent">‘May I ask you something, Reverend?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Of course,’ he said, but he remained at the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">‘You were describing how it happened, sir,’ she said. ‘I still don’t have it clear.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus poked about in the fire, turning unburned wood into the flames. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m sorry,’ she said. ‘Perhaps it is hard for you. But it seems so strange.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus put down the poker and straightened. He brushed his clothes. The odour of river-mud was in them. He hoped the smell wouldn’t reach her as he warmed up with the room.</p>

<p class="indent">‘It would help me sir, if you could tell me.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m afraid Reverend Burtt had a poor horse,’ said Marcus. ‘I’m afraid—at least this morning, his horse was poor.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘His horse?’ she said. ‘Pegasus?’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Yes,’ said Marcus.</p>

<p class="indent">She watched him, and he came to the table and sat down—and again put his hands below the table. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Perhaps he’s not a poor horse,’ he said. ‘Perhaps that is too strong. But he did not serve John well today.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘The river was flooded, I heard.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘It was not in flood. It was swollen. We had both crossed rivers in worse condition. John’s horse let him down. It pains me to say it, Mrs Burtt, but that is how I observed it. I’m afraid that horse was not a wise purchase. The man who sold it to your husband should not have done so—not when he knew John was a new missionary and would need a horse he could rely on. It was not Christian.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘Are you sure it was Pegasus?’ said Mrs Burtt. ‘He has not given us trouble before. John loved Pegasus. He valued him.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘That is something,’ said Marcus. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I find it hard to credit that it was Pegasus,’ said Mrs Burtt.</p>

<p class="indent">Marcus paused. ‘Perhaps there was a bad current. Perhaps a current caught Pegasus and John in a way it did not catch Pono and me. It was not too flooded to cross, though.’ He looked away. She could see in his face that he had more to say, and he was not willing to give it to her. He would not discuss John’s bizarre manner of riding with her.</p>

<p class="indent">‘I have been about the pā, Mrs Burtt,’ he said. ‘I have been among John’s congregation. All of the people are distressed. They are very sad at his passing. They share your sorrow.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She nodded, tolerating this diversion. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I share their pain,’ he said. ‘But I know I need to offer you no consolation. I know your faith has taught you—’ </p>

<p class="indent">She huffed, and Marcus stared at her. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Our brother is in the better place,’ he said. ‘We rejoice for him—we remember to rejoice, because tonight he walks in the Kingdom of Glory.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Mrs Burtt turned a sour expression at the wall. </p>

<p class="indent">‘We have suffered a severe loss,’ said Marcus. ‘You and I, and all of John’s people. We all feel it keenly. I feel it especially. I have lost a brother in the Lord; I have lost my fellow labourer and my friend.’ He swallowed. ‘But I remember that what I feel as a loss to me is a gain for John, for he goes to the Kingdom of Glory, and therefore I rejoice. Oh that we may follow him—may we both join him, when the time comes.’</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs Burtt didn’t move or speak but he knew that she wished to deny this. It was in her body; it was in her hard face. She did not want to acknowledge the consolation. </p>

<p class="indent">‘We are lifted up in the Lord, Mrs Burtt. We rejoice in His plan.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Now she looked him in the face and spoke as if irritated and bored. ‘But it is so hard to see it, isn’t it, sir. It is so hard to see. All we have done—all John has done. All that has been asked of us, and all that he’s given.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Yes, and he has given—’</p>

<p class="indent">‘John has given everything of us,’ she said. ‘There is nothing of us remaining.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘It is true that John was blessed with the true zeal.’</p>

<p class="indent">She waved this away. ‘Our life is all for the mission. It is all for the mission and the travelling, the interruption. We are plagued by interruption, Reverend. We never have a moment to ourselves. Everything he does—everything he did—it is all for the Lord and the salvation of the people, and now he is drowned.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘John would ask us to rejoice, Mrs Burtt,’ he said. ‘I know that is what John would want.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Oh, what John would want,’ she said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘I beg your pardon?’</p>

<p class="indent">‘What John would want,’ she said, plainly. </p>

<p class="indent">Somehow Marcus was standing. His face was hot and so were his palms. ‘I’m afraid I don’t understand you.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I’m saying, <i>What John would want</i>.’ She cast an unfavourable look about the whare. ‘He would want this, I suppose. All of it—exactly this.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘You are not yourself, Mrs Burtt,’ he said. ‘I should leave you. You need rest.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I have rested all afternoon. I have lain—’ she jerked a thumb at it ‘—on those blankets. If you can call that rest, I have rested.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘You have suffered a great blow,’ he said. ‘You have my sympathy. But the Lord lifts us up, Mrs Burtt. John has gone to God and we rejoice in the divine appointment. We must acquiesce to his will. I know your faith has taught you to seek all the consolation you might need in a covenant God.’</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long silence in which the fire crackled and Marcus’s quickened breaths wheezed. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Do you really think so, sir,’ she said. ‘Do you honestly.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I do,’ said Marcus. ‘And I know you do too. Although it is hard.’</p>

<p class="indent">She turned to look at the fire a long moment. ‘I am with child, Reverend. It is my third time.’</p>

<p class="indent">Marcus went to say something, but didn’t. He followed her eye to the fire and drew no peace from its flames. He wished he was somewhere outside, far away. She was too much for him. She was older than him, and beyond him. </p>

<p class="indent">Finally she gave a great sigh. ‘I apologise, Reverend. You are right, sir. I am not myself.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘You have my sympathy.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She let another silence work in, then said, ‘My faith does not waver, Reverend.’ She had the sound of an older sister agreeing to play a childish game. </p>

<p class="indent">‘You are constant in your true love of the Lord,’ said Marcus. ‘I know you are firm.’ </p>

<p class="indent">She gave a tolerant nod. </p>

<p class="indent">‘It is a blow,’ he said, ‘it is sudden. But the Lord asks from us, and we—’</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs Burtt laughed. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Good Lord,’ said Marcus. ‘Mrs Burtt.’</p>

<p class="indent">She continued to laugh for what seemed a long time. Then she wiped her eyes. ‘You are right in that, sir—that is one thing you are right about. It is a shock. It certainly is sudden.’ And she laughed again and sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">‘I will read to you from the Book, Mrs Burtt,’ he said. ‘I will bring you the comfort the Word brings.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I apologise, Reverend,’ she said. ‘I am not myself. Thank you for sitting with me. Thank you for lighting the fire.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘We will sit again,’ he said. ‘Let us sit at the table.’</p>

<p class="indent">He found her a stool and she brought her hands before her and he reached to his coat and brought out the Book and flipped through the pages unseeing, his hands shaking at her nerve, at her trouble, and it was not until he’d flipped many pages and found the passage he wanted that he realised it was <i>Te Paipera Tapu</i> he held, that he’d left his English copy with a friend up the pā. He glanced at Mrs Burtt, who had bent her head now in a seemly fashion, and decided to read from it anyway. She was as fluent now as Burtt had been and had taught in this tongue and surely it would comfort her just the same to be read to in the Word of her hosts, to be reminded of the nature of John’s appointment and of the great many around her whom he’d brought to God, and who had sheltered her and Burtt throughout their time here. </p>

<p class="indent">And now just to look again for the precise words he’d intended brought him comfort, to leaf through the pages and watch the Word column and column before him. And at last he found the passage and sent the gospel across the table to her, his hands firm now about the margins, his voice steadying, and he knew the relief she was receiving from it, the rhythmical endless rightness of the sounds, the brave eternal truths of the words. </p>

<p class="milestone">*</p>

<p class="noindent">Marcus jerked awake and coughed, gasped with a constricted wheeze. His breath caught and came as through a thicket, whistling. And with each gasp a cough tickled in his chest, and to suppress the cough made him sweat. In the half-light across the whare he could see the outline of his friend Ruka under a blanket sleeping soundly. He was one of Burtt’s teachers and had accompanied Marcus throughout his rounds that day, and ridden up the river to fetch a fellow teacher who’d been away. Having opened his whare to Marcus he was now enjoying the sleep he deserved. </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus had no wish to wake him, but the discomfort of suppressing the cough was considerable. Slowly he pulled himself upright to sit against the wall and wait for his breathing to plateau. It hurt just to breathe, and he got hardly any air in, and he could move only very slowly, so starved were his muscles of air, but he did not panic. It was about two or three in the morning, he judged, and the night’s progress from here was familiar. Since accepting his mission he’d spent many nights this way. Asthmatic nights had long been his trial. He brought his blankets about him and looked into the half-light and began the long wait until dawn. </p>

<p class="indent">It disrupted his work and had brought him near death several times, but deeply Marcus knew that his asthma was a blessing, for seldom were these hours of the night wasted. On any day at the mission he had scarcely two moments for himself, and even those were subject to interruption. Too seldom were the times he could find at Ōtaki for private prayer—that very source of ministerial usefulness—and thus by the very practicalities of ministering to his people was his faith hardened and made cold. Therefore he valued these hours of sickness and discomfort, these parcels of opportunity for communion with God. </p>

<p class="indent">Careful not to wake Ruka he brought his hands together and, dictated-to by the demands of his breathing, its rasp and pain, he waited for the stillness to come to him. He was unsettled, and as a way towards the calmer place he went to the Lord’s Prayer, enumerating the first lines in his mind. </p>

<p class="indent">But he could not get far. He couldn’t get free of the frustration that would not be hidden now. His chest hurt and perhaps it fed the irritation—perhaps if he’d not been so burdened—but John had behaved stupidly. He had ridden badly. Marcus could not put down that plain and pragmatic fact now. He had knelt on a flighty horse—who would kneel on his horse to ride into the Turakina, let alone when it was swollen? It was the work of someone completely without experience. It was the work of the most naīve of new chums, and it was bad ministership, and now it had wrought disruption on his people and his family to come. Right now, down in the mission whare, his wife was under that strange and volatile strain—and she’d not even begun to feel the worst of it yet, Marcus knew. She was with child and suffering immense grief and pain. He feared for the life of the child.</p>

<p class="indent">In three years, Burtt had not grown. How vividly Marcus remembered meeting the couple off the brig at Port Nicholson. From the first Burtt had been eager to begin his work up the coast, yet exceedingly ignorant of how to get there, unsure even of how to handle a mission horse once he’d been brought one. And how nervously, on entering Marcus’s accommodation at his own mission, the couple had looked over its bare floor and nibbled at the spartan diet Marcus allowed himself—the hard biscuits and water—and chattered to each other and, as the night wore on, visibly made the best of what were clearly, for them, reduced surroundings. </p>

<p class="indent">And now Marcus flinched to recall the look of sour regard Mrs Burtt had cast, earlier that day, at him and over the whare she now lived in. It had shocked him—she had put up a hard cliff of denial, a resistance to the only consolation Marcus knew. He didn’t know her, this new person. Perhaps it was grief. Perhaps she’d already changed, before the drowning, perhaps because of the very burdens of mission life. He didn’t know.</p>

<p class="indent">But Burtt had not changed. He hadn’t learnt. In three years he’d not become a properly pragmatic man, as was his duty as a missionary of the Society, and Marcus shook his head at the pain of it—the <i>unnecessariness</i> of it—and he couldn’t dwell on it for long, but it was hard. Going towards his old routes to prayer only gave him more time to go over the frustration. He was here in this night and unable to breathe because of that eccentric ride, that poorly chosen horse. He couldn’t breathe properly and his chest tickled madly and Ruka slept on, and he couldn’t get to prayer and for a moment the discomfort seemed very great—too great. </p>

<p class="indent">He needed to stand and be outside, to have the air and the high dark around him, but to walk from this heat to the cold outside the whare would only attack his lungs further and, besides that, out there he would only see down the moonlit pā the new church that had been Burtt’s labour, and the whare of Mrs Burtt, who had turned that bitterly humouring face on him, who had become that hard person he couldn’t understand.</p>

<p class="indent">She was beyond him.</p>

<p class="indent">He had no light to read and could find no path to comfort. Sitting against the wall in his blankets, he sweated for air and itched for the night to end. </p>

<p class="milestone">*</p>

<p class="noindent">He was in the pulpit. Burtt’s body had been found and returned, and now his congregation crammed the pews. Down from the pā and outlying areas they’d come, and right along the walls and at the back and outside the door people were standing, craning to hear what Marcus would say in final tribute to their Reverend. </p>

<p class="indent">So many had arrived since the morning. It was a testament to Burtt—this number of Christian people brought to God. Looking over them, Marcus felt a complicated surge of love and pain. It had made Burtt boyish with joy, this church, his knowledge that all its pews could be filled. </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus shuffled the few pages of notes he’d written for the service. It was impossible to begin. He had not expected to bury Burtt. He wasn’t ready to do so. It was an entirely different thing, to bury in his own churchyard a man like Burtt, freshly ordained a Reverend not three months before and expecting a child. </p>

<p class="indent">But he lifted his head. They were all looking to him. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Mē inoi tātou,’ he said, and he led them in the Lord’s Prayer. ‘E tō mātou Matua i te rangi, kia tapu tōu ingoa.’ And the words lent him solidity. He was short of breath and he had to pause, and he felt the congregation listening for him each time, knowing his asthma was on him, but through the wheeze of his own breathing he heard the growing certainty of his voice, the comfort of his own lilt and timbre. ‘Homai ki a mātou aianei he taro mā mātou mō tēnei rā.’</p>

<p class="indent">He did not need to lift his eyes to see the heads of the congregation, row upon row, bent in devotion; Mrs Burtt and Mrs Williams in the pews nearest him, then Williams and Burtt’s teachers alongside, then the hierarchy of the people of the pā, those who had converted to the faith, which was most of them. He saw them without looking, stretching right back to the door and beyond. ‘Ake, ake ake. Āmine.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Then they sang, and the hundreds of voices swelled out the rafters of the new church, and reverberated there richly. And again at the end of it they looked to him. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Ka koa te hunga e tangi ana: ka whakamārietia hoki rātou.’ And he went on, and again the words lent him strength, the rhythmic on-and-on certainty of the passages he’d chosen and the phrases that went with them, that had flowed in comfort to so many people along the coast for years at moments just like these, and in comfort to him now, until he looked up and saw at the back of the church Jackson, the one Pākehā layman in the building. He was not following the reading in Māori, so Marcus returned to the beginning and gave some of its essence in English, returning and returning to the key messages, its joint building blocks—Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted, and, Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it. </p>

<p class="indent">It was a reward for Jackson, this reprise in English, for Jackson had helped with materials and expertise for the church they all sat in now, and Marcus saw him respond; he saw his eyes lift up and shine. Jackson was from the same shire in England as Burtt, and his faith was of a similar fire, yet carpentry had claimed him and not the church. He’d come to the colony in pragmatic trust in the need for his trade, and in spiritual kinship with Burtt and his new wife, and the death had rocked him. Already he’d come to Marcus and sought reassurance from him about Burtt, about his friend’s spiritual rest and the future of the mission. </p>

<p class="indent">And Marcus returned to te reo Māori so the congregation could follow him again, and they nodded at his words and some murmured agreement, and some simply gave their silent and idiosyncratic responses that every congregation everywhere gave, and Marcus felt the responsibility of them. These were his people again. With Burtt gone these would be part of his work—added to the people of the many pā and the scraps of Pākehā settlement along Kāpiti. He did not protest it, indeed he welcomed the work, but realistically the travel would spread him more thinly among more people. </p>

<p class="indent">He was at the end of what he’d planned to say. So many faces looked up at him. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Friends,’ he said. ‘Reverend Burtt would ask us to voice our approval, for he passes now into the company of the Lord. By the Lord’s favour may we observe his pious example here on earth and hereafter. May the Lord keep his soul. And now we pray for him.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He was nearing the end of the service—he’d almost done his duty to Burtt—and involuntarily he glanced at Mrs Burtt and his throat caught, and simultaneously he realised he’d uttered this last in English, but the congregation didn’t seem to mind and he did not reverse the blunder, because Mrs Burtt was looking beyond him to the front of the church, her ear tilted towards his words as if yearning to hear something in them, and as he looked at that hard and hoping face and the grief it suggested he feared that the unborn child that burdened her now would be lost as well. This child would follow its siblings into death, he felt sure—that seemed very obvious now, just from a glance at this unlucky, obdurate woman, though it would have destroyed Burtt to know of that coming sorrow. </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus couldn’t continue. His voice caught and tears came into his eyes. He was grieving now. His eyes were wet for his friend. He abandoned his last notes and went straight to suggesting the hymn, and he felt a look pass between some at the irregularity of it, and he didn’t care, and the people lifted their voices and sang, the women high above the men, and he passed his sleeve over his eyes, and though it had the smell of the river in it, the rough contact of the wool was good, and when he took it away the high last harmony of the waiata was circling, and he joined them in the Āmine. </p>

<p class="indent">Then he led them outside and the pallbearers followed with Burtt in the casket and he felt much better out there, in fresher air. Beyond the people and the church and the mission whare he saw unclaimed sky and some lifting scraps of cloud and it calmed him. Burtt had ministered here and felt the rewards of it here, and he would end here, and tomorrow or the next day Marcus would be able to return to his own mission home. </p>

<p class="indent">He said the last words over the grave and went among the people, and thanked them and reassured them. He expressed his gratitude for their long hospitality towards the Burtts and him and the Missionary Society. </p>

<p class="indent">Finally he let Mrs Burtt come to him. He took her hands. She looked exhausted, but seemly. She had been washed by the service and cleaned. </p>

<p class="indent">‘Thank you, sir,’ she said. ‘I know John would be honoured.’ </p>

<p class="indent">He smiled gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">‘You know John had a very high regard for you, Reverend,’ she said. ‘The very highest. He considered you the most noble of Christians.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Marcus felt very tall above her. Behind her most of the congregation had turned and were walking up the pā. </p>

<p class="indent">She released his hands, but talked on. ‘John said it was the highest honour to work this coast with you. He admired your work at Kāpiti and wanted only to emulate it here. And I am grateful to you, too.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘I see you have Mrs Williams with you,’ said Marcus. </p>

<p class="indent">Mrs Burtt turned to survey the catechist’s wife across the yard, and again it was that look of plain regard that she sent across, the look that had alarmed Marcus several times now. ‘Yes, I do have her,’ she said. ‘That is true, I suppose.’ </p>

<p class="indent">‘It is good to hear that of John,’ said Marcus. ‘I am sure I felt the same for him, poor fellow. He was a true friend. I admired his love of the Lord. He goes with God now.’ </p>

<p class="indent">Mrs Burtt nodded, then looked at something beyond him. ‘Thank you, Reverend,’ she said. </p>

<p class="indent">‘God bless you,’ said Marcus. </p>

<p class="indent">But she had already turned, and not to talk to other members of the congregation but simply to finish the conversation with Marcus, it seemed. With her hands down at her sides she went away.</p>

<p class="indent">Marcus spoke to some others, then conferred with Williams on when they would next meet on administrative matters concerning Te Awanui. Then he went up the pā to speak to Burtt’s teachers. The walk took him past the mission whare, and at the back of the small house he caught sight of Pono yarded in a pen of mānuka poles, where he had nothing but hard mud and chewed-down plants to eat. Yet the horse was nibbling at the scant plants all the same, and Marcus almost laughed to see Pono doing that, to see his lips groping out so valiantly. He whistled and the horse looked up, his ears circling and ready, and Marcus felt some of his own tension leave his body. For this short moment he was unrequired by the people, by anybody, and he spent it watching the horse and anticipating his trip back down the coast in a day’s time, with luck, or in two. He looked forward to the solitude of it, to the communion only with his horse and the lightly worn trail.</p>
