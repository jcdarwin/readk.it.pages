<p>Thackeray, an only child, was born in Calcutta, India, where his
father, Richmond Thackeray (1 September 1781 – 13 September 1815),
held the high rank of secretary to the board of revenue in the
British East India Company. His mother, Anne Becher (1792–1864;
second daughter of John Harman Becher, a writer for the East India
Company, and his wife Harriet), married Richmond Thackeray on 13
October 1810 after being sent to India in 1809. She was sent abroad
after being told that the man she loved, Henry Carmichael-Smyth,
had died. This was not true, but her family wanted a better
marriage for her than with Carmichael-Smyth, a military man. The
truth was unexpectedly revealed in 1812, when Richmond Thackeray
unwittingly invited to dinner the supposedly dead Carmichael-Smyth.
Richmond Thackeray, born at South Mimms, went to India at the age
of sixteen to assume his duties as writer. By 1804 he had fathered
a daughter by a native mistress, the mother and daughter being
named in his will. Such liaisons being common among gentlemen of
the East India Company, it formed no bar to his courting and
marrying Anne Becher. After Richmond's death, Henry
Carmichael-Smyth married Anne in 1818 and they returned to England
the next year. William had been sent to England earlier, at the age
of five, with a short stopover at St. Helena where the imprisoned
Napoleon was pointed out to him. He was educated at schools in
Southampton and Chiswick and then at Charterhouse School, where he
was a close friend of John Leech. He disliked Charterhouse,
parodying it in his later fiction as "Slaughterhouse." Illness in
his last year there (during which he reportedly grew to his full
height of 6'3") postponed his matriculation at Trinity College,
Cambridge, until February 1829. Never too keen on academic studies,
he left the University in 1830. He travelled for some time on the
continent, visiting Paris and Weimar, where he met Goethe. He
returned to England and began to study law at the Middle Temple,
but soon gave that up. On reaching twenty-one, he came into his
inheritance, but he squandered much of it on gambling and by
funding two unsuccessful newspapers, The National Standard and The
Constitutional, which he had hoped to write for. He also lost a
good part of his fortune in the collapse of two Indian banks.
Forced to consider a profession to support himself, he turned first
to art, which he studied in Paris, but he did not pursue it, except
in later years as the illustrator of some of his own novels and
other writings. Thackeray's years of semi-idleness ended after he
met and, on 20 August 1836, married Isabella Gethin Shawe
(1816-1893), second daughter of Matthew Shawe, a colonel, who had
died after extraordinary service, primarily in India, and his wife,
Isabella Creagh. The marriage appears to have been a very happy
one, though beset by problems (an overbearing mother-in-law and
sickness). Their three daughters were Anne Isabella (1837-1919),
Jane (1837; died at 8 months) and Harriet Marian (1840-1875). He
now began "writing for his life," as he put it, turning to
journalism in an effort to support his young family. He primarily
worked for Fraser's Magazine, a sharp-witted and sharp-tongued
conservative publication, for which he produced art criticism,
short fictional sketches, and two longer fictional works, Catherine
and The Luck of Barry Lyndon. Later, through his connection to the
illustrator John Leech, he began writing for the newly created
Punch magazine, where he published The Snob Papers, later collected
as The Book of Snobs. This work popularized the modern meaning of
the word "snob." Meanwhile tragedy struck in his personal life as
his wife succumbed to depression after the birth of their third
child. Finding he could get no work done at home, he spent more and
more time away, until September 1840, when he noticed how grave her
condition was and, struck by guilt, he took his ailing wife to
Ireland. During the crossing she threw herself from a water-closet
into the sea (from which she was rescued). They fled back home
after a four-week domestic battle with her mother. From November
1840 to February 1842 she was in and out of professional care, her
condition waxing and waning. In the long run she deteriorated into
a permanent state of detachment from reality, unaware of the world
around her. Thackeray desperately sought cures for her, but nothing
worked, and she ended up confined in a home near Paris, where she
remained until 1893, outliving her husband by thirty years. After
his wife's illness, Thackeray became a de facto widower, never
establishing another permanent relationship. He did pursue other
women, in particular Mrs. Jane Brookfield and Sally Baxter. In 1851
Mr. Brookfield barred Thackeray from further visits to or
correspondence with Jane, while Baxter, an American twenty years
his junior whom he met in New York City in 1852, married another
man in 1855. In the early 1840s, Thackeray had some success with
two travel books, The Paris Sketch Book and The Irish Sketch Book.
Later in the decade, he achieved some notoriety with his Snob
Papers, but the work that really established his fame was the novel
Vanity Fair, which first appeared in serialized installments
beginning in January 1847. Even before Vanity Fair completed its
serial run, Thackeray had become a celebrity, sought after by the
very lords and ladies he satirized and hailed as the equal of
Dickens. He remained "at the top of the tree," as he put it, for
the remaining decade and a half of his life, producing several
large novels, notably Pendennis, The Newcomes, and The History of
Henry Esmond, despite various illnesses, including a near fatal one
that struck him in 1849 in the middle of writing Pendennis. He
twice visited the United States on lecture tours during this
period, and there fell in love with a young American girl, Sally
Baxter. Thackeray also gave lectures in London, on the English
humourists of the eighteenth century, and on the first four
Hanoverian monarchs, the latter series being published in book form
as The Four Georges. In Oxford, he stood unsuccessfully as an
independent for Parliament. He was narrowly beaten by Cardwell
(1070 votes, against 1005 for Thackeray). In 1860, Thackeray became
editor of the newly established Cornhill Magazine, but was never
comfortable as an editor, preferring to contribute to the magazine
as a columnist, producing his Roundabout Papers for it. His health
worsened during the 1850s and he was plagued by the recurring
stricture of the urethra that laid him up for days at a time. He
also felt he had lost much of his creative impetus. He worsened
matters by over-eating and drinking and avoiding exercise, though
he enjoyed horseback riding and kept a horse. On 23 December 1863,
after returning from dining out and before dressing for bed,
Thackeray suffered a stroke and was found dead on his bed in the
morning. His death at the age of fifty-three was entirely
unexpected by his family, friends, and reading public. An estimated
7000 people attended his funeral at Kensington Gardens. He was
buried on 29 December at Kensal Green Cemetery, and a memorial bust
sculpted by Marochetti can be found in Westminster Abbey. Source:
