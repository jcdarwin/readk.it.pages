Karenina</em></a>
<p>Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair between the
sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count
Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage
and must endure the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and
richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's
seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the
contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love
and family happiness.</p>

Chatterley's Lover</em></a>
<p>Lady Chatterley's Lover is a novel by D. H. Lawrence written in
1928.<br />
Printed privately in Florence in 1928, it was not printed in the
United Kingdom until 1960 (other than in an underground edition
issued by Inky Stephensen's Mandrake Press in 1929). Lawrence
considered calling this book Tenderness at one time and made
significant alterations to the original manuscript in order to make
it palatable to readers. It has been published in three different
versions.<br />
The publication of the book caused a scandal due to its explicit
sex scenes, including previously banned four-letter words, and
perhaps because the lovers were a working-class male and an
aristocratic female.<br />
The story is said to have originated from events in Lawrence's own
unhappy domestic life, and he took inspiration for the settings of
the book from Ilkeston in Derbyshire where he lived for a while.
According to some critics the fling of Lady Ottoline Morrell with
"Tiger", a young stonemason who came to carve plinths for her
garden statues, also influenced the story.</p>

of Innocence</em></a>
<p>The Age of Innocence centers on one society couple's impending
marriage and the introduction of a scandalous woman whose presence
threatens their happiness. Though the novel questions the
assumptions and mores of turn of the century New York society, it
never devolves into an outright condemnation of the institution. In
fact, Wharton considered this novel an "apology" for the earlier,
more brutal and critical, "The House of Mirth". Not to be
overlooked is the author's attention to detailing the charms and
customs of this caste. The novel is lauded for its accurate
portrayal of how the nineteenth-century East Coast American upper
class lived and this combined with the social tragedy earned
Wharton a Pulitzer - the first Pulitzer awarded to a woman.</p>

Heights</em></a>
<p>Wuthering Heights is Emily Brontë's only novel. It was first
published in 1847 under the pseudonym Ellis Bell, and a posthumous
second edition was edited by her sister Charlotte. The name of the
novel comes from the Yorkshire manor on the moors on which the
story centres (as an adjective, wuthering is a Yorkshire word
referring to turbulent weather). The narrative tells the tale of
the all-encompassing and passionate, yet thwarted, love between
Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and how this unresolved passion
eventually destroys them and many around them.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly is an anti-slavery
novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe. Published in 1852,
the novel had a profound effect on attitudes toward African
Americans and slavery in the United States, so much so in the
latter case that the novel intensified the sectional conflict
leading to the American Civil War.</p>

with a View</em></a>
<p>This Edwardian social comedy explores love and prim propriety
among an eccentric cast of characters assembled in an Italian
pensione and in a corner of Surrey, England.</p>
<p>A charming young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch, faints into the
arms of a fellow Britisher when she witnesses a murder in a
Florentine piazza. Attracted to this man, George Emerson—who is
entirely unsuitable and whose father just may be a Socialist—Lucy
is soon at war with the snobbery of her class and her own
conflicting desires. Back in England, she is courted by a more
acceptable, if stifling, suitor and soon realizes she must make a
startling decision that will decide the course of her future: she
is forced to choose between convention and passion.</p>

Bovary</em></a>
<p>Madame Bovary scandalized its readers when it was first
published in 1857. And the story itself remains as fresh today as
when it was first written, a work that remains unsurpassed in its
unveiling of character and society. It tells the tragic story of
the romantic but empty-headed Emma Rouault. When Emma marries
Charles Bovary, she imagines she will pass into the life of luxury
and passion that she reads about in sentimental novels and women's
magazines. But Charles is an ordinary country doctor, and
provincial life is very different from the romantic excitement for
which she yearns. In her quest to realize her dreams she takes a
lover, Rodolphe, and begins a devastating spiral into deceit and
despair. And Flaubert captures every step of this catastrophe with
sharp-eyed detail and a wonderfully subtle understanding of human
emotions.</p>
