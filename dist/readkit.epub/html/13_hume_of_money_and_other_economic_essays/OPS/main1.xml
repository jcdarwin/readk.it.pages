<p>The chapters of this eBook were extracted from Hume's collection
titled&#160;<em>Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects, Volume
1</em>, in 1777, reformatted for eBook style. &#160;</p>
<p><span>The Introduction was actually included by Hume as the
first portion of his essay "Of Commerce" but here it has been
relocated from that chapter into its own section because it is
appropriate to the entire collection, not just the commerce essay.
&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>The entire original text of Hume's volumes may be seen at
the website www.davidhume.org, from which this eBook was derived.
&#160; Terms of that website require that the content of this eBook
not be used for commercial purposes, only for personal and
