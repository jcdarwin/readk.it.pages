Melon, in his political essay on commerce, asserts, that even at
present, if you divide France into 20 parts, 16 are labourers or
peasants; two only artizans; one belonging to the law, church, and
military; and one merchants, financiers, and bourgeois. This
calculation is certainly very erroneous. In France, England, and
indeed most parts of Europe, half of the inhabitants live in
cities; and even of those who live in the country, a great number
are artizans, perhaps above a third.</span></div>

more ancient Romans lived in perpetual war with all their
neighbours: And in old Latin, the term hostis, expressed both a
stranger and an enemy. This is remarked by Cicero; but by him is
ascribed to the humanity of his ancestors, who softened, as much as
possible, the denomination of an enemy, by calling him by the same
appellation which signified a stranger. De Off. lib. ii. It is
however much more probable, from the manners of the times, that the
ferocity of those people was so great as to make them regard all
strangers as enemies, and call them by the same name. It is not,
besides, consistent with the most common maxims of policy or of
nature, that any state should regard its public enemies with a
friendly eye, or preserve any such sentiments for them as the Roman
orator would ascribe to his ancestors. Not to mention, that the
early Romans really exercised piracy, as we learn from their first
treaties with Carthage, preserved by Polybius, lib. iii. and
consequently, like the Sallee and Algerine rovers, were actually at
war with most nations, and a stranger and an enemy were with them
almost synonimous.</span></div>

Private soldier in the Roman infantry had a denarius a day,
somewhat less than eightpence. The Roman emperors had commonly 25
legions in pay, which allowing 5000 men to a legion, makes 125,000.
Tacit. Ann. lib. iv. It is true, there were also auxiliaries to the
legions; but their [Mil 283] numbers are uncertain, as well as
their pay. To consider only the legionaries, the pay of the private
men could not exceed 1,600,000 pounds. Now, the parliament in the
last war commonly allowed for the fleet 2,500,000. We have
therefore 900,000 over for the officers and other expences of the
Roman legions. There seem to have been but few officers in the
Roman armies, in comparison of what are employed in all our modern
troops, except some Swiss corps. And these officers had very small
pay: A centurion, for instance, only double a common soldier. And
as the soldiers from their pay (Tacit. Ann. lib. i. ) bought their
own cloaths, arms, tents, and baggage; this must also diminish
considerably the other charges of the army. So little expensive was
that mighty government, and so easy was its yoke over the world.
And, indeed, this is the more natural conclusion from the foregoing
calculations. For money, after the conquest of AEgypt, seems to
have been nearly in as great plenty at Rome, as it is at present in
the richest of the European kingdoms.</span></div>

facts I give upon the authority of Mons. du Tot in his Reflections
politiques, an author of reputation. Though I must confess, that
the facts which he advances on other occasions, are often so
suspicious, as to make his authority less in this matter. However,
the general observation, that the augmenting of the money in France
does not at first proportionably augment the prices, is certainly
just. Mo [Q].2 By the by, this seems to be one of the best reasons
which can be given, for a gradual and universal encrease of the
denomination of money, though [Mil 288] it has been entirely
overlooked in all those volumes which have been written on that
question by Melon, Du Tot, and Paris de Verney. Were all our money,
for instance, recoined, and a penny’s worth of silver taken from
every shilling, the new shilling would probably purchase every
thing that could have been bought by the old; the prices of every
thing would thereby be insensibly diminished; foreign trade
enlivened; and domestic industry, by the circulation of a great
number of pounds and shillings, would receive some encrease and
encouragement. In executing such a project, it would be better to
make the new shilling pass for 24 halfpence, in order to preserve
the illusion, and make it be taken for the same. And as a recoinage
of our silver begins to be requisite, by the continual wearing of
our shillings and sixpences, it may be doubtful, whether we ought
to imitate the example in King William’s reign, when the clipt
money was raised to the old standard.</span></div>

operation, which checks the wrong balance of trade, to every
particular nation to which the kingdom trades. When we import more
goods than we export, the exchange turns against us, and this
becomes a new encouragement to export; as much as the charge of
carriage and insurance of the money which becomes due would amount
to. For the exchange can never rise but a little higher than that
sum.</span></div>

must carefully be remarked, that throughout this discourse,
wherever I speak of the level of money, I mean always its
proportional level to the commodities, labour, industry, and skill,
which is in the several states. And I assert, that where these
advantages are double, triple, quadruple, to what they are in the
neighbouring states, the money infallibly will also be double,
triple, quadruple. The only circumstance that can obstruct the
exactness of these proportions, is the expence of transporting the
commodities from one place to another; and this expence is
sometimes unequal. Thus the corn, cattle, cheese, butter, of
Derbyshire, cannot draw the money of London, so much as the
manufactures of London draw the money of Derbyshire. But this
objection is only a seeming one: For so far as the transport of
commodities is expensive, so far is the communication between the
places obstructed and imperfect.</span></div>

observed in Essay III. [Of Money.] that money, when encreasing,
gives encouragement to industry, during the interval between the
encrease of money and rise of the prices. A good effect of this
nature may follow too from paper-credit; but it is dangerous to
precipitate matters, at the risk of losing all by the failing of
that credit, as must happen upon any violent shock in public
affairs.</span></div>

half a century, had not our fathers’ prophecies of this kind been
