mankind may be divided into two classes; that of <em>shallow</em>
thinkers, who fall short of the truth; and that of
<em>abstruse</em> thinkers, who go beyond it. The latter class are
by far the most rare: and I may add, by far the most useful and
valuable. They suggest hints, at least, and start difficulties,
which they want, perhaps, skill to pursue; but which may produce
fine discoveries, when handled by men who have a more just way of
thinking. At worst, what they say is uncommon; and if it should
cost some pains to comprehend it, one has, however, the pleasure of
hearing something that is new. An author is little to be valued,
who tells us nothing but what we can learn from every coffee-house
conversation.</p>
<p>All people of <em>shallow</em> thought are apt to decry even
those&#160;of <em>solid</em> understanding, as <em>abstruse</em>
thinkers, and metaphysicians, and refiners; and never will allow
any thing to be just which is beyond their own weak conceptions.
There are some cases, I own, where an extraordinary refinement
affords a strong presumption of falsehood, and where no reasoning
is to be trusted but what is natural and easy. When a man
deliberates concerning his conduct in any <em>particular</em>
affair, and forms schemes in politics, trade, oeconomy, or any
business in life, he never ought to draw his arguments too fine, or
connect too long a chain of consequences together. Something is
sure to happen, that will disconcert his reasoning, and produce an
event different from what he expected. But when we reason upon
general subjects, one may justly affirm, that our speculations can
scarcely ever be too fine, provided they be just; and that the
difference between a common man and a man of genius is chiefly seen
in the shallowness or depth of the principles upon which they
proceed. General reasonings seem intricate, merely because they are
general; nor is it easy for the bulk of mankind to distinguish, in
a great number of particulars, that common circumstance in which
they all agree, or to extract it, pure and unmixed, from the other
superfluous circumstances. Every judgment or conclusion, with them,
is particular. They cannot enlarge their view to those universal
propositions, which comprehend under them an infinite number of
individuals, and include a whole science in a single theorem. Their
eye is confounded with such an extensive prospect; and the
conclusions, derived from it, even though clearly expressed, seem
intricate and obscure. But however intricate they may seem, it is
certain, that general principles, if just and sound, must always
prevail in the general course of things, though they may fail in
particular cases; and it is the chief business of philosophers to
regard the general course of things. I may add, that it is also the
chief business of politicians; especially in the domestic
government of the state, where the public good, which is, or ought
to be their object, depends on the concurrence of a multitude of
causes; not, as in foreign politics, on accidents and chances, and
the caprices of a few persons. This therefore makes the difference
between <em>particular</em> deliberations and <em>general</em>
reasonings, and renders subtilty and refinement much more suitable
to the latter than to the former.</p>
<p>I thought this introduction necessary before the following
discourses on <em>commerce, money, interest, balance of trade,
&amp;c.</em> where, perhaps, there will occur some principles which
are uncommon, and which may seem too refined and subtile for such
vulgar subjects. If false, let them be rejected. But no one ought
to entertain a prejudice against them, merely because they are out
of the common road.</p>
