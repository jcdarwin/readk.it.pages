Art of Public Speaking</em></a>
<p>Training in public speaking is not a matter of
externals--primarily; it is not a matter of
imitation--fundamentally; it is not a matter of conformity to
standards--at all. Public speaking is public utterance, public
issuance, of the man himself; therefore the first thing both in
time and in importance is that the man should be and think and feel
things that are worthy of being given forth. Unless there be
something of value within, no tricks of training can ever make of
the talker anything more than a machine--albeit a highly perfected
machine--for the delivery of other men's goods. So self-development
is fundamental in our plan.</p>

Art of Money Getting, or Golden Rules for Making Money</em></a>
<p>P. T. Barnum, the great American showman of the 19th century,
wrote this short book about making and keeping money. He certainly
had life experiences that qualify him for the subject--he started a
small newspaper in his twenties, bought and transformed a museum
into a showplace for curiosities, built a circus empire that gave
performances in America and Europe, promoted a performing tour of a
singer, fell into debt in the 1850s and pulled himself out by
lecture tours, was a mayor, and founded a hospital.</p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p>"Those who really desire to attain an independence, have only to
set their minds upon it, and adopt the proper means, as they do in
regard to any other object which they wish to accomplish, and the
thing is easily done. But however easy it may be found to make
money, I have no doubt many of my hearers will agree it is the most
difficult thing in the world to keep it. ... True economy consists
in always making the income exceed the out-go."</p>
<p>"Unless a man enters upon the vocation intended for him by
nature, and best suited to his peculiar genius, he cannot succeed.
I am glad to believe that the majority of persons do find their
right vocation. Yet we see many who have mistaken their
calling..."</p>
<p>His advice is indicated by the chapter titles:</p>
<p>DON'T MISTAKE YOUR VOCATION,</p>
<p>SELECT THE RIGHT LOCATION,</p>
<p>AVOID DEBT,</p>
<p>PERSEVERE,</p>
<p>WHATEVER YOU DO, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT,</p>
<p>USE THE BEST TOOLS,</p>
<p>DON'T GET ABOVE YOUR BUSINESS,</p>
<p>LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL,</p>
<p>LET HOPE PREDOMINATE, BUT BE NOT TOO VISIONARY,</p>
<p>DO NOT SCATTER YOUR POWERS,</p>
<p>BE SYSTEMATIC,</p>
<p>READ THE NEWSPAPERS,</p>
<p>BEWARE OF "OUTSIDE OPERATIONS",</p>
<p>DON'T INDORSE WITHOUT SECURITY,</p>
<p>ADVERTISE YOUR BUSINESS,</p>
<p>"DON'T READ THE OTHER SIDE",</p>
<p>BE POLITE AND KIND TO YOUR CUSTOMERS,</p>
<p>BE CHARITABLE,</p>
<p>DON'T BLAB,</p>
<p>PRESERVE YOUR INTEGRITY.</p>
