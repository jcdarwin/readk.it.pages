<p>DAVID HUME is known for his philosophical writings, but he also
wrote on politics, history, and economics. This eBook contains 7
economic essays which were first published in Hume's <em>Political
Discourses</em> (1752) and again in&#160;<em>Essays and Treatises
on Several Subjects, Volume 1</em>&#160;(1777). &#160;One essay has
been praised by the Nobel-Prize-winning economist, Paul Krugman,
who said in his newspaper column:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"… Hume also helped found economics: his 'Of the Balance of
Trade', published 34 years before&#160;<em>The Wealth of
Nations</em>, was arguably the first example of modern economic
reasoning, based on what amounts to a stylized model, albeit one
without any equations or diagrams." (<em>New York Times</em>, 8 May
2011, "Hume Day".)</p>
<p>… "You could argue that modern economics really began with David
Hume’s 'Of the Balance of Trade', whose core is a gloriously clear
thought experiment… ." (<em>ibid.</em>, 2 Feb 2011, "Models, Plain
and Fancy".)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adam Smith, the author of&#160;<em>The Wealth of Nations</em>
(1776), is commonly considered the "father of modern economics",
but Hume pre-dated Smith in that regard. Both were Scottish
philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment, and although Hume was a
decade older than Smith, they became lifelong friends after they
met in 1750.</p>
<p>These essays cover Commerce, Money, Interest, Balance of Trade,
Jealousy of Trade, Taxes, and Pubic Credit. Hume explained economic
phenomena that we observe even today, such as the eventual
self-correction of job migration to lower cost countries, money
supply issues, the undesirable results of tariffs, military buildup
in underdeveloped countries, the relationship between wages and
labor supply, and other topics that give insights into the
happenings we read about in the news almost daily.</p>
