			<p class="a-chapter">Author’s Note</p>
			<p class="a-flush">The Aro Valley is a real place and is much as I’ve described it, although I’ve taken various geographic liberties: inventing shops, landscaping parks and moving streets around.</p>
			<p class="a-indent">‘Aro’ is a Maori word meaning ‘understanding’. The Aro Valley is sometimes referred to as Te Aro which means ‘incomprehensible’.</p>
			<p class="a-indent">There are—to my knowledge—no hollowed-out tenement buildings teeming with cultists in the Aro Valley at present, although there are several buildings that would be suitable for such a purpose.</p>
