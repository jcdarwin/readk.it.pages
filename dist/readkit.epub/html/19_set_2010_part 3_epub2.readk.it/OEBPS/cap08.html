<p class="hang1">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student teachers in this article learnt a great deal from the students they taught, and modified their teaching in response.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They learnt from direct and indirect student feedback&#8212;such as whether their pupils understood what was taught and whether the lessons were engaging.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They learnt about how to teach effectively&#8212;for example, how to plan lessons, how to give instructions and how to maintain discipline.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also learnt about teacher&#8211;student relationships&#8212;the importance of having good relationships and the importance of maintaining an authoritative role.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They noticed that teaching in different contexts (for example, the senior school versus the junior school) gave quite different learning experiences.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These student teachers at first found it hard to think what they had learnt from their students, but on reflection found considering this question illuminating.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">Student teachers face a set of complex challenges, particularly in their work in schools, where they have to work closely with associate teachers and the students they teach. The study described in this article sought to examine the teaching experiences of a group of student teachers through their eyes, with a focus on what they thought they had learnt from the students they taught.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Traditionally, the learning process has been seen as a one-way process, from the teacher to the learner. The M&#257;ori word <i>ako</i> reminds us that learning can work in both directions&#8212;that learning is a reciprocal activity (Royal-Tangaere, 1997). While it is not uncommon for a student to help a teacher to understand the use of computer software, or how a piece of digital equipment works, are there other, more important things that teachers can learn from the people they are teaching? Students are not just expert in the use of technology, they are also experts about teachers and teaching. So, what can student teachers learn about being a teacher from the students they teach?</p>
<p class="indent">This article describes a pilot study that aimed to understand the perspectives of student teachers. By looking at the experience of student teaching through their eyes, the study sought to answer the question: What do student teachers learn from the learners they teach? The answers will help to inform those who work as associate teachers and may help to ensure that the experiences of student teachers are supportive of their development as teachers. In addition, there are messages that can be applicable to all teachers, irrespective of the length of their experience.</p>
<p class="indent">A great deal is written about the function, value and problems related to student teachers&#8217; teaching in schools. There is considerable variance in the way teaching experience is designed and placed within preservice programmes. Teaching experience (&#8220;student teaching&#8221; or &#8220;practicum&#8221;) is a critical aspect of preservice teacher education, and associate teachers are key participants in determining the quality of learning for student teachers (Zeichner, 2002). Some writers (Bullough &#38; Draper, 2004; Lind, 2004) have examined the complete triad of relationships between those who are involved in the student teaching experience: the student teacher, the associate teacher and the visiting lecturer. The triad is a site of power negotiation and positioning, where each party is seeking to preserve themselves and achieve control over the situation. Ignorance of the other parties&#8217; roles, lack of trust and lack of professional respect are seen as having serious impact on the student teachers. Lind notes: &#8220;&#8230; The practicum is a complex socio-cultural environment in which intense professional relationships develop as a result of strong emotional responses to often challenging classroom scenarios&#8221; (2004, p. 138). Lind&#8217;s study did not examine the role of school students.</p>
<p class="indent">A number of writers identify the need for more emphasis on the perspectives of student teachers. Korthagen, Loughran and Russell (2006) note that there is little evidence of student teachers&#8217; views in the literature. Furthermore, in their survey of teacher education research, Wideen, Mayer-Smith and Moon (1998) state, &#8220;Where the voice of student teachers was presented, we found them struggling for control, and we heard words of frustration, anger, and bewilderment&#8221; (p. 159). They also found a tendency to treat participants as silent objects of research. Lind (2004, p. 13) cites the finding of Korthagen and Kessels (1999), who argue that teaching needs to be viewed through the eyes of the student teacher.</p>
<p class="indent">The need for a focus on the student teacher perspective was noted in Cameron and Baker&#8217;s 2004 literature review on New Zealand teacher education. They suggest that this would be helpful for identifying ways to improve teacher education. Loughran also states that there is a need for teacher educators to see &#8220;&#8230; practice through our students&#8217; eyes&#8221; (personal communication, 6 September 2006). Furthermore, Brouwer and Korthagen (2005) discuss the problem of measuring the effect of teacher education programmes on conceptions of teaching, and the extent to which preservice teacher education overcomes the long-term effect of what student teachers learnt in their experiences of being school students themselves (Lortie, 1975). &#8220;If answers to such questions are to be found, more research is needed into the ways in which prospective teachers learn from practice and how, during this process, competence and attitudes develop in interaction with each other&#8221; (Brouwer &#38; Korthagen, 2005, p. 217).</p>
<p class="indent">Although many studies investigate the impact of specific parts of teacher education programmes, or explore the influence of one or more of the groups of people involved, there appears to be little written on student teachers&#8217; perception of the influence of the students they teach on their development as teachers. There is a need to examine student teachers&#8217; perceptions of their successes and failures and their positive and negative experiences when working with students.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, this pilot study sought to examine the ways in which student teachers are affected by the students they teach, by looking at teaching experience through the eyes of student teachers.</p>
<h2 class="left">Who was involved?</h2>
<p class="noindent">A randomly selected group of 12 student teachers in the 2008 Graduate Secondary programme at Victoria University College of Education were invited to be involved in the study. From this group, four agreed to participate and are referred to by the pseudonyms Mary, Jenny, Trisha and James. Mary was teaching senior history and Year 10 social studies; Jenny was teaching music at Years 7 and 8 level; Trisha was teaching drama and music at both junior and senior secondary; and James was teaching science, up to Year 11, and senior biology. Three of these student teachers had completed two teaching experiences and the fourth had completed the full set of three teaching experiences.</p>
<h2 class="left">What was done?</h2>
<p class="noindent">Mary and Jenny were interviewed immediately following an observed teaching episode, whereas Trisha and James were interviewed using the same questions at the conclusion of their teaching experience. All four students were asked the same eight questions to investigate their views about teaching and learning, and their perceptions of the influence of others, particularly students, on their development as teachers. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. A transcript of the recordings was emailed to the participants to check for accuracy.</p>
<h2 class="left">Data analysis</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the analysis of the interview data, I sought to avoid reliance on preset hypotheses (Cohen, Manion, &#38; Morrison, 2000). Rather, a grounded theory approach was used for analysing the data (Strauss &#38; Corbin, 1998). The perspectives of the student teachers were the determining factor in processing the data. Thus, the study attempted to build &#8220;a set of well-developed categories (for example, themes, concepts) that are systematically interrelated through statements of relationship to form a theoretical framework &#8230;&#8221; (Strauss &#38; Corbin, 1998, p. 22). Analysis of qualitative data produced from open-ended questions was undertaken using the coding software NVivo 8.0 to facilitate the identification and analysis of the themes that emerged from the student teachers&#8217; responses to the interview questions.</p>
<p class="indent">The initial themes that emerged can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learners&#8217; positive responses to teaching.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learners&#8217; negative responses to teaching.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching that was effective.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching that was ineffective.</p>
<p class="noindent">These themes were then re-examined in relation to the question, &#8220;What can student teachers learn about being a teacher from the students they teach?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">In the light of this question, the interview responses can be organised into the following overall themes:</p>
<p class="num">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessons from student feedback.</p>
<p class="num">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessons about effective teaching.</p>
<p class="num">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessons about teacher&#8211;student relationships.</p>
<p class="noindent">I will discuss the findings of the study by looking at each of these three themes.</p>
<h2 class="left">What was found?</h2>
<h3 class="left">Lessons from student feedback</h3>
<p class="noindent">The student teachers discussed the influence on their teaching of direct and indirect feedback from students. James said, &#8220;I really like the way sometimes you can get kids at the end of a class, they can come up and say, &#8216;Thank you, I finally understand this bit.&#8217;&#8221; James also valued the indirect feedback he received about his teaching: &#8220;Seeing the way the kids reacted to the experiment and understanding something and it really made me want to push, you know and keep going on that same style of, because it worked.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Trisha discussed her initial response to students&#8217; feedback: &#8220;They would say &#8216;This is boring, Miss&#8217; and I would think &#8216;My goodness!&#8217; I was really hurt. I had to &#8216;Oh, my God, what have I done to make it boring?&#8217;&#8221; However, Trisha was able to overcome her initial emotions, &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve hardened up to it, I think: &#8216;Too bad, I&#8217;m the teacher!&#8217;, you know, &#8216;You have to do it!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Mary talked about what she learnt from indirect feedback: &#8220;&#8230; the kind of unconscious feedback that they give you, like they haven&#8217;t understood and you go around in groups and you hear the kids saying that they&#8217;re not really sure about it, and that&#8217;s when you pick up that you haven&#8217;t taught something properly even when think that you have.&#8221; Mary also valued the way that students show the true value of a teacher&#8217;s planned activities: &#8220;On a piece of paper it might look like a really excellent idea and you give it to the kids and it &#8230; sunk!&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">The level of student responsiveness was an important factor in enabling these student teachers to feel like teachers. For Trisha, there was a difference between junior and senior classes: &#8220;In my senior classes I do feel like a teacher, they all respect me, they listen to what I say, they are always asking questions, they just get so involved.&#8221; Other student teachers agreed that responsive students were a key to feeling like a teacher. Jenny said she felt this way &#8220;When I&#8217;m getting the appropriate response from them and they&#8217;re going, &#8216;Miss, look at my work&#8217;, &#8216;I need your help with this, Miss, please come over.&#8217;&#8221; For Mary it was important that students responded to her as a teacher: &#8220;So, maybe the acknowledgement of &#8216;Good morning&#8217; and &#8216;Goodbye&#8217; and when you&#8217;re walking around.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">James and Mary had used student evaluations to gain their students&#8217; perspectives on their teaching. Mary recounted how that one set of student evaluations showed how much the students appreciated when teachers know and use their names when talking to them. Mary described how difficult it was for a student teacher to learn students&#8217; names in a secondary school:</p>
<p class="blockquote">When you sit at the back you get to know what the back of their heads look like, and you don&#8217;t really know what their face looks like, and lots of teachers a lot of the time don&#8217;t use children&#8217;s names. So, you sit there and you really have no idea who the kids are in this class except for the naughty kids, because that&#8217;s when the teacher uses their name.</p>
<p class="noindent">This information changed how Mary worked with classes, and she had used a number of strategies to learn names as quickly as possible. James acted on feedback from students:</p>
<p class="blockquote">They have a lot of effect on my demeanour in the classroom. A lot of the feedback I&#8217;ve got is the kids appreciate the way I talk to them &#8230; I can talk to them at a level they&#8217;re not feeling threatened. And that was something they told me on my first TE [teaching experience], so it was something that I brung [sic] into my next TE.</p>
<p class="noindent">Trisha said she learnt about the importance of presenting learning challenges from the way her students responded to a lesson where &#8220;I did something that challenged them, a little bit, stuff they haven&#8217;t done before.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Mary also talked about the role students had in creating a successful lesson:</p>
<p class="blockquote">I also learned from the kids, in that particular lesson, that the activities will only work well if the kids really believe in them, because I thought this lesson could have really sink or swim, because it was an awesome activity, but if the kids weren&#8217;t wholly involved with it then they weren&#8217;t going to perform it.</p>
<h3 class="left">Lessons about effective teaching</h3>
<p class="noindent">All four student teachers noted key aspects about effective teaching that they learnt from their students. For Jenny, the key thing she learnt was the need to give concise instructions, &#8220;&#8230; then they can just get on and not have to ask me, rather than me having to elaborate&#8221;. James noted that the success of a particular lesson was due to his planning: &#8220;&#8230; the way I planned the class was in short chunks and quick transitions between activities and it was very effective&#8221;. James saw signs of deeper levels of engagement as enabling him to &#8220;feel like a teacher&#8221;: &#8220;That&#8217;s when I feel like I&#8217;m a teacher, when they want to know more than just getting it done just to sit a test.&#8221; Mary also enjoyed the satisfaction of a successful lesson: &#8220;I suppose when you have kids doing their work and discussing things properly, and your activities are going really well, then you feel that you&#8217;ve succeeded.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Mary talked about the importance of observation, and how by sitting in classrooms watching and listening she learnt that when students were working in groups they often were not on task: &#8220;If the teacher doesn&#8217;t come around the classroom that they will continue to talk, they&#8217;ll still be talking about their weekend and things. You&#8217;ve got to be really vigilant as the teacher.&#8221; For Trisha, the lessons learnt from her students were straightforward: &#8220;That was one of the biggest things I learnt actually. Yeah, what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Depending on the age as well.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">When asked about what they learnt from their students in an unsuccessful lesson, each student teacher spoke with feeling, as well as self-deprecating humour, about specific lessons. In James&#8217; case, his &#8220;worst&#8221; lesson was one in which he ignored what he had learnt previously in his &#8220;best&#8221; lesson. Rather than &#8220;chunking&#8221; his activities, he spent time in a long introduction to the activity, &#8220;&#8230; and then it sort of went downhill and, you know, the kids just started to play up a bit &#8230; that&#8217;s something I really found, there was about a 10-minute limit to each activity, so I tried to plan about four activities to a class and then round it off, it worked well&#8221;.</p>
<p class="indent">Trisha described a lesson in which the Year 10 students wouldn&#8217;t co-operate with her requests: &#8220;I wanted complete silence, and sometimes you can get it, but this particular day I couldn&#8217;t and it became more of a joke to them.&#8221; From this experience Trisha learnt that she needed to &#8220;get on with it&#8221; and be prepared to &#8220;let things slide sometimes&#8221;.</p>
<p class="indent">Jenny described a lesson in which she had attempted to &#8220;go easy&#8221; on two boys because she knew they had previously been disciplined by another teacher. The boys were noisy and caused distraction in the lesson. From this experience Jenny said, &#8220;I learnt to be more assertive about behaviours and shutting down those low-level behaviours more quickly so they don&#8217;t escalate.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Mary&#8217;s unsuccessful experience was a lesson that she attempted to take outside into the school playground because she wanted to use water. The students were unengaged and quite unco-operative. Mary recognised that she had underestimated how the students would respond when outside the classroom and from that experience accepted the need to set expectations and motivate students by hooking them into an activity: &#8220;&#8230; you really need to pitch stuff to your classes&#8221;.</p>
<h3 class="left">Lessons about teacher&#8211;student relationships</h3>
<p class="noindent">Jenny and Mary learnt about the importance of having effective relationships with their students. For Mary, it was the most important thing she had learnt from her students:</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8230; you&#8217;re only there on their, kind of goodwill, you&#8217;re not their teacher, and they don&#8217;t need to respect you, so I think that it&#8217;s hard to get that respect, and I think that with the students you&#8217;ve got to get a nice relationship with them, otherwise it&#8217;s just going to be a battle with them.</p>
<p class="noindent">Jenny spoke about how her interactions with one student gave her insight into the teacher&#8217;s role in relationships with students. In particular, she described how an inappropriate response to a student had damaged her relationships with him and how this had impacted on her teaching:</p>
<p class="blockquote">That&#8217;s a really big, strong learning curve, especially in teaching, because you learn from them that what you say has an impact on them, and you need to be careful about what you say, and how you say it, so that you come across the way you intended.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mary acknowledged that the need for an authoritative teaching role was directly communicated by one of her students:</p>
<p class="blockquote">One of the kids was reading and I took something off them and one of the kids said to me &#8216;She really respects you now, &#8216;cos you took that off her&#8217;, which I thought was a very interesting thing to say, and I thought that was good because obviously the kids they think that as an authority figure you need to discipline them in some way when they are out of line.</p>
<p class="noindent">This concept of teacher authority was reiterated: all four student teachers said that they felt like a teacher when students had respect for them; for example, when they had the students&#8217; attention and they were listened to. Trisha explained: &#8220;I suppose the power, if you get it, the power of them listening to you.&#8221; James said, &#8220;I do feel very much like a teacher when I stand up the front and say something and the whole class goes quiet.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="left">General findings</h2>
<p class="noindent">The interviews provide a glimpse into these student teachers&#8217; experiences, the joys and the trials, the challenges and the successes. The student teachers were very candid about their failings and feelings of inadequacy. Mary said, &#8220;I had to tell a girl [off] and give her detention as I&#8217;d got her to do group work and I had told her to get into a group three times and she hid under a desk.&#8221; This feeling of helplessness in the face of an unco-operative student is perhaps one that many student teachers and experienced teachers would relate to, but Mary also experienced challenges of a different kind: &#8220;There&#8217;s one girl who&#8217;s quite smart and she does intimidate me, because sometimes you get the tone from her that she&#8217;s superior and that she knows more and that&#8217;s what she kind of gives off, so that&#8217;s a little intimidating.&#8221; (Mary is a capable, mature woman for whom teaching is a second profession.) This situation is perhaps not uncommon for student teachers in secondary schools. They usually have to teach in their &#8220;second&#8221; subjects, in which they may feel less confident. Even when teaching their major subjects, they often have to teach topics in the school curriculum that they have never previously studied, and they face considerable stress in quickly developing their knowledge of unfamiliar topics within a very short time span.</p>
<p class="indent">The student teachers also shared their joys: &#8220;Then they just got on with the work, and I just sat back and looked at them all going for it, and I thought &#8216;Wow! This is fantastic!&#8217;&#8221; (Jenny). James was still glowing when he recounted one of his successful episodes: &#8220;The look on their face when they pass a test. You know you can tell that they&#8217;re not always ones that are confident about passing a test. I don&#8217;t know, I like that, I like that.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">The student teachers saw that the varying contexts of their teaching experiences provided a range of experiences that contributed in different ways to their development as teachers: socioeconomic factors; differences in school style and organisation; differences in the relationship with and the perceived value of associate teachers; differences in teaching junior or senior students; and differences in the style and expectations of various teaching subjects.</p>
<p class="indent">They seemed confident about their developing practice. Jenny, who had completed her initial teacher education, had already won a position in the school in which she was observed. The others were looking forward positively to their final teaching experience.</p>
<h2 class="left">Discussion</h2>
<p class="noindent">For these student teachers, teaching was a challenging, complex, emotionally charged, but mainly rewarding, experience. These student teachers worked hard to navigate their way through competing ideas about teaching and learning, balancing the ever-increasing requirements of their university course with the multilayered demands of busy school programmes. They had to form working relationships with several different associate teachers in at least two subject areas, and professional relationships with multiple groups of students. In addition, they had to manage their own professional development, as well as their own personal lives and relationships. This is a very difficult role and one that needs the full support of the profession.</p>
<p class="indent">These student teachers valued greatly what they had gained from their teaching experiences, even though at times they had been challenged and occasionally dismayed. Although these student teachers were able to articulate reflectively on their practice, they initially found it difficult to identify what they had learnt from the students they had taught. Whilst they were able to discuss this after some prompting, the idea that they could learn from their students seemed novel. It would seem that encouraging student teachers to think about what they learnt from their students may be a useful strategy to develop a positive attitude to school students as active participants in initial teacher education, rather than just &#8220;guinea pigs&#8221; (as they were described by Trisha).</p>
<p class="indent">The experiences discussed by these student teachers underline the need to recognise the practicum as a complex, multifaceted experience. It is important to acknowledge that contextual variables play a major role in the outcome of the practicum for the student teacher. For example, student teachers&#8217; personal characteristics and resources, the quality of the learning experiences, the level of associate teachers&#8217; support and the quality of the school environment are all potential variables which must be accounted for (Caires &#38; Almeida, 2005; Haigh, Pinder, &#38; McDonald, 2006; Hascher, Cocard, &#38; Moser, 2004; Zeichner, 2002). Such variables clearly affected what these student teachers learnt from the students they taught. For example, the student teachers discussed the increased challenges in managing behaviour in larger junior classes where they were teaching core subjects. The relative amount of junior or senior class teaching available to student teachers is clearly an important variable that needs to be noted.</p>
<p class="indent">The student teachers in this study had identifiable concerns about their development as teachers, which are similar to those described in the teacher education literature (Knowles &#38; Holt-Reynolds, 1991; Polou, Spinthourakis, &#38; Papoulia-Tzelepi, 2002). These include concerns about their own efficacy, their ability to maintain control of students&#8217; behaviour and their levels of subject knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent">These student teachers showed evidence of an idealistic image of themselves as teachers, which is not uncommon among student teachers. In their responses to interview questions, they discussed episodes of cognitive dissonance between their idealised self and the real self. These episodes were either where the student teachers found themselves unable to control the behaviour of their classes or, in at least one case, where the student teacher felt inadequate in their knowledge of the subject being studied.</p>
<p class="indent">For these student teachers, their teaching experiences were highly emotional. Their experiences were in line with Lind&#8217;s description: &#8220;The situations that student teachers are confronted with during their practicum elicit a lot of feelings (for example, feelings of fear), concerns and value conflicts. They cannot be dealt with only at the rational, logical, cognitive level &#8230;&#8221; (2004, p. 18).</p>
<h2 class="left">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="noindent">How did these student teachers view the experience of teaching in schools? They mainly loved their teaching experiences, despite the challenges, the sometimes unco-operative students and the varying levels of support they received from associates and university staff. They valued the real-world experience and they enjoyed the opportunities to &#8220;feel like teachers&#8221;. They found schools to be difficult and challenging places and often struggled to know what they should be doing as they sought to please their associates and fit into the school culture. The student teachers in this study had been exploring their nascent ideas about teaching and learning as they sought to integrate their own experiences as school students with new approaches and policies.</p>
<p class="indent">What do student teachers learn from the children they teach? On reflection, the student teachers in this study were able to articulate the lessons learnt from their students. The student teachers learnt about effective teaching, the key factors in successful teacher&#8211;student relationships and, above all, their students showed them what worked and what didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="indent">For those of us who are experienced teachers, this study raises the challenge of whether we are aware of and open to the messages and feedback provided by the students we teach. The student teachers in this study found it illuminating to answer the question: &#8220;What have you learnt from the students you teach?&#8221; Such a question would provide all of us with a valuable way of investigating our practice.</p>
