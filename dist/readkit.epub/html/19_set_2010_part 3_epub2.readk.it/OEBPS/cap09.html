<p class="noindent1"><b>JULIET TWIST AND HILARY FERRAL</b></p>
<p class="noindent1">Over the last two years researchers at the New Zealand Council for Educational Research (NZCER) have been involved in a complete revision of the Progressive Achievement Test of Listening Comprehension (PAT:Listening Comprehension). Last reviewed in 1992, the tests have been a trusted part of the New Zealand assessment tool kit for 40 years, providing valuable insights into students&#8217; language development. The new edition continues this tradition, with new material carefully chosen and trialled to ensure its relevance for today&#8217;s students. At the same time it breaks new ground, employing modern test development techniques and making use of technology to assist in test administration and support users of the test with scoring and reporting options.</p>
<h2 class="left">Purpose of the test</h2>
<p class="noindent">PAT:Listening Comprehension assesses students&#8217; listening comprehension; that is, it assesses students&#8217; comprehension of texts read <i>to</i> them. Because the texts are read <i>to</i> as opposed to <i>by</i> students, teachers can obtain data on student meaning making that is independent of their ability to decode printed words. This focus reflects <i>The New Zealand Curriculum</i> (Ministry of Education, 2007) requirement that students make meaning of ideas or information in the listening mode. The focus on meaning making also reflects our understanding of the intention of the key competencies as skills for learning in the complex, heterogeneous world of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="indent">The test can be used to measure progress in listening comprehension over time. It will also provide teachers with data that will assist them to group students in ways that will best develop meaning making.</p>
<p class="indent">PAT:Listening Comprehension sits alongside PAT:Reading Comprehension. The two tests assess meaning making in different ways, and together will give teachers a broader and deeper understanding of their students&#8217; thinking about text.</p>
<p class="indent">The listening test reflects the theoretical underpinnings of the reading standards presented in <i>The New Zealand Curriculum Reading and Writing Standards for Years 1&#8211;8</i> (Ministry of Education, 2009). While PAT:Reading Comprehension relates to all three aspects of the act of reading as described in the standards (learning the code of written language, making meaning, and thinking critically), PAT:Listening Comprehension focuses attention on the making meaning and thinking critically aspects.</p>
<h2 class="left">Changes from the previous edition</h2>
<p class="noindent">In writing this edition of PAT:Listening Comprehension we have kept some of the features of the previous edition while incorporating some changes:</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight new standardised listening comprehension tests have been developed for Years 3&#8211;10.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each test is targeted at a particular year level. However, teachers can choose which test they administer to students.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test content has been updated: all the comprehension texts and their accompanying questions are new.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presentation of teacher and student booklets and answer forms has been updated.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The texts, questions and possible answers have been recorded on CDs and are read by professional actors.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions and possible answers are printed in the student booklets (the texts are not).</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The texts are of the type typically used in classroom reading instruction (that is, there are no scripted conversations as there were in the previous edition).</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results will be able to be entered onto the PAT Marking website <a href="http://www.nzcermarking.org.nz">www.nzcermarking.org.nz</a>. A suite of student and class reports will be available as they currently are for PAT: Mathematics and PAT:Reading Comprehension and Vocabulary (see below for more information on this service).</p>
<h2 class="left">Features of PAT:Listening Comprehension</h2>
<h3 class="left">Administration</h3>
<p class="noindent">The tests can be administered at any time during the school year, although it is useful to bear in mind that the data used in the normative reporting were collected at the beginning of the 2010 school year. The items in each test are in multiple-choice format. Students&#8217; responses are recorded in the booklets for the Years 3 and 4 tests. Separate answer sheets are used for recording students&#8217; responses for the Years 5 to 10 tests. The tests are designed to take 40 minutes of testing time. Tests require about 10 minutes of additional time for administration.</p>
<h2 class="left">PAT:Listening Comprehension scale</h2>
<p class="noindent">A new measurement scale has been developed: the PAT:Listening Comprehension (patl) scale. All eight tests are linked to the same underlying scale, which allows progress to be measured from Year 3 to Year 10. With the new scale, meaningful comparisons between scale scores can be made from year to year, from test to test, between individuals, and between groups.</p>
<p class="indent">The patl scale has been qualitatively described in terms of skills and knowledge likely to have been achieved at each part of the scale. These descriptions cover seven elements that have a significant role to play in listening comprehension: using abstract information; using separated information; using multiple pieces of information; using implied information; rejecting competing information; using lexical information; and using prosodic<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ft1">1</a></sup> information.</p>
<p class="indent">The scale scores are supplemented with normative information in the form of stanines. Student results for listening comprehension can be compared with the achievement of a national reference group at specific year levels.</p>
<h2 class="left">Marking and reporting options</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are several options available for reporting and analysing PAT:Listening Comprehension results:</p>
<p class="num">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers can mark by hand using the materials provided in the teacher manual.</p>
<p class="num">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools can register with the PAT Marking website, which already houses PAT:Mathematics and PAT:Reading Comprehension and Vocabulary. Teachers enter student answers on the data-entry page, giving them immediate access to an array of individual and group reports.</p>
<p class="num">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools can send in completed answer sheets to NZCER. The answer sheets are marked by scanner, the data validated and the results uploaded to the website, giving teachers access to an array of individual and group reports.</p>
<p class="noindent">The development of PAT:Listening Comprehension has involved a large commitment of time and resources. Central to this has been the participation of teachers and students in trials, and in advice and consultation roles. We are very grateful for the support that schools provide. We are excited about this new development and believe that the new PAT:Listening Comprehension will prove to be a useful and important assessment tool.</p>
