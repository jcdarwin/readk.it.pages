<p class="noindent1"><span class="span">T</span>he theme for this final issue of <i><b>set</b></i> for 2010 is &#8220;Teachers as learners&#8221;. Rhys Hill and Alison Sewell addresses the question: How can teachers change their engagement from traditional one-sided pedagogies to include a sociocultural approach? Their article describes one teacher&#8217;s journey as he engaged in collaborative action research.</p>
<p class="indent">Hornby High School invited a Teaching and Learning Research Initiative project to participate in their programme to establish &#8220;teachers as learners&#8221;, including holding a professional learning day that challenged teachers to reflect on their underlying assumptions about knowledge and learning. The activities from the day and some of the teachers&#8217; responses are described by Vanessa Andreotti and Karen Wheeler.</p>
<p class="indent">In the third article on the theme of &#8220;Teachers as learners&#8221;, Douglas Ferry asks the question: What do student teachers learn from their students? The study described in this article sought to examine the teaching experiences of a group of student teachers through their eyes, with a focus on what they thought they had learnt from the students they taught.</p>
<h2 class="left">Retirement of Bev Webber</h2>
<p class="noindent">After 15 years managing NZCER&#8217;s publishing programme, Bev Webber recently retired from the position of Publishing Manager of NZCER Press. During that time Bev built NZCER into a significant educational publisher and was instrumental in the establishment of the NZCER Press imprint in 2000. Bev oversaw the launch of three new educational journals (<i>Curriculum Matters</i>, <i>Assessment Matters</i> and the <i>Early Childhood Folio</i>) and helped develop <i><b>set</b></i> into the leading educational research publication it is today. In Bev&#8217;s time at NZCER she managed the publication of well over 100 research-based works, including journals, books, tests and reports. Bev mentored many fledgling educational researchers through the publication process. Her contribution to the publication of educational research was huge and she&#8217;ll be greatly missed.</p>
<h2 class="left"><i><b>set</b></i> is going digital</h2>
<p class="noindent">In response to keen interest from many readers, an online subscription to <i><b>set</b></i> is planned for release in 2011. Online subscribers will have access to current and back issues via the NZCER website. Articles will be available in fully searchable PDF format so that you can read <i><b>set</b></i> on screen, download articles or print them for later reading. Information about this and other planned developments, including the launch of many of our titles in e-book format, will be available on the NZCER Press website (<a href="http://www.nzcer.org.nz/nzcerpress">www.nzcer.org.nz/nzcerpress</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">If you have any suggestions about the design of <i><b>set</b></i> online or any other ideas about how we can make <i><b>set</b></i> better, please contact us at <a href="mailto:set@nzcer.org.nz">set@nzcer.org.nz</a></p>
