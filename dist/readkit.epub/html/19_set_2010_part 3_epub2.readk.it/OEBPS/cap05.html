<p class="noindent">What are the conditions required for standards to not only be used to measure improvement but also to inform student learning and teaching for improvement purposes in the context of national curriculum and assessment reform? (Klenowski &#38; Wyatt-Smith, 2010, p. 108)</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Isn&#8217;t this what you might call a &#8220;million dollar&#8221; question? Many New Zealand schools are currently facing this challenge and asking questions such as this with good reason. The question is posed here by two Australians, and addressed in the light of their experiences with Queensland&#8217;s New Basics project. In this commentary I plan to draw on their experiences, as well as a few of my own, and relate these to concerns about the implementation of the New Zealand National Standards.</p>
<p class="indent">A recent New Zealand Council for Educational Research (NZCER) conference explored issues associated with adult learning of foundational literacy and numeracy skills. During the lunch break I chatted with one participant who taught &#8220;embedded&#8221; literacy skills: the intended learning was part and parcel of routine training in work activities. For this tutor, one big advantage of embedding foundational learning was that the learner need not know literacy was the intended learning focus. &#8220;We don&#8217;t tell them they need literacy skills. They would be really upset&#8221; was the general tenor of the comment. While I can understand why someone might hold this view, it struck me as being a bit like not telling a person they have a life-threatening illness; in other words, treating it as a secret to be tiptoed around. The person who is the subject of the secret usually knows anyway, and often colludes in keeping silent about it. The underlying assumption appears to be that poor literacy skills in adults are something to be ashamed of and kept hidden, rather than a learning opportunity not yet realised, for whatever reason. It seems to me that a similar assumption could underlie the concern that telling a family their child is &#8220;below the standard&#8221; will mark them out as a failure at school and hence become a self-fulfilling label of failure. I don&#8217;t doubt that this <i>could</i> happen, especially if parents read the reporting signals in ways that simply make them anxious, without any accompanying sense that the situation can and should be proactively addressed. To avoid this &#8220;worst of possible outcomes&#8221; teachers and parents need to work together, with the support of government agencies, to collectively rethink some attitudes about learning and learners that seem to be common currency in our communities.</p>
<p class="indent">Let me contrast the conference anecdote above with another. While <i>The New Zealand Curriculum</i> (Ministry of Education, 2007) was in its final stages of development, a team of NZCER researchers did some work for the Ministry of Education on how the key competencies were being understood and used in so-called &#8220;early adopter&#8221; schools. One of my colleagues was enchanted by a five-year-old she met in one of the primary classrooms she visited. This young learner was obviously having her struggles with some text decoding skills and she could describe both the issue and the way she was working on it. Referencing her progress to the colours of the Ready to Read books, she explained how she had needed to work on a tricky skill in order to move forward. Having done this successfully gave her obvious satisfaction. She was confident, engaged and appeared to have no sense at all of being a struggling reader compared to her peers who were moving more quickly through the colour series. A <i>learning-to-learn</i> focus was evident in this class&#8212;something the teachers worked hard to keep out in the open as an expected and highly valued aspect of school life. Learning challenges were not hidden away but confronted, proactively addressed, surmounted and celebrated. The <i>attitudes</i> of the teachers and students as they confronted and addressed learning challenges were part of this carefully cultivated learning-to-learn ethos that pervaded the school.</p>
<p class="indent">What was already happening back then (in this and similar schools) resonates with the advice more recently given to the Ministry of Education in the commissioned paper <i>Directions for Assessment in New Zealand</i> (DANZ) (Absolum, Flockton, Hattie, Hipkins, &#38; Reid, 2009). DANZ identified the full involvement of students in learning conversations based around their <i>assessment</i>, as well as their learning, as a pivotal aspect of changing pedagogy in ways that successfully raise achievement levels in our schools. The ministry has subsequently taken that advice and produced an overarching policy document that attempts to spell out how this ideal might be achieved (Ministry of Education, 2010). According to this document, assessment results should be out in the open and their <i>meaning</i> for ongoing learning should be the focus of the conversations that ensue. The active role of parents in these conversations is emphasised. How might the National Standards fit in with this ideal? Can we make the various aspects of the National Standards policy work to a <i>learning</i> agenda and if so what would we need to do? A learning agenda would mean being prepared to learn from use of the National Standards, but also willing to revise their framing if need be.</p>
<p class="indent">The great appeal of the Ready to Read colour series is that deep professional expertise is built into the colour code and hence assessment and learning occur <i>together</i> as the child interacts with the text. This built-in assessment code can be read at a surface level or a deep one. The former may reassure parents about progress, or it might make them more anxious! Either way it potentially contributes to the <i>partnership</i> purpose of the standards, but the outcomes are unlikely to be positive if heightened anxiety is the main result. A deeper reading of the meaning of the colour code is essential for teachers if they are to be deliberate about meeting the <i>learning</i> purposes for assessment. Teachers who can access this meaning behind the surface assessment will be better placed to ensure that any subsequent conversations with parents focus on learning opportunities, not just achievement problems. There are obvious implications for teacher professional learning and support.</p>
<p class="indent">In summary, teachers could act on &#8220;assessment&#8221; information generated via the daily reading programme by:</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noting issues with a child&#8217;s progress but not tell the parents of any concerns for fear of making the parents&#8212; and the child&#8212;anxious (the equivalent of hiding the illness, as described above)</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reporting progress concerns to the parents by making comparisons to other students (as, for example, in the idea encompassed in the phrase &#8220;below the standard&#8221;) but then continue much as before</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;openly discussing learning challenges and next steps (as per the example above) and work on addressing these proactively.</p>
<p class="noindent">All of these options have consequences. The second option has been the specific focus of concern about &#8220;labelling&#8221; children, and it clearly has the potential to be damaging to motivation to keep learning. The first approach is also potentially damaging, albeit in a more hidden way. How can we compute the cost of learning opportunities that <i>don&#8217;t</i> get taken up when learning difficulties are carefully disguised for fear of causing harm? There is a tightrope to be walked here between the specific identification of learning challenges (in order to address them) and recognition that learning is complex and progress is not linear. However, if we tip the balance towards being too &#8220;fuzzy&#8221;, no matter that we have good reason in view of the complexity of &#8220;progress&#8221;, we risk missing opportunities to proactively address potential roadblocks to ongoing learning before they become entrenched obstacles that are more difficult to address. Very broad achievement objectives that leave large degrees of latitude for assessing actual performances could be seen as instances of this challenge. The National Standards potentially present new opportunities because they do describe some important aspects of actual learning progress much more specifically. But I have some important qualifiers to add.</p>
<p class="indent">Some very specific conditions do need to come together for <i>reporting</i> to parents to result in positive <i>learning</i> outcomes for children. It seems to me that all the rhetoric around the standards initiative rather takes some crucial steps for granted. It is far from self-evident that increased achievement will flow as a benefit from plain language reporting against the standards, no matter how parents react to the messages they receive. Obviously everyone involved needs to understand that enhancing and supporting ongoing learning <i>really is</i> the intended outcome. The attitudes to learning that we convey are important here, as is the language we use. Distilling their knowledge of how the New Basics standards played out in Queensland, the Australian researchers suggested all of the following considerations should be addressed (Klenowski &#38; Wyatt-Smith, 2010):</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>What we mean by the word</b> <i>standard</i> <b>needs to be clear and consistent</b>. The meaning can slip between being a pejorative judgement (for example, &#8220;below standard&#8221; meaning &#8220;not good enough&#8221;) and being specific about an expectation (for example, &#8220;what it is helpful to have learned by this stage&#8221;). As I have noted in an earlier discussion of the issues, the language used to discuss educational matters needs constant critical scrutiny (Hipkins, 2010). It is important to keep everyone&#8217;s focus on the learning potential of standards to avoid harmful labelling of children.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Any standards used need to be</b> <i>milestones</i> <b>not one-off arbiters of quality</b> (as in national testing). There must be room for <i>all</i> children to show their progress, and for this to be appropriately acknowledged. Our National Standards describe a possible continuum of progress, but anchoring their descriptions to linear expectations of age-or year-level-related progress, with associated comparative judgments (&#8220;below the standard&#8221;) can mean they are seen as arbiters of quality. We need to find ways to keep the reporting focus on every student&#8217;s actual learning gains, without in the process giving some parents the idea that we are avoiding questions of relative success. At the time of writing this commentary the NZCER standards team was working on a discussion paper that addresses the complexities of this challenge.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The &#8220;standard&#8221; needs to be populated with rich professional insights.</b> These are most effectively generated through carefully designed and well-resourced moderation procedures. Klenowski and Wyatt-Smith are very clear on this point, and they talk about the &#8220;pedagogical possibilities&#8221; that accumulate as teachers use standards to support learning. Might this be a useful catchphrase for us in New Zealand? A standard is a <i>collective</i> and needs to be owned and tended as such by the professionals who are expected to be the change agents in education. Again this is an area where NZCER is planning ongoing work.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>It is important to leave space for teachers to bring their tacit knowledge of children, curriculum and contexts into the open during acts of judging</b>. The strong message here is that assessment <i>always</i> has subjective elements and indeed <i>should</i> have subjective elements grounded in assessors&#8217; professional expertise. Even seemingly objective events, such as tests, must reside in judgements about what it is appropriate to assess and how this can best be done. We as a profession have work to do to help others understand the inevitable subjectivities of assessment, and how these are managed to ensure fairness to those assessed&#8212;in other words, that validity and reliability are proactively considered and addressed. From the rhetoric that is about in the media, and based on my experiences of researching the implementation of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), I think we have a real challenge on our hands here (Hipkins, 2010). This challenge won&#8217;t go away and the cost of not addressing it openly will be a further erosion of trust in teachers as learning professionals.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klenowski and Wyatt-Smith are also very clear that <b>those who hold teachers accountable should be very cautious about using the results of standards-related assessments for the purpose of regulating teachers&#8217; work</b>, or for promoting competition between schools (for example, via league table publication). They say that the balance should always tip to the <i>improvement</i> function of standards, and this seems to me to be a good rule of thumb for our decision making and actions. Normative comparisons have been the currency of education reporting for over a century, whether of schools, teachers or individual students. Such comparisons are so familiar that it is inevitable there will be some community and parental suspicion of approaches that seek to contextualise and personalise assessment and reporting (again we can learn from NCEA here). The proof of the efficacy of assessment and reporting changes must reside in a convincing demonstration of <i>learning gains</i>, for <i>all</i> students.</p>
<p class="noindent">On that note I want to end by widening the focus of concern beyond struggling learners, turning my attention to those children who are likely to always be &#8220;above the standard&#8221;. At the 2010 NZCER conference, my colleague Charles Darr introduced a computer adaptive assessment tool, commissioned by the Tertiary Education Commission for use in assessing the learning of adults in foundational literacy and numeracy. Because they take the assessment online, learners only see one question at a time. If the items they tackle are easy for them (they get most or all of the first few correct) the test adapts by offering more challenging items. The reverse happens when test takers struggle and get few items correct. There is an important <i>informational</i> reason for making these adaptations to formal tests. Getting everything correct arguably tells us even less about next learning challenges than getting most things wrong! Assessment is most useful when it identifies <i>both</i> successes and next challenges.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking this example and applying it to the reporting of National Standards, we could ponder learning-to-learn challenges for students who consistently make progress &#8220;above the standard&#8221;. As Guy Claxton has pointed out repeatedly, students who are accustomed to thinking about themselves as bright and quick, and learning as easy and relatively effortless, are quite likely to lack the resilience they will eventually need when learning challenges do come their way (Claxton, 2008). We saw some indications of this in the recent Lifelong Literacy project, which explored the intersection of key competencies and learning to read (Twist &#38; McDowall, 2010). In one school, students who were used to being first off the mark with the &#8220;right&#8221; answer became uncomfortable during conversations that invited different interpretations of the meaning of a text. They appeared not to have the learning resilience to cope with the uncertainties of &#8220;interpretive space&#8221;, yet creating such space was the very thing that enabled rich learning-to-learn conversations for other students.</p>
<p class="indent">To sum up, what I&#8217;m suggesting in this commentary is that we could use concerns about the reporting of National Standards as an opportunity to rethink our beliefs and attitudes about what constitutes &#8220;good&#8221; learning for students of all abilities, and to bring learning-to-learn conversations into the open. Compared to our own typical experiences of school and of learning, this is a sea change. School professionals must lead the way, but families also need to be involved or the risk of children being &#8220;labelled&#8221; will not go away. <i>Learning to learn</i> is one of the eight principles of <i>The New Zealand Curriculum</i> (Ministry of Education, 2007), so this challenge needs to be addressed as part of the curriculum implementation. None of what I have said obviates the need for collectively working through other areas of concern about the National Standards, but this is one issue we can all address proactively, in ways that support the best interests of all our students and the school community.</p>
