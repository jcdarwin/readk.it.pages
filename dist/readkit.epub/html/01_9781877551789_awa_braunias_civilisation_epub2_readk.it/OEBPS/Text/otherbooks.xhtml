  <p class="first-para">The Dominion Post: Best Non-Fiction of 2007</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-para">Prize-winning journalist Steve Braunias is standing on the balcony of an inner-city apartment on a sultry summer evening when a black-backed gull flies so close he is instantaneously bowled over with happiness. ‘I thought: Birds, everywhere. I want to know more about them.’ This highly engaging book is the result &ndash; a personal journey into an amazing world. It’s also a New Zealand history, a geographical wandering, and an affectionate look at the tribe of people ensnared, captivated and entranced by birds.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-para">‘Braunias has touchingly brought love and bird-watching together in a book that stalks sewage ponds and grey warblers with curiosity and affection, and ends with contentment, bliss and a baby born. A lovely book’</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-para">Whether gently but firmly lambasting airhead politicians, unrepentant murderers, apostrophe vigilantes, literary poseurs, or the purveyors of awful food, Steve Braunias shows his exceptional mastery of the art of column writing. But this winner of over 20 writing awards is also a passionate New Zealander, who has become famous for his tender evocations of the country’s heart-tugging landscapes, chequered history, and spirited population.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-para">‘Typically quirky, honest and a pleasure to read. …There is not much writing like Braunias’s in New Zealand. <span class="italic">Smoking in Antarctica</span> is a wonderful collection to keep around &ndash; in the car for brief moments while waiting, in the beach bag to dip into between swims. Or by the bed, on top of Braunias’s other books, all of which have proved as timeless as this one will’</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-para">Steve Braunias’s satirical and closely observed writings have driven readers to drink, God, lawyers, and sometimes to the shops to shower him with gifts. In this lascivious selection he addresses the state of New Zealand steak, the beauty of mangroves, the lunacy of film festivals, the attractions of small towns (‘There is no statistic that says a village can accommodate only one village idiot’), the charms of Cambridge University and the strange habits of the English, and more &ndash; as well as his own intimate, seesawing, surprisingly vulnerable life as a writer and lovestruck father.</p>
