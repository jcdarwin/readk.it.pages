  <p class="heading1">Hicks Bay</p>

  <p class="heading2">A Brief History of Meat</p>

  <p class="first-para">There was an old man who lived at the edge of the world. ‘When I look back on my life,’ Lance Roberts said, ‘I’ve done a lot of killing.’</p>

  <p>I met him at his monstrous house. Someone had once written that they heard screams and bleats there on still nights. Outside, the long horizontal line of the blue Pacific looked sharp as a knife. The blade flashed in the bright sun. It cut the sky in half.</p>

  <p>‘Good on you, boy,’ Lance said with real enthusiasm whenever I did something as incredible as pass the sugar. There were bones in the ashes of his woodstove. He lit the stove with chainsaw shavings and put on the kettle. It was late summer.</p>

  <p>Small, nimble, in gumboots and an oily jersey, he had approximately one yellow tooth left in his old bristled head, and his voice croaked from a swamp inside his throat. He was about to turn 85. When I first saw him he was sitting outside at the top of his wooden staircase and something like ten or eleven cats had formed an orderly queue to take food from his mouth. His hands were black. So was his neck. It was moot when he had last changed his clothes or showered, but Lance didn’t live in civilisation. The deserted shoreline, driftwood tipping out of the surf &ndash; you could buy a car for an ounce of dope in the East Coast village of Hicks Bay, where Lance lived in a kind of converted loft.</p>

  <p>Hicks Bay was a long line of sand beneath high green hills. It had a shop. Across the road there was a bus shelter and a stack of firewood. It had a road. There was a sign in front of a house that read NO TURNING ON THE FUCKING LAWN. Two other words had been painted over. ‘They were a lot worse,’ said the woman who lived next door. There was a two-litre plastic bottle filled with water on top of a fence post at the cemetery for visitors to wash their hands.</p>

  <p>A river beat a path through gorse and shingle; Lance’s peculiar home was on the other side of the riverbank. He boiled the kettle and recited terrible verse. ‘The clock of life is wound but once,’ he said. He’d committed the poem to memory. ‘And no man has the power to say just when the hands will stop.’</p>

  <p>The old and almost toothless head, the cup of tea and plate of Cameo Cremes &ndash; he wept when he talked about how his father had found relief work building a railroad in the Great Depression and secretly opened up a Post Office savings bank account in Lance’s name. ‘I always think of the past,’ he said. ‘As far back as I can remember my mother used to carry me on her back in her shawl. She’d go out looking for pūhā and watercress, and when she’d bend over to pick up this stuff I was that fearful of falling out of the shawl I used to cry me bloody head off.’</p>

  <p>And then he said, ‘I was about six when she died. I’m not too sure what happened. I think she ended up with pleurisy or something. She was always looking for mussels in cold bloody weather: that’s probably what done for her. Yeah.’</p>

  <p>The warmth of the fire, the gummy voice &ndash; he had a high yapping laugh and a big cut on the back of his head. He didn’t know how it’d got there. He searched a drawer for one of his most prized possessions, his knife. It had a wooden handle. The blade was sharp and clean. It looked good in his grip, the way it rested in his palm. I tried to imagine him using it. Later that afternoon, a man in a caravan would give him the opportunity.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-para">I went to Hicks Bay because no one went there. For three years, whenever I could, I went to places no one went to, drawn to their averageness, their nothingness, their banal and exhilarating New Zealandness. I went to the damp Wellington town of Wainuiomata, to the vigilant Otago town of Mosgiel, to Mercer, Greymouth, Collingwood and Tangimoana, to 20 places: small towns, unremarkable suburbs, frozen bases and equatorial outposts, in the country, in the cities, out of the country altogether, wherever there was any sign of New Zealand civilisation.</p>

  <p>I chose them at random. I’d look at a map and say out loud, ‘There.’ People said, ‘Where?’ The next question they asked was, ‘Why?’ They especially asked that in the places themselves. They couldn’t believe anyone would find where they lived of any interest.</p>

  <p>But I wanted to go and live in just about every one. I adored the qualities of silence, the sunlight on fence posts, the sound of river water on rock. I wanted to belong, to be part of the established order of the town clock and the menswear store, the main street deserted by six p.m., the cat curled up on the windowsill.</p>

  <p>I arrived without any exact purpose. I spoke to anyone who had the time. I asked about their everyday life and took note of everyday objects. I craved the normal but I seemed to spend a lot of time visiting people living in abodes as weird as caves. They were sometimes damaged people, often solitary, always resourceful. They hung on in there.</p>

  <p>New Zealand did the same. The country was broke. It drank at home and read Dan Brown. Its bum looked big: McDonald’s registered record sales. It filled the supermarket trolley with Home Brand and Pam’s. It bought Christmas presents at the $2 Shop, and put up the same signs over and over: SPACE TO LEASE; EVERYTHING MUST GO; WINZ QUOTES. There was a change of government and nothing changed. Ordinary people living in ordinary homes, bringing up the kids and bringing in the washing, getting on with the uncelebrated business of being New Zealanders in an economic slump.</p>

  <p>The recession haunted every place I went, even the end of the world &ndash; Scott Base, Antarctica. One day I saw a week-old copy of <span class="italic">The Press</span> lying on a table in the games room. The front-page headline read MORE JOBS TO GO.</p>

  <p>More jobs did go. That was very often decided in a head office across the Tasman; it was as though Australia had foreclosed on New Zealand. Australia, always Australia, constant and flush with confidence, wealth, warmer temperatures. New Zealanders left in their droves for an apparently better life &ndash; higher wages, less self-loathing. The two most important statistics in New Zealand life became the number of people who left for Australia every month, and the holiday road toll.</p>

  <p>For three years New Zealand toughed it out, switching off the lights to save power, waiting for better times. It sometimes felt as though it had gone missing. In limbo, it stuck its head in, passed the Home Brand salt and watched <span class="italic">Fair Go</span>. It said, ‘Whatevs.’</p>

  <p>The age of austerity suited the country, with its cherished notions of modesty and endurance. Author Jonathan Raban has written of his homeland: ‘Like all small islands, England has got into the singular habit of thinking itself enormous, continental.’ Not all small islands: New Zealand thinks itself smaller than it is, a buried treasure, X marks the spot. It constantly talks of being put on the map, as though waiting to be discovered and rediscovered.</p>

  <p>It constantly talks about itself. Oliver Duff, in his 1941 book <span class="italic">New Zealand Now</span>: ‘A land lying so far from the controlling centres of the world that no one but its own people take it seriously.’ Austin Mitchell, in his 1972 book <span class="italic">The Half-Gallon Quarter-Acre Pavlova Paradise</span>: ‘As a country, New Zealand has one major preoccupation: New Zealand.’</p>

  <p>The ancient studies have set the tone, created the foundation myth of New Zealanders as conformist, afraid of something, defensive and belligerent. ‘A queer, lost, eccentric people,’ John Mulgan wrote in his 1947 essay ‘Report on Experience’. Bill Pearson in his 1952 essay ‘Fretful Sleepers’ wondered ‘if it isn’t death the New Zealander waits for’. And: ‘Who is he trying to fool, to reassure,’ American visitor Robin Winks asked in his 1954 book <span class="italic">These New Zealanders</span>, ‘with his band-beating and horn-tooting?’</p>

  <p>Civic pride is easily offended. National pride is at stake every minute of the day. Personal reputations can be destroyed in a trice. In 2011 prime minister John Key gave this chilling assessment: ‘Everyone is accountable for everything they say.’ Someone is always listening, waiting for the chance to purse their lips in disapproval.</p>

  <p>Anything else? Yes. We drink too much, drive too fast, and let mad dogs off the leash. Our national pastimes are golf, drowning, and child abuse. Also, we moan and bitch and complain about everything. Poor old New Zealand, driven mad by the voices in its head.</p>

  <p>I hit the road for those three years to get away from it all. I kept finding deep signs of happiness. Everyday life rose above the recession and the claims made for New Zealand’s apparent despair. As I wandered from no place special to no other place special I kept seeing an explicit New Zealand contentment, at lakeside and riverside, in the middle of arid plains, in the middle of polluted suburbs, in an ingeniously converted slaughterhouse loft.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-para">Lance used to work as a slaughterman at the freezing works along the coast at Tokomaru Bay. They issued him with three knives. One he later gave to a mate and never got back. Another he lost in a river. The knife he kept was as valuable as a historical document.</p>

  <p>A brief history of meat: One of the most profound dates in New Zealand civilisation is February 15, 1882, when a maiden voyage of frozen meat left Port Chalmers in Dunedin for England. The inventory included 2,226 sheep tongues &ndash; if only those tongues could talk. England soon clamoured for the various cuts of chop, brisket, rib and liver, leading to an industrial revolution in the new colony. By the time the freezing works at Hicks Bay opened in 1921, there were already four other massive slaughterhouses operating in Poverty Bay. Meat was red gold, a recipe for success, a major new export commodity in addition to wool and grain.</p>

  <p>‘The new option radically changed the nature of farming in New Zealand,’ wrote historian Michael King. ‘Previously sheep farmers had been forced to slaughter animals &ndash; sometimes by simply driving them over cliffs. Now they could raise sheep for meat and wool … [It] would deliver to New Zealanders one of the highest living standards in the world.’</p>

  <p>Lance Roberts, 85 and fangy, survived as one of the architects of New Zealand. He was fifteen in 1941 when Oliver Duff wrote, ‘Have we a New Zealander? Is there one among us so typical of all that New Zealand comes and goes with him?’ Lance worked as a cowboy, station hand, fencer, farmer, shearer, killer. ‘I enjoyed it all. I was a fit bugger. I used to say to the young guys, “If I put my heart in your frame, it’d rattle it to pieces.”’ At Tokomaru Bay, slaughtermen had to account for 84 big sheep or 96 lambs in under seven and a half hours. What you needed to do, Lance explained, was kill with both hands.</p>

  <p>He looked back with pride on his 85 years. He’d broken the land, married three times, mastered the art of walking upright in New Zealand. He was its two races, its mixed blood. He said, ‘I’m not a full Pākehā, not a full Māori either. I’m a bit of each. That’s the best way to be.’</p>

  <p>His first horse was a chestnut pacer called Socks. He saw the great Australian aviator Charles Kingsford-Smith land his <span class="italic">Southern Cross</span> on the beach at Gisborne on a summer’s day in 1933 &ndash; he was across the road in a kind of orphanage, where he’d been placed after his mother died. His family of two sisters and two brothers were split up. His father taught him how to use explosives. Other men taught him plumbing, killing, shearing. ‘They were real good men. They looked after me.’ He wept at the memory, and said he thought about them in his bed every night.</p>

  <p>The past, mobilising in the dark, tapping his shoulder as he lay in bed &ndash; what was that about three wives? ‘I played up,’ he said. ‘If I couldn’t jump over the fence I’d crawl under it.’ There were dusty old black and white photos of him on the walls; he’d been a strapping young guy, with a barrel chest and a wide face. One big paw usually held an axe while the other curled around the shoulders of various lascivious broad-hipped women. I asked how many children he had. ‘I haven’t chased them through the gate to tally them,’ he said. ‘Oh hell, let me think. One, two, three … oooh hell … eight, nine…’ He wasn’t sure, but he thought there were fourteen.</p>

  <p>Memories of pūhā and watercress, women and children &ndash; his life was passing before him. It was a good life. He knew the East Coast like a room, knew its valleys and skies, knew how many miles of fence lines he’d dug with his bulldozer, how many sheep he’d sheared on the board. He knew who he was. He knew his facts. But it was news to him when I told him he occupied a unique place in New Zealand fiction. He lived in the ruins of the Hicks Bay freezing works, the setting of David Ballantyne’s 1968 novel <span class="italic">Sydney Bridge Upside Down</span>, a masterpiece right from its opening sentence: ‘There was an old man who lived on the edge of the world…’</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-para">Travelling south on State Highway 35 on a Friday in late summer was lovely and empty, full of sea and sun. There was a chestnut mare in the playground of an abandoned school, a black bull in the shade of the only tree for miles, road signs advising WANDERING STOCK PHONE 0800 444449. A tattooed Māori man and his blonde 17-year-old girlfriend, who wore cut-off shorts and red nail polish, prepared to head for the hills, where they cultivated a dope plantation. Yellow cornfields peeled in the heat. Washing hung over fences.</p>

  <p>In Hicks Bay no one was around, except for a girl smoking in the doorway of the store. Pears from an overhanging tree lay scattered in long grass and wasps crawled inside the white mushy flesh. ‘I haven’t been there since 1978, when Dad &amp; Mum &amp; my little son drove down to Wgtn via Dad’s landmarks in my car,’ Stephen Ballantyne wrote to me. ‘Dad showed us the shack where he lived. Looked like a big chicken coop.’</p>

  <p>His dad David spent five years of his childhood in Hicks Bay, which he renamed and reimagined in <span class="italic">Sydney Bridge Upside Down</span> as Calliope Bay. It’s the only place name in the book: one of the small, crucial achievements of the novel is that there’s absolutely no reference to New Zealand. His book is set free, rids itself of New Zealand, and travels only in the mind of its protagonist, schoolboy Harry Baird, who tells of what happened at Calliope Bay one particular summer.</p>

  <p>Another narrative of Hicks Bay is played out in the <span class="italic">Papers Past</span> archive, which records that the two most important subjects in the town’s history are death and meat. Newspaper report, August 12, 1897: ‘A Māori woman named Kamiera committed suicide at Hicks Bay by hanging herself to a tree.’ July 23, 1921: ‘J Lamb, aged 60, whilst working at Hicks Bay, met with a fatal accident, a large boulder rolling on him.’ Headline, December 16, 1919: PROPOSED FREEZING WORKS AT HICKS BAY. August 27, 1920: ‘Considerable damage was caused to the construction of the Hicks Bay freezing works when a fierce hurricane lasting over an hour was experienced at midnight.’ October 14, 1921: ‘The first shipment of meat from the new freezing works at Hicks Bay is being made by the steamer <span class="italic">Kumara</span>.’</p>

  <p>All that red gold shining in the refrigerated holds, five slaughterhouses, an industrial revolution on the shores of the Pacific &ndash; all that promise and wealth to be delivered by meat. But the golden age was brief. Sheridan Gundry chronicles the rise and fall in <span class="italic">Making a Killing: A history of the Gisborne&ndash;East Coast freezing works industry</span>. She writes of the excitement and optimism as money was raised for the Hicks Bay meatworks; the problems with building a suitable wharf &ndash; the first attempt was battered by heavy seas and the pilings collapsed; the great Māori leader Āpirana Ngata naming the new wharf Hinemaurea after a great ancestress. The wharf had tram tracks, a locomotive. In the spirit of the times when New Zealanders gathered to celebrate the opening of an eyelid, it was opened ‘amid fanfare’ on April 14, 1925.</p>

  <p>The meatworks closed down the next year. The business was no longer feasible and perhaps never really had been. Access to Hicks Bay was difficult, and the price for New Zealand meat had begun to plummet in 1921, the year the works opened. As Lance put it, ‘The guts fell out of it.’</p>

  <p>The building was stripped of machinery, fittings, even the roof. It was already a ruin when David Ballantyne came to live in its shadow. The long summers of childhood, the crash of the ocean, the secret caves, the thrill and menace of the roofless crumbling meatworks &ndash; something took hold in his imagination, and was still there when he set to work on <span class="italic">Sydney Bridge Upside Down</span>, which he began writing in 1966 when he returned to New Zealand after working as a journalist in London.</p>

  <p>Ballantyne was a drunk &ndash; the first thing he did when he got back to New Zealand was go on the piss &ndash; but he was also, for a time, in possession of genius. His friend Bryan Reid writes in his sympathetic biography <span class="italic">After the Fireworks</span>: ‘He was not yet so gripped by alcohol that his talent was impaired. … As he banged away on the typewriter, [his wife] Vivien could actually hear her husband singing at his work. He would have known he was producing something special.’</p>

  <p>Singing! Ballantyne himself said of <span class="italic">Sydney Bridge Upside Down</span>: ‘It was meant as a Gothic joke.’ Whatever that means. It’s a creepy, brooding, harrowing book, full of screams and scones, threat and sex. ‘Not a single thing in the novel is original,’ Patrick Evans marvels in <span class="italic">The Penguin History of New Zealand Literature</span>. ‘Least original of all is the novel’s sad, last-childhood-of-summer feeling, whose lamenting note sounds through so much New Zealand writing &ndash; but in Ballantyne’s hands everything is new and intense, made over as if being explored for the very first time.’</p>

  <p>It’s a summer of sensual childish delight &ndash; the passionfruit vines choking everything in their path, the pots of rich sticky plum jam, the precious bottles of home-made ginger beer. Harry and his friends play in caves and on the wharf. Things only appear innocent. Things are not right. Harry’s neighbour makes one of the most dazzling speeches in New Zealand literature:</p>

  <p>When people first came to Calliope Bay, what troubled them most was loneliness. I don’t mean the people in the very old days, the first one or two who farmed in the district before there was any sort of settlement. I mean those who came to build the works, then those who came because there were jobs for them at the works, then those … who came to help pull down the works. All these people were very lonely for a time. They seemed so far, far away from everything. No part of the country, of the world even, seems so far away as this. And when people are faraway and lonely they often behave curiously, this is well-known.</p>

  <p>The speech is a warning. Calliope Bay is falling apart. There is a mysterious house without windows, also a broken-down windmill. Most potently and savagely, there are the ruins of the meatworks. Ballantyne sent the book in drafts to Frank Sargeson, who loved it, noting, ‘It’s a very brilliant idea using the meatworks ruin as a kind of Mrs Radcliffe’s castle.’</p>

  <p>The meatworks is the star of the book, its metaphor of death. Harry plays in it and says, ‘You can imagine all the big killers busy with their knives. … Even now, when you walk across those concrete floors, you can imagine stains, and some days I’ve heard squeals and groans below me and I’ve thought this is not the wind I can hear.’</p>

  <p>Death and sex and loneliness, distance, madness, cruelty, the slowly drained cargo of ginger beer &ndash; the whole book is an electrifying New Zealand classic, timeless. It doesn’t matter when it was written. When it was published in 1968, it sank like a rock. It was reissued in 2010 and sank like a rock all over again.</p>

  <p>‘First I’ve heard of it,’ said Lance, the tenant of a metaphor. I wandered inside the ruins for those three days, happy and delighted to be there, a pilgrim on a literary pilgrimage. I wasn’t the first. Stephen Ballantyne told me, ‘James Ashcroft, artistic director of Taki Rua, went to Hicks Bay for his honeymoon last year for the same reason.’</p>

  <p>Calliope Bay, Hicks Bay &ndash; it was all the same. There was the wharf, which appeared to have bullet holes in a sign reading HAZARDOUS AREA. WHARF COLLAPSE COULD ENDANGER USERS. VISITORS USE AT THEIR OWN RISK. The pilings looked as weak as twigs. I walked out to the edge, over the deep water where boats had once been filled with meat bound for England. Shags roosted in a tree hanging on to a cliff, and dived in the sea. A thunderstorm was approaching; violent waves pushed and jostled each other as they attacked the shore.</p>

  <p>There were the remains of the tram tracks, and a long dark cave, possibly the one Ballantyne had Harry Baird play in. I crawled inside the dank cobwebby hole, touched the ferns that grew on the floor, and listened to the sea boom low and deep.</p>

  <p>There was the bridge stained with blackberries, and the Wharekāhika River, which ran past the meatworks, took its blood out to sea.</p>

  <p>And there, more than anything, looming over everything, were the ruins of the meatworks. They were immense. It was impossible to know what you were even looking at because there was so much going on &ndash; big fat black pigs snorting at your feet, chickens and roosters scratching in the dirt, a trailer full of pumpkins, and the sheer size of the ruins. Timber and machinery took up the ground floor. Lance had fashioned a kind of apartment on the first floor. It used to be the sorting room: he slept where the offal was stacked, bathed where the livers were separated, cooked where the lungs had stopped breathing.</p>

  <p>There were rough strips of carpet on the concrete floor in the kitchen. The rooms went on and on &ndash; there were a couple of empty fridges and one with a flounder in it. Everywhere there were thick columns of reinforced concrete. The pillars and arches and high roof made the place feel like a castle, or some kind of demonic cathedral. But it was just Lance’s home.</p>

  <p>He bought it in 1984 for $25,000. He’d been farming nearby on a 21-year lease from Māori Affairs. ‘I had to go somewhere when the lease ran out. I certainly wasn’t going into town. Luckily I heard about this place. I had a mate tell me about it. I thought, this’ll do me.</p>

  <p>‘There’s 69 acres. I own the lot, right down to the beach. I cut it all up into seven paddocks, planted all the trees you can see. It was a total bloody shambles when I come here, but it didn’t worry me. I had all the know-how and gear to bloody knock it into shape. The other buggers that had it before me, they never done a thing to it. Hopeless bloody cases. Lawyers. There was blackberry and woolly nightshade and every bloody thing you can put a name to.’</p>

  <p>We were drinking tea in the kitchen. Lance said, ‘I bet you’d like to go up on the roof, wouldn’t you, boy.’ Boy, 51, followed him to a wall where he’d stacked chairs, cupboards and various other pieces of furniture to form a ladder. At the top a manhole led to the top floor of the meatworks; just the walls were left, and gaping holes where the windows had been.</p>

  <p>‘There was so much bloody rubbish growing up here,’ he said. ‘Trees growing out of the bloody roof! And bloody cannabis. It took me a bloody week to clear all this bloody stuff off. I brought a wheelbarrow and a shovel up here, filled it with load after load, and then I dug a big hole with the excavator and buried the lot.’</p>

  <p>There were lids on the chutes where the big killers with knives used to dispose of offal. There were runnels for blood. Lance had put in a chimney, and a tank for his spring water. ‘Here,’ he said, and passed the hose over. It was possibly the best water in New Zealand. ‘You might be right about that, boy,’ he said, ‘and it’s been flowing like that since the day I put it in. Seven hundred and fifty bloody gallons in 24 hours, just from that constant trickle.’ He pointed to the spur of rock across the road. ‘That’s where the spring is. I dug the pipe two feet deep. Did it all with a bloody pick and spade.’</p>

  <p>There was the river, the beach, the wharf. We looked out over the paddocks. ‘All that was bloody swamp and bog. The bloody mosquitoes would carry you out of bed, that’s how bad it was. But I’ll tell you something, boy. I’m not frightened of work. I worked like a dog on every place. I worked like a dog on the shearing boards. I worked like a dog in the freezing works.’</p>

  <p>The sun was high and warm as we stood together in the open air. Lance pointed to the ground we were standing on and said, ‘Here’s where the killing was done.’</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="first-para">Lance asked if I’d ever gone inside a meatworks. I told him about the time I went to the grassy Taranaki town of Eltham. The great warrior Tītokowaru passed through Eltham in 1869 and boasted, ‘I have begun to eat the flesh of the white man. I have eaten him like the flesh of the cow.’ It wouldn’t have tasted half as good as the flesh of the cattle slaughtered at the Riverlands freezing works, which produces top-quality export beef.</p>

  <p>I arrived on a morning in autumn. There were stretched cowhides on the walls in reception. Trucks and trailers pulled up in the yard; cattle were led out and hosed down. Inside the works, among the staff of 540 in white overalls and gumboots that had begun the day spotless but were now more red than white, I watched a cattle beast released into a narrow pen. A metal clamp seized its head. An electric plate rose up and delivered a short sharp volt. The beast collapsed; a door opened; the beast rolled through on its side and a halal slaughterman from Morocco slit its throat.</p>

  <p>First to go were its front hooves. A giant pair of scissors broke through the bone. A hook then hoisted the two-footed corpse in the air from its hind hoof. The skin was pulled off its face and the entire hide stripped &ndash; Riverlands has a contract to supply Air New Zealand with leather for seats in business class. The head was cut off.</p>

  <p>The foreman charged on with his tour. He’d seen it a thousand times before, and that was only yesterday: Riverlands had the capacity to butcher 1,250 cattle per day. ‘There’s our lung room,’ the foreman said. And: ‘This is the large intestine turned inside out. It goes to Korea.’ Also: ‘This is what we call the jawbreaker. He takes the jaw out, and makes it easier to get meat out of the head.’</p>

  <p>There were tables piled high with tongues, kidneys and hearts. There were red offal and green offal. There were the cattle beast’s four stomachs &ndash; the third is called the bible, because its flesh ripples like the pages of a book. And there, too, were first-class and delicious steaks, which I ate for lunch in the Riverlands’ boardroom.</p>

  <p>It was a memorable day. But it was even more vivid standing on top of the ruins at Hicks Bay and watching Lance re-enact where the killing was done. ‘There was a ramp just there,’ he said, pointing to the edge of the killing floor. ‘They’d bring the sheep up it. So what happens is, when you catch your sheep you dump it down against the pole there, and you grab its bloody head and pull it back and cut his throat with your bloody knee down on his head.</p>

  <p>‘As soon as you’ve done that one, you get the next one, and put it up hard against the first sheep you’ve killed. But you can cut the head clean off if you pull the knife too hard. That’s a bugger. You want the head on so you can put the boot down on it and pull out the brisket. That’s one of the tricks of the trade, you see.</p>

  <p>‘So after you’ve cut its throat you leg it up. You take the trotters off and hang it up on the hook and you pelt it off, and after you pelt it off you gut it out, and there’s the finished product…’</p>

  <p>All the while he was moving along the rooftop, a small and nimble old buzzard in his gumboots and ripped jersey and black neck, miming the slit of a throat and the pulling out of a brisket &ndash; he was bringing the dead back to life and killing them all over again. He was dragging New Zealand history out into the open.</p>

  <p>And then he snapped back to the present. A man called in on him on Saturday afternoon. ‘Got a goat for you, Lance,’ he said. His name was Rick and he’d parked up by the beach in his caravan. He said he’d been watching a fishing show on TV when he saw a flash of white in the bush. He grabbed his gun, rushed outside and shot the goat in the head. He hoped Lance could butcher it.</p>

  <p>We went out to the yard. There was the dead goat. Big flies had settled on its bloodied head. Lance got to work with his knife.</p>

  <p>‘You shot him in the right place, Rick. Good stuff, boy.’</p>

  <p>He took off the pelt.</p>

  <p>‘He’ll cook up well, that bloody goat.’</p>

  <p>He tied the goat’s insides into a knot.</p>

  <p>‘That’s so when you take the guts out, the liquid won’t run into the rib cage.’</p>

  <p>He cut the head off.</p>

  <p>‘Now I’ll do the bloody brisket.’</p>

  <p>He cut its legs off at the knee.</p>

  <p>‘It’s a bugger of a joint to find.’</p>

  <p>He hung it up on a hook, and got to work on the guts.</p>

  <p>‘Look at the bloody stomach bloat.’</p>

  <p>Rick said, ‘Sorry. Couldn’t get it to you any sooner, mate.’</p>

  <p>Lance said, ‘No, she’s right, Rick, she’s bang on. Just what the doctor ordered.’</p>

  <p>He took out three grey stomachs, and inspected his handiwork.</p>

  <p>‘Oh, that’s as rough as guts, Lance,’ he said to himself. ‘You’ll get the boot, boy. You’ll get the bloody boot.’</p>

  <p>Rick crouched at Lance’s feet, inspecting and admiring the work of the master. The pigs and cats snuffled closer as blood and bits of goat flesh fell from the hook into the grass; the butchery had taken place by the wing of the meatworks where Lance had been working on the engine of his beloved Komatsu bulldozer, which he’d bought in 1967 and still took out now and then to cut tracks for neighbours in return for firewood.</p>

  <p>The sun was sinking; there were long shadows, and the light in the sky was golden. It buttered the ruins, crept into Lance’s bedroom. He slept on a single mattress. The blankets were old and rough. He’d pinned photos of his past beside the bed. When night fell, he’d think about the men who looked after him when he left school at fourteen and went out into the world. He had been motherless almost his entire life.</p>

  <p>The shadows lengthened. The castle of the meatworks looked as dark as a tomb. Hicks Bay, Calliope Bay: like young Harry Baird, Lance hoarded a cargo of home-made ginger beer. He’d poured the precious fizz into about a dozen empty Sprite lemonade bottles and written the bottling date on each. They were on the floor of his bedroom. Outside, he completed his dismembering of the goat. The sharp knife doing its work, the goat in pieces on the grass, dinner ready to store in the fridge and freezer &ndash; I could have watched him all day.</p>
