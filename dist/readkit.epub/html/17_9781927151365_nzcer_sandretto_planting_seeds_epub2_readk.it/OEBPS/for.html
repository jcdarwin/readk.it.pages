<h1 class="center"><b>FOREWORD</b></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here is no official mandate to engage students in critical literacy practices in New Zealand. While the developers of the 1994 <i>English in the New Zealand Curriculum</i> had access to position papers on what a critical literacy approach might imply for curriculum development, the best they could manage was a single sentence in the introductory section on the &#8220;process strand&#8221;, &#8220;Thinking critically&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">They [the students] should reflect on the different social assumptions, judgments, and beliefs which are embodied in texts, and which different people bring to language and learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Someone put some care into the formulation of this sentence, since it was much stronger than the one that appeared in the first curriculum draft. Yet in the context of the curriculum document as mandated, it was buried and its implications unrealised.</p>
<p class="indent">The 2007 <i>National Curriculum</i> did nothing to change the situation. Nor, as Susan Sandretto has pointed out in this book, has the publication of two books on &#8220;effective literacy practice&#8221; in any marked way moved the focus on literacy instruction away from the individual and the cognitive towards a socio-cultural view of literacy as a repertoire of social practices.</p>
<p class="indent">While an overt focus on ethics is delayed until the final chapter of <i>Planting seeds,</i> the publication of this book is a powerfully ethical act in a number of ways. In the first place, it gives voice to the teachers who put themselves on the line by inviting Susan into their professional lives and by trying new things. These teachers embarked onto a journey into the unknown, but knowing that teaching is fundamentally ethical because one&#8217;s classroom practice inevitably marks one as <i>standing for something,</i> and that this something will change when one&#8217;s relationship with one&#8217;s students changes.</p>
<p class="indent">Critical literacy rests on the assumption that in part literacies are social constructions and that <i>all</i> texts have designs on their audience. How a reader/viewer/listener takes to a text is an index to its effect. These effects are conduits for the operation of discursive power and are often implicated in the production and perpetuation of injustice. Literacies and their associated modes of literacy instruction, instantiated in curriculum documents, official and commercial resources and classroom practices are technologies for the production of what we might call &#8220;literacy subjects&#8221;. Depending on our moral viewpoint, we are called upon to judge these technologies of literacy production by their effects. If we deem them to be oppressive, we are called upon to act. In these terms, the publication of this book, which is a kindly yet powerful invitation to New Zealand teachers to change their teaching practice, is an ethical act because it brings with it a conviction that engaging students in critical literacy is a &#8220;good&#8221;.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, regardless of the brand of critical literacy one subscribes to&#8212;and Susan&#8217;s introduction to the subject provides an excellent conceptual framework for thinking about it&#8212;the question of ethics is central. Critical literacy has a twofold purpose: 1. to enable text consumers to be savvy in their engagement; and 2. to appreciate the potential social effects of their subscribing to a particular viewpoint (or discourse). The second of these is profoundly ethical because it is effectively an invitation to consider the Other as oneself. That&#8217;s age-old wisdom and one reason why this book is such a landmark addition to the educational landscape of this country.</p>
