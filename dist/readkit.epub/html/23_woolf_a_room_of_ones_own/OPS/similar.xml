Visitation</em></a>
<p>This story was the winner of the first-place prize awarded by
<i>Amazing Stories</i> magazine in 1927, having been selected from
about 360 stories submitted for the Cover Prize Contest. The editor
praised the previously unknown author for his writing style and for
his incorporation of excellent science into the story, which tells
of a visit to the Earth from a superior people, with advanced
technology (including anti-gravity), to teach us about the
mysterious "Thon" and how it will bring about world happiness,
health, longevity, and tranquility.</p>

and Fantasy Stories From 'The Sun'</em></a>
<p>Later described as "the lost giant of American science fiction,"
Edward Page Mitchell wrote many science fiction and fantasy short
stories in the 1870's to 1890's, nearly all of which were published
anonymously in the <i>The Sun</i> daily newspaper of New York.
Mitchell was editor-in-chief of <i>The Sun</i> and was a member of
the Pulitzer Prize Board for many years.</p>
<p>Mitchell introduced many technological and social predictions
which were daring for the time, prior to similar predictions by
famous authors, such as travel by pneumatic tube, electrical
heating, newspapers printed in the home by electrical transmission,
food-pellet concentrates, international broadcasts, suspended
animation of a living human being through freezing (cryogenics), a
man rendered invisible by scientific means, a time-travel machine,
faster-than-light travel, a thinking computer, a cyborg, matter
transmission or teleportation, voting by American women, and
interracial marriage. His fantasy stories dabble with the occult
and bizarre, involving ghosts, the Devil, masochism, inanimate
objects coming to life, and more.</p>

Voyage Out</em></a>
<p>Rachel Vinrace embarks for South America on her father's ship
and is launched on a course of self-discovery in a kind of modern
mythical voyage. The mismatched jumble of passengers provide Woolf
with an opportunity to satirize Edwardian life. The novel
introduces Clarissa Dalloway, the central character of Woolf's
later novel, Mrs. Dalloway. Two of the other characters were
modeled after important figures in Woolf's life. St John Hirst is a
fictional portrayal of Lytton Strachey and Helen Ambrose is to some
extent inspired by Woolf's sister, Vanessa Bell. And Rachel's
journey from a cloistered life in a London suburb to freedom,
challenging intellectual discourse and discovery very likely
reflects Woolf's own journey from a repressive household to the
intellectual stimulation of the Bloomsbury Group.</p>

<p>Orlando: A Biography is an influential novel by Virginia Woolf,
first published on 11 October 1928. A semi-biographical novel based
in part on the life of Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West, it is
generally considered one of Woolf's most accessible novels. The
novel has been influential stylistically, and is considered
important in literature generally, and particularly in the history
of women's writing and gender studies. A film adaptation was
released in 1992, starring Tilda Swinton as Orlando and Quentin
Crisp as Queen Elizabeth I.</p>

Room</em></a>
<p>The novel centres, in a very ambiguous way, around the life
story of the protagonist Jacob Flanders, and is presented entirely
by the impressions other characters have of Jacob (except for those
times when we do indeed get Jacob's perspective). Thus, although it
could be said that the book is primarily a character study and has
little in the way of plot or background, the narrative is
constructed as a void in place of the central character, if indeed
the novel can be said to have a 'protagonist' in conventional
terms.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/3622.epub"><em>The
Kama Sutra</em></a>
<p>The Kama Sutra, is an ancient Indian text widely considered to
be the standard work on human sexual behavior in Sanskrit
literature written by the Indian scholar Vatsyayana. A portion of
the work consists of practical advice on sex. Kāma means sensual or
sexual pleasure, and sūtra are the guidlines of yoga, the word
itself means thread in Sanskrit.<br />
The Kama Sutra is the oldest and most notable of a group of texts
known generically as Kama Shastra). Traditionally, the first
transmission of Kama Shastra or "Discipline of Kama" is attributed
to Nandi the sacred bull, Shiva's doorkeeper, who was moved to
sacred utterance by overhearing the lovemaking of the god and his
wife Parvati and later recorded his utterances for the benefit of
mankind.</p>

Thing From -- "Outside"</em></a>
<p>This was one of the 6 science fiction stories published in the
first issue (April 1926) of the first magazine devoted to science
fiction, <i>Amazing Stories</i>, edited and published by Hugo
Gernsback, now considered to be the father of the science fiction
genre. He described this story:</p>
<p><i>"Here is an extraordinary story by the well-known magazine
writer, George Allan England. This story should be read quite
carefully, and it is necessary to use one's imagination in reading
it.<br />
"The theme of Mr. England's Story is unusual and extraordinary. If
we can take insects and put them upon the dissecting table in order
to study their anatomy, is there a good reason why some
super-Intelligence cannot do the same thing with us humans?<br />
"It may be taken as a certainty that Intelligence, as we understand
it, is not only of our earth. It is also not necessary to presume
that Intelligence may have its setting only in a body of flesh and
blood.<br />
"There is no reason for disbelieving that a Super-Intelligence
might not reside in gases or Invisible structures, something which
we of today cannot even imagine."</i></p>

Art of Public Speaking</em></a>
<p>Training in public speaking is not a matter of
externals--primarily; it is not a matter of
imitation--fundamentally; it is not a matter of conformity to
standards--at all. Public speaking is public utterance, public
issuance, of the man himself; therefore the first thing both in
time and in importance is that the man should be and think and feel
things that are worthy of being given forth. Unless there be
something of value within, no tricks of training can ever make of
the talker anything more than a machine--albeit a highly perfected
machine--for the delivery of other men's goods. So self-development
is fundamental in our plan.</p>

Technique of the Mystery Story</em></a>
<p>Do you love mystery stories, such as the Sherlock Holmes stories
and those of Edgar Allan Poe and Agatha Christie? Do you ever yearn
to be a good writer of mysteries?</p>
<p>Carolyn Wells was a prolific author of mystery novels. In this
detailed book, she teaches the history, types, principles, devices,
plots, and structures of mystery writings. She gives advice to
would-be authors of this genre, including ghost and riddle stories
as well as detective and crime mysteries.</p>
<p>This authoritative work begins with a justification of mystery
as a legitimate literary art form, with numerous quotations from
authorities. Then proceeding systematically through her topics, she
explains and illustrates the mystery-writing craft with excerpts
from mystery works and quotations of literary critics and notable
authors.</p>
<p>The lover of mystery will find many authors and stories cited
and excerpted in this book, which would be a good resource for
finding more material to satisfy the reader's thirst for the genre.
Aspiring authors will find insights through the critical eyes of
this successful mystery author and of the many authors whom she
quotes.</p>
<p>This is virtually a miniature course in creative writing of the

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/6666.epub"><em>The
Story of the Pony Express</em></a>
<p>An account of the most remarkable mail service ever in
existence, and its place in history.</p>
<p>The Pony Express was the first rapid transit and the first fast
mail line across the North American continent from the Missouri
River to the Pacific Coast. It was a system by means of which
messages were carried swiftly on horseback across the plains and
deserts, and over the mountains of the far West. It brought the
Atlantic coast and the rapidly developing state of California ten
days nearer to each other.</p>
<p>The Pony Express had only a brief existence, from April 1860 to
October 1861, when it was supplanted by the trans-continental
telegraph. Yet it was of the greatest importance in binding the
East and West together at a time when overland travel was slow and
cumbersome, and when a great national crisis made the rapid
communication of news between these sections an imperative
necessity.</p>
<p>The Pony Express marked the highest development in overland
travel prior to the coming of the Pacific railroad, which it
preceded by nine years. In fact, it proved the feasibility of a
transcontinental road and demonstrated that such a line could be
built and operated continuously the year around — a feat that had
always been regarded as impossible.</p>
<p>The operation of the Pony Express was a supreme achievement of
physical endurance on the part of man and his ever faithful
companion, the horse. The history of this organization should be a
lasting monument to the physical sacrifice of man and beast in an
effort to accomplish something worthwhile. Its history should be an
enduring tribute to American courage and American organizing
genius.</p>
