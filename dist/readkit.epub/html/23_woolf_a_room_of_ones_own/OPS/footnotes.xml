told that we ought to ask for £30,000 at least… It is not a large
sum, considering that there is to be but one college of this sort
for Great Britain, Ireland and the Colonies, and considering how
easy it is to raise immense sums for boys' schools. But considering
how few people really wish women to be educated, it is a good
deal.'—LADY STEPHEN, EMILY DAVIES AND GIRTON COLLEGE.] So obviously
we cannot have wine and partridges and servants carrying tin dishes
on their heads, she said. We cannot have sofas and separate rooms.
'The amenities,' she said, quoting from some book or other, 'will
have to wait.' [* Every penny which could be scraped together was
set aside for building, and the amenities had to be postponed.—R.

know that women are an overmatch for them, and therefore they
choose the weakest or the most ignorant. If they did not think so,
they never could be afraid of women knowing as much as
themselves."… In justice to the sex, I think it but candid to
acknowledge that, in a subsequent conversation, he told me that he
was serious in what he said.'—BOSWELL, THE JOURNAL OF A TOUR TO THE

<div class="footnote" id="footnote_4"><a class="marker" href=
"main3.xml#footnote_4_call">[4]</a> <span class="isfootnote">'It
remains a strange and almost inexplicable fact that in Athena's
city, where women were kept in almost Oriental suppression as
odalisques or drudges, the stage should yet have produced figures
like Clytemnestra and Cassandra Atossa and Antigone, Phedre and
Medea, and all the other heroines who dominate play after play of
the "misogynist" Euripides. But the paradox of this world where in
real life a respectable woman could hardly show her face alone in
the street, and yet on the stage woman equals or surpasses man, has
never been satisfactorily explained. In modern tragedy the same
predominance exists. At all events, a very cursory survey of
Shakespeare's work (similarly with Webster, though not with Marlowe
or Jonson) suffices to reveal how this dominance, this initiative
of women, persists from Rosalind to Lady Macbeth. So too in Racine;
six of his tragedies bear their heroines' names; and what male
characters of his shall we set against Hermione and Andromaque,
Berenice and Roxane, Phedre and Athalie? So again with Ibsen; what
men shall we match with Solveig and Nora, Heda and Hilda Wangel and
Rebecca West?'—F. L. LUCAS, TRAGEDY, pp. 114-15.</span></div>
