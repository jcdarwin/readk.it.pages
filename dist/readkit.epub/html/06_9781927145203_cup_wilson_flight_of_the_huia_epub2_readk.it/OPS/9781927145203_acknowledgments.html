         </p><div class="title-block" id="rw-title-block_74450-542621002"><h1 id="rw-h1_74450-689574147"><a href="9781927145203_tableofcontents.html">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</a></h1></div><p class="firstpara" id="rw-fp_74450-235591627">A book of this type cannot be written without help from many people. Over the years numerous individuals have influenced my ideas, and it is literally impossible to list them all. Some sent me reprints of their <span class="variable">research</span>, some presented ideas at conferences, others over drinks at cafés or pubs, but of particular importance were discussions with colleagues in the field. In preparing this book I have read the work of hundreds of naturalists, ecologists, biologists and other natural scientists. I sincerely hope that those workers whose research I have cited will consider justice was done to their labours. It was impossible to tell all the fascinating stories I wanted to include in this book, and it was with regret that so much of the good work I read about could not be covered. I sincerely acknowledge the work and contributions of all those people.
         </p><p id="rw-p_74450-467032199">I am grateful to my friends and colleagues in the Ecology and <span class="variable">Entomology</span> Group at Lincoln University. All members of the academic and support staff have assisted me in some way or another. They have all been willing to discuss ideas, read sections of manuscript, lend me books or journals, ferret out references or help in numerous other ways, but Adrian Paterson and Graham Hickling deserve special mention, for I sought advice from them so often. Thanks also to Eric Scott and Bruce Chapman, who were heads of department during the time this book was written. They gave me time to work on this project and provided departmental support. Eric’s set of the New Zealand Journal of Zoology saved me many a trip to the library. Most chapter drafts have been <span class="variable">available</span> to Lincoln University ecology students, and I appreciate the useful feedback I received from them. Certain students, some anonymously, drew my attention to references I had overlooked.
         </p><p id="rw-p_74450-539733720">In order to write such a book as this, one needs access to a vast library or the support of exceptionally helpful library staff. Lincoln University has the latter. I thank various members of the university’s library staff for processing hundreds of interloans, for locating some obscure and ancient references, for their interest and encouragement throughout this project and for forgiving the occasional misdemeanour when borrowed material was returned late.</p><p id="rw-p_74450-618884278">Chapter drafts were reviewed by Warren Chinn, Dr Richard Duncan, Dr Janet Greive, Dr Graham Hickling, Euan Kennedy, Dr Kim King, Dr Mike Imber, Dr Elaine Murphy, Dr Colin O’Donnell, Dr Shaun Ogilvie, <a id="pagebreak-rw_x"/>Dr Adrian Paterson, Dr Ralph Powlesland, Dr Murray Williams, Tony Whitaker and Trevor Worthy. I appreciate the time these busy people devoted to reviews of the manuscript and thank them for their helpful comments. Euan Kennedy, Adrian Paterson and Trevor Worthy each <span class="variable">reviewed</span> two or more complete chapters. I think Euan deserves my thanks for goading me into writing certain sections of Chapter 10.
         </p><p id="rw-p_74450-744033964">Parts of this book were written during periods of study leave. I thank Lincoln University for granting me leave and the following institutions and people for hosting me: Edward Grey Institute for Field Ornithology; Oxford University (Professor Christopher Perrins and Dr Andrew <span class="variable">Gosler</span>); School of Environmental and Information Sciences, Charles Sturt University, Albury, Australia (Professor Nicholas Klomp); and The Key Centre for Tropical Wildlife Management, Northern Territory University, Darwin, Australia (Dr Peter Whitehead, Don Franklin and Dr Richard Noske). This book could not have been written had I not enjoyed the uninterrupted time that today’s academics enjoy only during precious periods of study leave.
         </p><p id="rw-p_74450-642807028">Special thanks go to Pauline Morse for the four beautiful habitat paintings that appear in this book. I was unable to offer the financial rewards her time and skill deserved. Thanks also to Craig McNeill of the Small Design Company for the text illustrations.</p><p id="rw-p_74450-797961423">Permission to reproduce figures and quotations was kindly given by the respective authors (acknowledged in the text) and the following publishers and organisations: Department of Conservation, Elsevier Science, Ornithological Society of the New Zealand, Royal Society of New Zealand, John McIndoe, Ministry for the Environment and A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed, and the editors of <i>Condor, Herpetologica</i> and the <i>New Zealand Journal of Ecology</i>.
         </p><p id="rw-p_74450-536219523">Finally, I thank Mike Bradstock, Richard King and Kaye Godfrey at Canterbury University Press. Mike was managing editor during most of the years this book was in preparation, and his encouragement, advice, editorial skills and friendship are greatly valued. Richard ably took the reins when Mike departed and gave me invaluable advice and firm but friendly editorial direction as <i>Flight of the Huia</i> neared completion.
