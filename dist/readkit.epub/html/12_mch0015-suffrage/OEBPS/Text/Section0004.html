  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Kate Sheppard</h2>

  <p class="caption">Kate Sheppard. (<a rel="external" href="http://natlib.govt.nz/records/22651169?">1/2-C-09028; F</a>. Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand)</p>

  <p>Kate Sheppard was the leading light of the New Zealand women’s suffrage movement. In recent years her contribution to New Zealand’s identity has been acknowledged on the $10 note and a commemorative stamp.</p>

  <p>Born in Liverpool in 1847, Kate Malcolm migrated to Christchurch in her early 20s and in 1871 married merchant Walter Sheppard. In 1885 she joined the new Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), which advocated women’s suffrage as a means to fight for liquor prohibition. For Kate, suffrage quickly became an end in itself. Speaking for a new generation, she argued, ‘We are tired of having a “sphere” doled out to us, and of being told that anything outside that sphere is “unwomanly”.’</p>

  <p>Sheppard travelled the country, wrote to newspapers, held public meetings and lobbied members of Parliament. Opposition was fierce. As Wellington resident Henry Wright wrote, women were ‘recommended to go home, look after their children, cook their husbands’ dinners, empty the slops, and generally attend to the domestic affairs for which Nature designed them’; they should give up ‘meddling in masculine concerns of which they are profoundly ignorant’.</p>

  <p>In 1893 Kate Sheppard and her fellow suffragists gathered the signatures of nearly 32,000 women to demonstrate the groundswell of support for their cause. A 270-metre-long petition – then the largest ever presented to Parliament – was unrolled across the chamber of the House with dramatic effect. Despite the opposition of Premier Richard Seddon, the Electoral Act 1893 was passed by both houses of Parliament and became law on 19 September. The news took New Zealand by storm and inspired suffrage movements all over the world.</p>

  <p>Kate Sheppard continued to work at home and abroad for women’s rights – from contraception to freedom from the corset. She became president of the National Council of Women of New Zealand (NCW) and editor of <i>The White Ribbon</i>, the first newspaper in New Zealand to be owned, managed and published solely by women. In 1909 she was elected honorary vice-president of the International Council of Women.</p>

  <p>Sheppard outlived two husbands, her only son, and her only grandchild. She died on 13 July 1934, a year after the first woman MP, Labour’s Elizabeth McCombs, entered Parliament.</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Anna Stout</h2>

  <div class="media"><img alt="Anna Stout" src="../Images/anna-stout.jpg" /></div>

  <p class="caption">Anna Stout. (&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="http://natlib.govt.nz/records/23198785?">1/2-002687; F</a>. Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand.)</p>

  <p>Anna Stout (née Logan) was strongly influenced by her parents who were committed to the prohibition movement and heavily involved in other social reforms. She shared these values with her husband Robert Stout, a barrister and member of Parliament, whom she married in 1876. He became attorney general in 1878 and was premier from 1884 to 1887. Anna commuted between Dunedin and Wellington while raising six children.</p>

  <p>She became involved in voluntary work and in 1885 became a foundation member of the WCTU. Anna and Robert were dedicated to the advancement of women, championing calls for equal political, legal, social and educational rights. Anna was particularly concerned for the education of Māori women. A public clash with her husband over her support for greater rights for Chinese immigrants showed that she had a strong will of her own.</p>

  <p>In April 1892 Anna Stout was elected president of the Women’s Franchise League in Dunedin, one of the leading local suffrage organisations. When the NCW was established in 1896, she became a vice-president. Her links to the main body of politically active women in the country were weakened as a result of a public falling-out with the NCW in 1897. This did not end her involvement in wider issues affecting women here and overseas. While in England between 1909 and 1912 she became involved in the British suffrage movement, establishing close ties with the Pankhursts and other feminist leaders.</p>

  <p>Anna Stout’s opposition to the ‘double standard of morality’ was highlighted during a trial in Wellington in 1918. She observed how unfair it was that five women were charged with running a brothel while their clients went free. In 1922, at the height of a wave of public concern over the incidence of venereal disease, she opposed the reintroduction of compulsory medical examination of women suspected of prostitution, publishing a pamphlet criticising the medical authorities.</p>

  <p>During the 1920s Anna Stout suffered from poor health and became less active in public affairs. She died on 10 May 1931 at Hanmer Springs, aged 72.</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Ada Wells</h2>

  <div class="media"><img alt="Ada Wells" src="../Images/ada-wells.jpg" /></div>

  <p class="caption">Ada Wells in 1910. (<a rel="external" href="http://natlib.govt.nz/records/22728937?">1/2-C-016534-F</a>. Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand.)</p>

  <p>Ada Wells worked tirelessly to achieve equality and economic independence for women. She is best remembered for her contribution to the women’s suffrage campaign in the 1880s and 1890s, and for becoming the first woman elected to the Christchurch City Council in 1917.</p>

  <p>Ada Wells (née Pike) was born in England in April 1863 and came to New Zealand with her parents at the age of 10. She was educated at Avonside School from 1874 and Christchurch West School from 1876. Between 1877 and 1881 she was employed at the latter school as a student teacher. In 1881 she won a university junior scholarship and attended Canterbury College, passing the first part of her BA in 1882. She was then briefly employed as an assistant teacher at Christchurch Girls’ High School.</p>

  <p>In January 1884 she married Harry Wells, an organist, with whom she would have four children. Her husband’s volatile temper and continual drinking often saw her forced to financially support the family by taking on teaching positions and private patients for massage and healing. This marital experience has been credited with strengthening her views on the importance of equality and economic independence for women.</p>

  <p>Wells became active in the women’s suffrage campaign in the 1880s, a period during which the movement was generally condemned and ridiculed. While Kate Sheppard led the campaign, Wells made an invaluable contribution as a fervent, efficient organiser and campaigner. In 1892 she was involved in the foundation of the Canterbury Women’s Institute (CWI). The CWI spearheaded the suffrage campaign in Canterbury, in a similar manner to the Women’s Franchise Leagues formed in other parts of the country.</p>

  <p>After women were granted the vote on 19 September 1893, Wells did not retire from public life. The CWI had always been ‘forward looking’, advocating a broader platform of women’s rights beyond suffrage. Wells continued to serve the organisation as president, secretary or committee member until its demise in 1921. She was also involved in the foundation of the NCW on 13 April 1896, and was appointed as its first secretary.</p>

  <p>In 1899 she won public office, becoming one of the first two women to be elected to the Ashburton and North Canterbury United Charitable Aid Board. She bettered this in 1917 when she was the first woman elected to the Christchurch City Council. By the time of her death in March 1933, Wells was acknowledged as one of New Zealand’s foremost public women.</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Meri Te Tai Mangakāhia</h2>

  <div class="media"><img alt="Meri Te Tai Mangakāhia" src="../Images/meri-te-tai-mangakahia.jpg" /></div>

  <p class="caption">Meri Te Tai Mangakāhia. (C5101, Davis Collection <a rel="external" href="http://http://www.aucklandmuseum.com/">Auckland War Memorial Museum.</a> )</p>

  <p>Meri Te Tai Mangakāhia, of Te Rarawa, was born in the Hokianga district. Her husband, Hāmiora Mangakāhia of Hauraki, was elected premier of the Māori Kotahitanga parliament in 1892. At a meeting of the parliament in Hawke’s Bay in 1893, Meri Te Tai presented a motion requesting that women participate in the selection of members. She later addressed the parliament on her motion – the first woman known to have done so.</p>

  <p>During her speech she urged that women should not only be allowed to vote, but also to sit in the Māori parliament as members. Many Māori women owned land in their own right and were entitled to have their say in decisions affecting them. The matter lapsed, but Meri Te Tai remained involved in Māori politics and welfare, and probably took part in the women’s committees of the Kotahitanga (Māori unity) movement, forerunners of the Māori Women’s Welfare League. Meri Te Tai died of influenza in 1920, aged 52.</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Harriet Russell Morison</h2>

  <div class="media"><img alt="Harriet Morison cartoon" src="../Images/harriet-morison.jpg" /></div>

  <p class="caption">Harriet Morison depicted as a knight on a charger lancing the 'sweating' monster. (<a rel="external" href="http://natlib.govt.nz/records/23154731?">H-713-106</a>. Cartoon by William Blomfield. Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand.)</p>

  <p>Dynamic and determined, Harriet Morison helped establish trade unions for female workers and was one of the leaders in the campaign to get votes for women. Born in Ireland in 1862, she came to New Zealand with her family in 1874 and was employed as a tailoress. She became vice-president of the Tailoresses’ Union of New Zealand in 1889, and in 1890 took over as its secretary. She tirelessly pressed for higher wages and better conditions for tailoresses, and also lobbied for representation of other groups of women workers, such as domestic servants.</p>

  <p>Believing that equality was fundamental to the Christian message, Morison was involved in the WCTU and helped found the Dunedin Women’s Franchise League. Both organisations campaigned for voting rights for women, and Morison helped convert many working women to the cause, gathering signatures for the suffrage petitions that circulated nationwide in the early 1890s.</p>

  <p>In 1896 Morison left the Tailoresses’ Union under a cloud, accused of embezzling funds – she had naively deposited fundraising money in an account under her own name. However in 1906 she was appointed inspector of factories for the South Island, and in 1908 took charge of a Department of Labour Women’s Branch (essentially a labour bureau for female domestic servants) in Auckland. Her public service career was stormy, possibly because of her tendency to be forthright. She was forced to resign in 1921 when the Women’s Branches were disestablished.</p>

  <p>Harriet Morison died in Auckland in 1925, after a life of successful activism on behalf of all women, but especially working women.</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Henry Smith Fish</h2>

  <div class="media"><img alt="Henry Smith Fish" src="../Images/henry-fish.jpg" /></div>

  <p class="caption">Henry Smith Fish. (<a rel="external" href="http://natlib.govt.nz/records/23029548?">35mm-00127-a-F</a>. Photographer William Henshaw Clarke, Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand.)</p>

  <p>An able but controversial politician, Henry Smith Fish is best remembered for his aggressive attempts to prevent women getting the vote.</p>

  <p>He was born in London in 1838 and travelled with his family to Melbourne as a child. In 1863 he came to Dunedin, where he worked for the family painting and glazing business, and in 1867 became a city councillor. He soon gained a reputation for being conceited, rude and untrustworthy, but was also a skilled tactician with a talent for electioneering. As well as serving for more than 20 years on the city council, six as mayor, Fish was elected to the Otago Provincial Council in 1870 and again in 1873, and was a member of the Otago Harbour Board for six years.</p>

  <p>In politics Fish switched allegiances often, and rumours of dubious morality and petty corruption dogged him. Nevertheless, he had a faithful following among the working men of South Dunedin. He was elected to Parliament in 1881 and, after being voted out in 1884, returned in 1887. Fish soon fell out with the Liberals and became notorious for insulting behaviour. He resisted extending the vote to women and organised two petitions against this, but his credibility was tarnished when it was discovered that he had paid people to sign them.</p>

  <p>In 1892 women ratepayers helped tip the balance against him in the Dunedin mayoral race, and his failure to be re-elected to Parliament in 1893 was also attributed to female voting power. He won back his seat in 1896, but died the following year.</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">John Hall</h2>

  <div class="media"><img alt="John hall" src="../Images/john-halljpg.jpg" /></div>

  <p class="caption">John Hall. (<a rel="external" href="http://natlib.govt.nz/records/22737166?">PAColl-3768-4-02</a>. Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand.)</p>

  <p>John Hall was one of a number of prominent late-19th-century male politicians who supported the cause of women’s suffrage; others included John Ballance, George Grey, William Fox, Robert Stout and Julius Vogel.</p>

  <p>Born in Hull, England, Hall came to Canterbury in 1852 and soon entered provincial and national politics. With the exception of trips back to Britain and some periods of ill health, he was usually in cabinet. After George Grey's ministry fell in October 1879, he forged a government in alliance with Auckland politicians. His legacy was mixed. He passed Grey’s Triennial Parliaments Bill and enfranchised all adult men, but was financially conservative. One of his ministers led the raid on the Māori village of Parihaka. Hall’s government held onto power after the 1881 election, but he was ill and soon resigned to recuperate in England.</p>

  <p>After returning to New Zealand in 1887, Sir John (he was knighted in 1882) worked closely with Kate Sheppard for female suffrage and, as an opposition member, led the parliamentary fight to have the legislation passed. It was Hall who presented the massive 1893 petition to the House of Representatives on 11 August. Glued together to form a continuous sheet, the 270-metre-long petition was rolled around a broomstick and brought into the House in a wheelbarrow. Hall theatrically unrolled it down the aisle of the chamber until it thumped against the far wall.</p>

  <p>Sir John retired from politics in 1893, the year his suffrage aims were achieved. He was honoured by his province by being elected mayor of Christchurch in 1906 to preside over its international exhibition.</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Elizabeth Reid McCombs</h2>

  <div class="media"><img alt="Elizabeth McCombs" src="../Images/elizabeth-mccombs.jpg" /></div>

  <p class="caption">Elizabeth McCombs. (<a rel="external" href="http://natlib.govt.nz/records/23136870?">1/2-150372-F</a>. Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand.)</p>

  <p>Forty years after women in New Zealand received the right to vote in 1893, Elizabeth McCombs became the first female member of Parliament when she won a by-election in the Lyttelton seat for the Labour Party on 13 September 1933.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Reid Henderson was part of a family of prominent, educated women. Although she was too young to sign the 1893 women’s suffrage petition, three of her sisters did so. Alice became a Presbyterian missionary, while both Christina and Stella gained university degrees and were later active in the NCW. Christina taught at Christchurch Girls’ High School and Stella became a journalist.</p>

  <p>According to one of her elder sisters, Elizabeth was ‘lazy at school and we did not expect great things from her’. She became politically active, however, in organisations dedicated to the removal of women’s civil and political disabilities, and was a prominent figure in the WCTU.</p>

  <p>In June 1903 Elizabeth married James McCombs. They had two children, Terence and Alison, and also raised two orphans. James was elected to Parliament as a representative of the Social Democratic Party in 1913. He became the first president of the second New Zealand Labour Party in 1916, when Elizabeth was also elected onto the party executive.</p>

  <p>In 1921 Elizabeth McCombs began a long association with local politics when she was elected to the Christchurch City Council. She convinced the council to build a crèche and women’s rest room in Cathedral Square, and in 1925, as a member of the electricity committee, fought for the lowest domestic electricity rates in the country. During the early years of the 1930s economic depression, she worked hard for the unemployed as a member of the hospital board’s benevolent committee and the committee administering the Mayor’s Relief of Distress Fund.</p>

  <p>Women had gained the right to stand for Parliament in 1919. Elizabeth McCombs stood unsuccessfully in 1928 and 1931, campaigning in the latter year under the slogan ‘Vote the first Woman to the New Zealand Parliament’. The opportunity presented itself again in August 1933 when her husband died, forcing a by-election in the Lyttelton seat. Some Labour leaders were not convinced about her candidacy as James had only won by a narrow margin in 1931. They had no cause for concern – Elizabeth was elected with an overwhelming majority.</p>

  <p>In her time in Parliament Elizabeth McCombs tried to keep women’s issues at the forefront, advocating causes such as equal pay. But she had little opportunity to effect change. Labour was then in opposition and she died less than two years later, in June 1935.</p>

  <p>After her death her son Terence won the Lyttelton seat, which he was to hold for the next 16 years.</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Iriaka Matiu Rātana</h2>

  <div class="media"><img alt="Iriaka Matiu Rātana" src="../Images/iriaka-ratana.jpg" /></div>

  <p class="caption">Iriaka Rātana speaking at Manukorihi marae, Waitara, in 1966. (AAMK W3495 21 21B. <a rel="external" href="http://www.archives.govt.nz">Archives New Zealand</a>.)</p>

  <p>The first Māori woman to be elected to Parliament, Iriaka Matiu Rātana was a passionate advocate for the welfare of her people.</p>

  <p>She was born Iriaka Te Rio at Hiruhārama (Jerusalem) on the Whanganui River in 1905, and had connections to Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi through both parents. A talented singer, at 16 she went to live at Rātana pā, joining and later training the young people’s cultural groups that accompanied prophet Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana on his tours around the country. In 1925 she became Rātana’s second wife and after his death, in 1939, she married Matiu, his son by his first marriage. By then, she was one of the most influential women in the Rātana movement.</p>

  <p>Matiu Rātana won the Western Maori seat in 1945 but died in 1949, and Iriaka decided to step into his place. Despite vehement opposition from some, she became the Labour Party candidate and was comfortably elected. After giving birth to her seventh child in December 1949, she entered Parliament.</p>

  <p>Iriaka Rātana accepted the desirability of Māori integration into Pākehā society, and was optimistic about the future of race relations. These attitudes assured her of a respectful hearing in Parliament. Distressed by the poverty and powerlessness of many Māori, she looked to the Department of Māori Affairs and organisations such as the Māori Women’s Welfare League (to which she belonged) for answers. She worked ceaselessly to represent the interests of her constituents, and in the 1950s successfully fought for the upgrading of services at Rātana pā. In 1969 Iriaka Rātana retired from politics. She died in 1981, survived by nine children and many grandchildren.</p>
