  <h1>The suffrage petitions</h1>

  <p>Gathering signatures on a petition to present to Parliament is a traditional form of action for groups seeking to correct a grievance or persuade those in authority to change the law. Petitions were especially important for New Zealand’s 19th-century suffrage campaigners, as women were excluded from the electoral process and (unlike the British ‘suffragettes’ of later decades) they rejected more radical forms of protest action.</p>

  <p>Suffrage supporters petitioned Parliament on several occasions in the 1880s. Led by the Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), Women’s Franchise Leagues and other organisations, their efforts gathered momentum in the early 1890s. Signatures were collected around the country at public meetings or by door-to-door canvassing, and the petitions were presented to Parliament by sympathetic male politicians such as Sir John Hall. These petitions were only signed by women who were British subjects and over 21 years old – the aim was to show that the signatories were qualified to vote in all respects other than their gender.</p>

  <p>In 1891 eight petitions containing more than 9000 signatures were gathered, and in 1892 six petitions containing almost 20,000 were presented. In both years the House of Representatives passed electoral bills that would have enfranchised all adult women. Both times opponents sabotaged the legislation in the Legislative Council, the more conservative upper house, by adding amendments.</p>

  <p>In 1893 suffrage campaigners redoubled their efforts, and on 28 July the WCTU submitted a massive petition signed by ‘Mary J. Carpenter and 25,519 others’. The signatures were gathered locally on more than 500 individual sheets, which were glued together to form a single roll stretching more than 270 metres. The petition was rolled around a broomstick and brought into the House of Representatives in a wheelbarrow. John Hall then theatrically unrolled it down the aisle of the chamber until it thumped against the far wall. At the time it was reportedly the largest petition ever presented to an Australasian parliament.</p>

  <p>A dozen other smaller suffrage petitions – some gathered in specific towns and regions – were also submitted around the same time. When John Hall presented them to the House of Representatives on 11 August he noted that taken together they contained the signatures of 31,872 women − almost a quarter of the entire adult European female population of New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Few Māori women signed the 1893 suffrage petition, and the male Māori members of the House of Representatives were not particularly sympathetic to the cause. However, when the question of Māori women voting alongside their Pākehā sisters was raised during 1893 debates over the suffrage legislation, it was overwhelmingly endorsed by the House.</p>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Thirteen petitions</h2>

  <p>The Carpenter petition was by far the largest of 13 separate petitions collected by women’s suffrage supporters in 1893:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Mary J. Carpenter and 25,519 others</li>

    <li>Kate Baldwin and 2765 others</li>

    <li>[Mrs] Gerald L. Peacock, of Devonport, Auckland: 2301 names</li>

    <li>Elizabeth M. Eyre Kenny and 601 others (probably collected in Nelson)</li>

    <li>Caroline Anderson and 393 others</li>

    <li>Mrs J. Irwin Wilson, of Whāngārei: 83 names</li>

    <li>Marian Kirker and 49 others</li>

    <li>Clara M. Birch and 40 others</li>

    <li>Sophia James and 34 others</li>

    <li>Lizzie F. Rattray, of Auckland: 31 names</li>

    <li>Harriet Win: 23 names</li>

    <li>F. Nightingale, of Nelson: 16 names</li>

    <li>Sarah Lurchin and 15 others.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Little is known about the 12 smaller petitions, which do not appear to have survived. It is likely that they were compiled in specific regions, which would help explain some notable gaps in the geographical coverage of the Carpenter petition.</p>
