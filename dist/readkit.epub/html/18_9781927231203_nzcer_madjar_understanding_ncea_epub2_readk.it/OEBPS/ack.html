<h1>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The Starpath Project for Tertiary Participation and Success was established in 2005. Its aim is to investigate ways of transforming current patterns of educational underachievement in New Zealand secondary schools, particularly for M&#257;ori and Pacific students, and students from low- to mid-decile schools. One of the barriers to student success we identified was that many parents, students and even teachers have a poor understanding of NCEA (the National Certificates of Educational Achievement).</p>
<p class="noindent">This book was born out of our realisation that, when it comes to NCEA, parents, students and schools are often talking past each other. Our research indicates that parents are still struggling to understand how NCEA can work for their child. Students are often left to manage their own NCEA pathways. Some do it very well indeed, but too many students work out where the short cuts might be (such as how to get the most credits for the least effort), without appreciating the longer term consequences of their decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Hence this book! In it we have drawn on our research and written specifically for students and parents&#8212;not for academics or researchers (unless they are also parents still trying to work out the ins and outs of NCEA). All the stories in the book are based on our research, but in each case we have combined a number of stories, changed names and other identifying details, and added a few elements to make the material easier to understand.</p>
<p class="noindent">This book would not have been possible without the heartfelt stories told to us by many students and parents who took part in our research. We thank them for giving us the material from which to write, and the reason for writing. If other students and their parents, new to NCEA, find this book useful we will have achieved our goal.</p>
<p class="noindent">This second edition of the book was made necessary by a number of changes to the NCEA regulations over the past 2 years, including those related to numeracy and literacy and the University Entrance requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent">We are grateful to the Starpath partner schools who continue to teach us about the realities and challenges of educating our young people. Thank you to the Starpath research team, and in particular Seini Jensen, who undertook many of the parent and student interviews and ensured we heard the stories we needed to hear.</p>
<p class="noindent">We also acknowledge all those who have provided suggestions and feedback on the initial drafts of this book&#8212;in particular, Dr Samantha Smith for her intellectual input and clarifying comments; Mr Michael Withiel for his thorough and insightful critique; Shona Ramsay, Senior Policy Analysis at NZQA; and the many anonymous students and parents for their comments and suggestions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The curriculum flow charts in Appendix 1 are reproduced with the permission of Kaitaia College, and we thank the school for allowing us to use this material.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, we thank David Ellis, publishing manager at NZCER Press, for championing the book and helping us, expertly and patiently, through the sometimes intricate publication process, and James Watson for his quirky but brilliant illustrations.</p>
