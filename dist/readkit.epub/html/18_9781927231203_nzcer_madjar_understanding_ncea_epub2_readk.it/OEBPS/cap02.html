<h3><a id="p07"/>KEY POINTS</h3>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Whatever your plans are for when you leave school, make sure you understand how NCEA works and how it affects your options and choices.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Plan early where you want to go so that you can select the best possible pathway through NCEA that will get you there. Just hoping to become a teacher, lawyer, film maker or chef is not enough. To be able to get to a career of your choice it is important that you, and your parents/wh&#257;nau, learn what you need to achieve at school, and how you can best achieve the required credits in the most appropriate subjects.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; As well as understanding NCEA, make sure you also understand the school &#8220;rules&#8221; that go with it. What prerequisites do you need to have, how many credits do you need to achieve, and how well do you need to do to be able to progress to the next level of a subject?</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Be aware of timetabling issues. If chemistry and tourism are timetabled in the same period, decide carefully which is more important and which you will need as a prerequisite for the following year.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; If you are not clear about your career plans, keep your options open. This usually means taking English, maths and science in Years 11 and 12, and adding one or more academic subjects.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Whatever your aspirations or plans, do your best to achieve as much as you can while you are at school.</p>
<p class="subheading-2"><b>If your plans include university study</b></p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Choose your NCEA subjects carefully, and try to achieve a good balance between science subjects (including maths) and subjects such as English, history, drama, social studies, media studies and classics, which will help develop your analytical and critical thinking skills as well as your writing and presentation skills.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Aim for a good balance between essential academic studies and extracurricular activities, including sports and leadership roles. You need to develop as a rounded person, but don&#8217;t allow extracurricular activities to limit your academic achievement.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Talk with your teachers, career guidance counsellors, parents and other adults who can help you make the best possible decisions at each step through NCEA. It is really disappointing when students reach Year 13 and only then realise that they should have taken a different subject, or achieved 10 more credits in Year 11.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Aim to achieve NCEA Level 1 in Year 11 and NCEA Level 2 in Year 12, and aim to achieve more than 60 Level 2 credits in Year 12.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Aim to achieve both NCEA Level 3 and UE with best possible grades, and more than the minimum number of credits at this level. Universities have started using ranking procedures to select students, not only for the limited-entry degrees such as medicine or engineering, but for admission to all university degree programmes. This is also important for students planning to complete a conjoint degree (i.e., to study for two degrees at the same time, such as business and law, or economics and political science). Aim to achieve at least 18 credits in each of the subjects. How many credits you achieve, and how many of these are with Merit or Excellence, could make the difference between acceptance in or rejection from a course and/or university of your choice.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Consider taking the Scholarship award exams at the end of Year 13, and discuss with your teachers how you can best prepare for them.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Check the entry requirements for the degree programme and university you plan to attend, and make sure you meet these criteria. If these include a subject your school is not offering (e.g., Level 3 physics or calculus), discuss with your school (and your parents) how you can best access that subject. Distance education, with some local support, might be one option, but it will require good time management and determination on your part.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Review your plans, achievements, subject choices and study practices regularly to make sure you remain on track and are achieving the required targets along the way. It is especially helpful if your school is using a system of academic counselling or coaching so that you have a teacher who is aware of your plans and can help you with review and advice.</p>
