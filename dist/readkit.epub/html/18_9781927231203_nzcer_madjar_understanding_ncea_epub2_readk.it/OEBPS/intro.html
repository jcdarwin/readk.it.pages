<h1><br/>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Once upon a time students turned up at school and teachers decided what they needed to learn, how they should be taught, and what grades or qualifications they had earned. Today things are very different, especially when it comes to senior high school years and the National Certificates of Educational Achievement (NCEA). NCEA is the national school leaving qualification, used by the majority of secondary schools in New Zealand. It allows students to choose from a large number of subjects, to decide how much content they wish to learn and, to a certain extent, to decide how they wish to be assessed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the pre-2002 system, students who failed to achieve School Certificate or a higher qualification came away with a failed record. Achievement depended entirely on the end-of-year exam results for each subject, and national results were adjusted so that only half of the students passed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The NCEA system, introduced in 2002 and used during the final 3 years of secondary schooling, is different in several ways.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Students&#8217; learning is assessed both during and at the end of the school year.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Assessment is &#8220;standards based&#8221;. In other words, if a student achieves a set standard for a particular section of a subject or course, he or she is awarded a pass, regardless of how any other students performed.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; Students&#8217; Records of Achievement document what the students have learned and what skills they have mastered, for all the courses they have undertaken.</p>
<p class="noindent">NCEA is offered at three levels: Level 1 (usually in Year 11), Level 2 (usually in Year 12) and Level 3 (usually in Year 13). A particular combination of subjects, mostly at Level 3, makes up the University Entrance (UE) qualification.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the surface, then, NCEA can seem simple and straight forward. So, why do we think that students and their families might find this book useful when dealing with NCEA for the first time, such as at the end of Year 10, when students are choosing subjects for NCEA Level 1 in Year 11? And why might it also be helpful to students further along the NCEA path?</p>
<p class="subheading"><a id="p01"/><b>YOU NEED A BOOK TO UNDERSTAND NCEA?!</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The main reason we wrote this book was because NCEA is both complex and flexible, and that can make it difficult to understand for people who are new to it. Our aim is to make NCEA understandable, so that students and their families can make NCEA work for them and help them reach their goals. This is especially important for students aiming to go on to tertiary education, including university.</p>
<p class="subheading-2"><b>NCEA is complex</b></p>
<p class="noindent">NCEA is complex because it is designed to meet the needs of students with a broad range of abilities and interests. It can accommodate students who need to prepare for university studies in medicine or engineering, those who plan to undertake apprenticeships in building or hairdressing, as well as those who want to learn mostly practical skills and join the workforce directly from school. This means that a large high school might offer 40 or more subjects, from accounting to woodwork. Because each student is able to take only five or six subjects each year, how do you decide which subjects to take?</p>
<p class="noindent">To make things more difficult, many subjects have prerequisites. This means that to be allowed to do music, or French, at Level 3 (Year 13), for example, a student needs to have done these subjects at Levels 1 (Year 11) and 2 (Year 12). Sometimes schools will allow a student to go on without a specified prerequisite, but in most cases the expectation is that the prerequisites listed in the school curriculum guide will be met. How does a student at the end of Year 10 know what he or she will want to study 3 years later?</p>
<p class="subheading-2"><b>NCEA is flexible</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Because it is designed to meet the needs of students with different interests and abilities, NCEA is flexible. This means that:</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; schools can select which standards (components) to include in a subject and can adjust subject content to suit the learning needs of their students</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; students can study catering along with physics, and many other combinations of subjects</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; students can study at different Levels of NCEA at the same time, even within the same subjects or courses</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226; students can complete non-NCEA subjects and have them credited towards NCEA, and they can use NCEA credits towards other (non-NCEA) qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent">This flexibility also means that schools can offer different versions of core subjects such as English, maths and science&#8212;some designed for &#8220;academically able&#8221; students going on to university, and others for students thought to need a more &#8220;practical&#8221; or &#8220;applied&#8221; knowledge of these subjects.</p>
<p class="subheading"><b>HOW THIS BOOK CAN HELP YOU</b></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="p02"/>NCEA&#8217;s complexity and flexibility can be a trap for students without clear goals, good advice, and careful planning. We hope this book will help you become more informed about how NCEA works, and how you can make it work for you. The first chapter outlines how NCEA works. It is intended primarily for students, but it is important that parents read it too.</p>
<p class="noindent">The final chapter is written specially for parents/wh&#257;nau and explains why it is important that, as parents, you talk with your children (and their teachers) about their subject choices, how well they are doing at school, and what they hope to do when they leave school. To help your children you need to understand what they are doing, when you can stand back, and when it might be a good idea to step in and talk with them or their school.</p>
<p class="noindent">Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5 are based on stories of students making different kinds of subject choices, some helpful, some not. Based on real-life experiences of over 120 students we have talked with in the course of our research, these stories show how students can plan their pathways through the three NCEA years and what can happen when they make good (or not so good) choices. Individual names are made up, and the stories are based on a whole collection of different stories and do not describe specific individuals.</p>
