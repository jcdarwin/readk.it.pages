Canterville Ghost</em></a>
<p>The Canterville Ghost is a popular 1887 novella by Oscar Wilde,
widely adapted for the screen and stage.<br />
“The Canterville Ghost” is a parody featuring a dramatic spirit
named Sir Simon and the United States minister (ambassador) to the
Court of St. James's, Hiram B. Otis. Mr. Otis travels to England
with his family and moves into a haunted country house. Lord
Canterville, the previous owner of the house, warns Mr. Otis that
the ghost of Sir Simon de Canterville has haunted it ever since he
killed his wife, Eleonore, three centuries before. But Mr. Otis
dismisses the ghost story as bunk and disregards Lord Canterville’s
warnings. When the Otises learn that the house is indeed haunted,
they succeed in victimizing the ghost and in disregarding age-old
British traditions. What emerges is a satire of American
materialism, a lampoon of traditional British values, and an
amusing twist on the traditional gothic horror tale.</p>

Importance of Being Earnest</em></a>
<p>Set in England during the late Victorian era, the play's humour
derives in part from characters maintaining fictitious identities
to escape unwelcome social obligations. It is replete with witty
dialogue and satirizes some of the foibles and hypocrisy of late
Victorian society. It has proved Wilde's most enduringly popular
play.</p>

Susan</em></a>
<p>Austen's "most wicked tale," Lady Susan is a short epistolary
novel by Jane Austen, possibly written in 1794 but not published
until 1871. Lady Susan is a selfish, attractive woman, who tries to
trap the best possible husband while maintaining a relationship
with a married man. She subverts all the standards of the romantic
novel; she has an active role, she's not only beautiful but
intelligent and witty, and her suitors are significantly younger
than she is.</p>

Men in a Boat</em></a>
<p>Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog), published in
1889, is a humorous account by Jerome K. Jerome of a boating
holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford.<br />
The book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with
accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous
elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat
sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel. One of
the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it
appears to modern readers, the jokes seem fresh and witty even
today.<br />
The three men are based on Jerome himself (the narrator J.) and two
real-life friends, George Wingrave (who went on to become a senior
manager in Barclays Bank) and Carl Hentschel (the founder of a
London printing business, called Harris in the book), with whom he
often took boating trips. The dog, Montmorency, is entirely
fictional, but "as Jerome admits, developed out of that area of
inner consciousness which, in all Englishmen, contains an element
of the dog." The trip is a typical boating holiday of the time in a
Thames camping skiff. This is just after commercial boat traffic on
the Upper Thames had died out, replaced by the 1880s craze for
boating as a leisure activity.</p>
