         <p id="p13">Whether by coincidence or design, Bridget Williams Books emailed their proposed selection of my articles about the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February 2013. It had been a long time since I&#8217;d read most of them; it felt more like five years than two since I wrote my first account of post-disaster Christchurch, which the <em>Listener</em> sub-editors headlined 'Hope and despair'.
         </p>

         <p id="p14">I hadn&#8217;t noticed how much my memory had blunted until, as I re-read that piece and others from those first few weeks after 22.2.11, I felt a hard jab of anxiety as the sense of <em>extremis</em> came back to me. It was the shock of learning that people we knew had died and been terribly injured; the glazed fury of activity as we rescued stuff from our badly damaged home while neighbours all around us were doing the same; the earnest satisfaction that came from making do without functioning sewerage and endless running water; the adrenalin that pulsed through the torso and limbs with every decent aftershock.
         </p>

         <p id="p15">In post-earthquake Christchurch, I was one of the very lucky ones. Not just because none of my family were killed or injured; not just because, after nine months of displacement and frustration, we managed to do patch-up repairs on our house and go back home; not just because my husband and I had jobs and savings that made the post-disaster uncertainty seem less frightening.</p>

         <p id="p16">I was one of the lucky ones because I got to tell stories. Sometimes people I met would tell me that they appreciated what I was writing in the <em>Listener</em>, and that it helped them make sense of what had happened to us all. It was always humbling to receive such supportive comments, but I always knew that, in telling stories, I was also helping myself to find order and perspective amid calamity. Journalism was the searchlight I used to find my way through crisis. And, 23 years after I started out as a reporter, the earthquake and its aftermath reminded me that no matter how the present crisis facing the news industry ends up, communities need news. In post-quake Christchurch, people were hungry for it &#8211; news that helped them find their way through the tangle of insurance-related bureaucracy, that made sense of the topsy-turvy political effects of disaster, that gave them cause for hope and reason for rage, that helped them comprehend the magnitude of physical destruction and social upheaval.

         <p id="p17">I am still trying to comprehend it. Even now, I cycle through the apocalyptic environment of the central city and feel winded by what I see. Even now, I wonder how the dismantling of entire suburbs and the forced buy-out of commercial property owners can occur without leaving a trail of grievances and hurt. But one thing I have come to comprehend a little better is the scale of the story: it has years &#8211; probably decades &#8211; to run.</p>

         <p id="p18">I would like to thank my wonderful colleagues at the <em>Listener</em> for giving me the space to tell what I can of Christchurch&#8217;s story. And thanks to Geoff Walker and Bridget Williams Books for the care that has been taken in putting this selection together.<br/>
