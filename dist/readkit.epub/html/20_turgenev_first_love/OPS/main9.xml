<p>My ‘passion’ dated from that day. I felt at that time, I
recollect, something like what a man must feel on entering the
service: I had ceased now to be simply a young boy; I was in love.
I have said that my passion dated from that day; I might have added
that my sufferings too dated from the same day. Away from Zinaïda I
pined; nothing was to my mind; everything went wrong with me; I
spent whole days thinking intensely about her&#160;… I pined when
away,… but in her presence I was no better off. I was jealous; I
was conscious of my insignificance; I was stupidly sulky or
stupidly abject, and, all the same, an invincible force drew me to
her, and I could not help a shudder of delight whenever I stepped
through the doorway of her room. Zinaïda guessed at once that I was
in love with her, and indeed I never even thought of concealing it.
She amused herself with my passion, made a fool of me, petted and
tormented me. There is a sweetness in being the sole source, the
autocratic and irresponsible cause of the greatest joy and
profoundest pain to another, and I was like wax in Zinaïda’s hands;
though, indeed, I was not the only one in love with her. All the
men who visited the house were crazy over her, and she kept them
all in leading-strings at her feet. It amused her to arouse their
hopes and then their fears, to turn them round her finger (she used
to call it knocking their heads together), while they never dreamed
of offering resistance and eagerly submitted to her. About her
whole being, so full of life and beauty, there was a peculiarly
bewitching mixture of slyness and carelessness, of artificiality
and simplicity, of composure and frolicsomeness; about everything
she did or said, about every action of hers, there clung a
delicate, fine charm, in which an individual power was manifest at
work. And her face was ever changing, working too; it expressed,
almost at the same time, irony, dreaminess, and passion. Various
emotions, delicate and quick-changing as the shadows of clouds on a
sunny day of wind, chased one another continually over her lips and
eyes.</p>
<p>Each of her adorers was necessary to her. Byelovzorov, whom she
sometimes called ‘my wild beast,’ and sometimes simply ‘mine,’
would gladly have flung himself into the fire for her sake. With
little confidence in his intellectual abilities and other
qualities, he was for ever offering her marriage, hinting that the
others were merely hanging about with no serious intention.
Meidanov responded to the poetic fibres of her nature; a man of
rather cold temperament, like almost all writers, he forced himself
to convince her, and perhaps himself, that he adored her, sang her
praises in endless verses, and read them to her with a peculiar
enthusiasm, at once affected and sincere. She sympathised with him,
and at the same time jeered at him a little; she had no great faith
in him, and after listening to his outpourings, she would make him
read Pushkin, as she said, to clear the air. Lushin, the ironical
doctor, so cynical in words, knew her better than any of them, and
loved her more than all, though he abused her to her face and
behind her back. She could not help respecting him, but made him
smart for it, and at times, with a peculiar, malignant pleasure,
made him feel that he too was at her mercy. ‘I’m a flirt, I’m
heartless, I’m an actress in my instincts,’ she said to him one day
in my presence; ‘well and good! Give me your hand then; I’ll stick
this pin in it, you’ll be ashamed of this young man’s seeing it, it
will hurt you, but you’ll laugh for all that, you truthful person.’
Lushin crimsoned, turned away, bit his lips, but ended by
submitting his hand. She pricked it, and he did in fact begin to
laugh,… and she laughed, thrusting the pin in pretty deeply, and
peeping into his eyes, which he vainly strove to keep in other
directions… .</p>
<p>I understood least of all the relations existing between Zinaïda
and Count Malevsky. He was handsome, clever, and adroit, but
something equivocal, something false in him was apparent even to
me, a boy of sixteen, and I marvelled that Zinaïda did not notice
it. But possibly she did notice this element of falsity really and
was not repelled by it. Her irregular education, strange
acquaintances and habits, the constant presence of her mother, the
poverty and disorder in their house, everything, from the very
liberty the young girl enjoyed, with the consciousness of her
superiority to the people around her, had developed in her a sort
of half-contemptuous carelessness and lack of fastidiousness. At
any time anything might happen; Vonifaty might announce that there
was no sugar, or some revolting scandal would come to her ears, or
her guests would fall to quarrelling among themselves – she would
only shake her curls, and say, ‘What does it matter?’ and care
little enough about it.</p>
<p>But my blood, anyway, was sometimes on fire with indignation
when Malevsky approached her, with a sly, fox-like action, leaned
gracefully on the back of her chair, and began whispering in her
ear with a self-satisfied and ingratiating little smile, while she
folded her arms across her bosom, looked intently at him and smiled
too, and shook her head.</p>
<p>‘What induces you to receive Count Malevsky?’ I asked her one
day.</p>
<p>‘He has such pretty moustaches,’ she answered. ‘But that’s
rather beyond you.’</p>
<p>‘You needn’t think I care for him,’ she said to me another time.
‘No; I can’t care for people I have to look down upon. I must have
some one who can master me… . But, merciful heavens, I hope I may
never come across any one like that! I don’t want to be caught in
any one’s claws, not for anything.’</p>
<p>‘You’ll never be in love, then?’</p>
<p>‘And you? Don’t I love you?’ she said, and she flicked me on the
nose with the tip of her glove.</p>
<p>Yes, Zinaïda amused herself hugely at my expense. For three
weeks I saw her every day, and what didn’t she do with me! She
rarely came to see us, and I was not sorry for it; in our house she
was transformed into a young lady, a young princess, and I was a
little overawed by her. I was afraid of betraying myself before my
mother; she had taken a great dislike to Zinaïda, and kept a
hostile eye upon us. My father I was not so much afraid of; he
seemed not to notice me. He talked little to her, but always with
special cleverness and significance. I gave up working and reading;
I even gave up walking about the neighbourhood and riding my horse.
Like a beetle tied by the leg, I moved continually round and round
my beloved little lodge. I would gladly have stopped there
altogether, it seemed&#160;… but that was impossible. My mother
scolded me, and sometimes Zinaïda herself drove me away. Then I
used to shut myself up in my room, or go down to the very end of
the garden, and climbing into what was left of a tall stone
greenhouse, now in ruins, sit for hours with my legs hanging over
the wall that looked on to the road, gazing and gazing and seeing
nothing. White butterflies flitted lazily by me, over the dusty
nettles; a saucy sparrow settled not far off on the half crumbling
red brickwork and twittered irritably, incessantly twisting and
turning and preening his tail-feathers; the still mistrustful rooks
cawed now and then, sitting high, high up on the bare top of a
birch-tree; the sun and wind played softly on its pliant branches;
the tinkle of the bells of the Don monastery floated across to me
from time to time, peaceful and dreary; while I sat, gazed,
listened, and was filled full of a nameless sensation in which all
was contained: sadness and joy and the foretaste of the future, and
the desire and dread of life. But at that time I understood nothing
of it, and could have given a name to nothing of all that was
passing at random within me, or should have called it all by one
name – the name of Zinaïda.</p>
<p>Zinaïda continued to play cat and mouse with me. She flirted
with me, and I was all agitation and rapture; then she would
suddenly thrust me away, and I dared not go near her – dared not
look at her.</p>
<p>I remember she was very cold to me for several days together; I
was completely crushed, and creeping timidly to their lodge, tried
to keep close to the old princess, regardless of the circumstance
that she was particularly scolding and grumbling just at that time;
her financial affairs had been going badly, and she had already had
two ‘explanations’ with the police officials.</p>
<p>One day I was walking in the garden beside the familiar fence,
and I caught sight of Zinaïda; leaning on both arms, she was
sitting on the grass, not stirring a muscle. I was about to make
off cautiously, but she suddenly raised her head and beckoned me
imperiously. My heart failed me; I did not understand her at first.
She repeated her signal. I promptly jumped over the fence and ran
joyfully up to her, but she brought me to a halt with a look, and
motioned me to the path two paces from her. In confusion, not
knowing what to do, I fell on my knees at the edge of the path. She
was so pale, such bitter suffering, such intense weariness, was
expressed in every feature of her face, that it sent a pang to my
heart, and I muttered unconsciously, ‘What is the matter?’</p>
<p>Zinaïda stretched out her head, picked a blade of grass, bit it
and flung it away from her.</p>
<p>‘You love me very much?’ she asked at last. ‘Yes.’</p>
<p>I made no answer – indeed, what need was there to answer?</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ she repeated, looking at me as before. ‘That’s so. The
same eyes,’ – she went on; sank into thought, and hid her face in
her hands. ‘Everything’s grown so loathsome to me,’ she whispered,
‘I would have gone to the other end of the world first – I can’t
bear it, I can’t get over it… . And what is there before me!… Ah, I
am wretched… . My God, how wretched I am!’</p>
<p>‘What for?’ I asked timidly.</p>
<p>Zinaïda made no answer, she simply shrugged her shoulders. I
remained kneeling, gazing at her with intense sadness. Every word
she had uttered simply cut me to the heart. At that instant I felt
I would gladly have given my life, if only she should not grieve. I
gazed at her – and though I could not understand why she was
wretched, I vividly pictured to myself, how in a fit of
insupportable anguish, she had suddenly come out into the garden,
and sunk to the earth, as though mown down by a scythe. It was all
bright and green about her; the wind was whispering in the leaves
of the trees, and swinging now and then a long branch of a
raspberry bush over Zinaïda’s head. There was a sound of the cooing
of doves, and the bees hummed, flying low over the scanty grass,
Overhead the sun was radiantly blue – while I was so sorrowful…
.</p>
<p>‘Read me some poetry,’ said Zinaïda in an undertone, and she
propped herself on her elbow; ‘I like your reading poetry. You read
it in sing-song, but that’s no matter, that comes of being young.
Read me “On the Hills of Georgia.” Only sit down first.’</p>
<p>I sat down and read ‘On the Hills of Georgia.’</p>
<p>‘”That the heart cannot choose but love,”’ repeated Zinaïda.
‘That’s where poetry’s so fine; it tells us what is not, and what’s
not only better than what is, but much more like the truth, “cannot
choose but love,” – it might want not to, but it can’t help it.’
She was silent again, then all at once she started and got up.
‘Come along. Meidanov’s indoors with mamma, he brought me his poem,
but I deserted him. His feelings are hurt too now&#160;… I can’t
help it! you’ll understand it all some day&#160;… only don’t be
angry with me!’</p>
<p>Zinaïda hurriedly pressed my hand and ran on ahead. We went back
into the lodge. Meidanov set to reading us his ‘Manslayer,’ which
had just appeared in print, but I did not hear him. He screamed and
drawled his four-foot iambic lines, the alternating rhythms jingled
like little bells, noisy and meaningless, while I still watched
Zinaïda and tried to take in the import of her last words.</p>
<p>‘Perchance some unknown rival Has surprised and mastered
thee?’</p>
<p>Meidanov bawled suddenly through his nose – and my eyes and
Zinaïda’s met. She looked down and faintly blushed. I saw her
blush, and grew cold with terror. I had been jealous before, but
only at that instant the idea of her being in love flashed upon my
mind. ‘Good God! she is in love!’</p>
