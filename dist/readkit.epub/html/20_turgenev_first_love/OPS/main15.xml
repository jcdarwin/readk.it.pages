<p>For the next five or six days I hardly saw Zinaïda; she said she
was ill, which did not, however, prevent the usual visitors from
calling at the lodge to pay – as they expressed it, their duty –
all, that is, except Meidanov, who promptly grew dejected and sulky
when he had not an opportunity of being enthusiastic. Byelovzorov
sat sullen and red-faced in a corner, buttoned up to the throat; on
the refined face of Malevsky there flickered continually an evil
smile; he had really fallen into disfavour with Zinaïda, and waited
with special assiduity on the old princess, and even went with her
in a hired coach to call on the Governor-General. This expedition
turned out unsuccessful, however, and even led to an unpleasant
experience for Malevsky; he was reminded of some scandal to do with
certain officers of the engineers, and was forced in his
explanations to plead his youth and inexperience at the time.
Lushin came twice a day, but did not stay long; I was rather afraid
of him after our last unreserved conversation, and at the same time
felt a genuine attraction to him. He went a walk with me one day in
the Neskutchny gardens, was very good-natured and nice, told me the
names and properties of various plants and flowers, and suddenly,
apropos of nothing at all, cried, hitting himself on his forehead,
‘And I, poor fool, thought her a flirt! it’s clear self-sacrifice
is sweet for some people!’</p>
<p>‘What do you mean by that?’ I inquired.</p>
<p>‘I don’t mean to tell you anything,’ Lushin replied
abruptly.</p>
<p>Zinaïda avoided me; my presence – I could not help noticing it –
affected her disagreeably. She involuntarily turned away from
me&#160;… involuntarily; that was what was so bitter, that was what
crushed me! But there was no help for it, and I tried not to cross
her path, and only to watch her from a distance, in which I was not
always successful. As before, something incomprehensible was
happening to her; her face was different, she was different
altogether. I was specially struck by the change that had taken
place in her one warm still evening. I was sitting on a low garden
bench under a spreading elderbush; I was fond of that nook; I could
see from there the window of Zinaïda’s room. I sat there; over my
head a little bird was busily hopping about in the darkness of the
leaves; a grey cat, stretching herself at full length, crept warily
about the garden, and the first beetles were heavily droning in the
air, which was still clear, though it was not light. I sat and
gazed at the window, and waited to see if it would open; it did
open, and Zinaïda appeared at it. She had on a white dress, and she
herself, her face, shoulders, and arms, were pale to whiteness. She
stayed a long while without moving, and looked out straight before
her from under her knitted brows. I had never known such a look on
her. Then she clasped her hands tightly, raised them to her lips,
to her forehead, and suddenly pulling her fingers apart, she pushed
back her hair behind her ears, tossed it, and with a sort of
determination nodded her head, and slammed-to the window.</p>
<p>Three days later she met me in the garden. I was turning away,
but she stopped me of herself.</p>
<p>‘Give me your arm,’ she said to me with her old
affectionateness, ‘it’s a long while since we have had a talk
together.’</p>
<p>I stole a look at her; her eyes were full of a soft light, and
her face seemed as it were smiling through a mist.</p>
<p>‘Are you still not well?’ I asked her.</p>
<p>‘No, that’s all over now,’ she answered, and she picked a small
red rose. ‘I am a little tired, but that too will pass off.’</p>
<p>‘And will you be as you used to be again?’ I asked.</p>
<p>Zinaïda put the rose up to her face, and I fancied the
reflection of its bright petals had fallen on her cheeks. ‘Why, am
I changed?’ she questioned me.</p>
<p>‘Yes, you are changed,’ I answered in a low voice.</p>
<p>‘I have been cold to you, I know,’ began Zinaïda, ‘but you
mustn’t pay attention to that&#160;… I couldn’t help it… . Come,
why talk about it!’</p>
<p>‘You don’t want me to love you, that’s what it is!’ I cried
gloomily, in an involuntary outburst.</p>
<p>‘No, love me, but not as you did.’</p>
<p>‘How then?’</p>
<p>‘Let us be friends – come now!’ Zinaïda gave me the rose to
smell. ‘Listen, you know I’m much older than you – I might be your
aunt, really; well, not your aunt, but an older sister. And
you&#160;… ’</p>
<p>‘You think me a child,’ I interrupted.</p>
<p>‘Well, yes, a child, but a dear, good clever one, whom I love
very much. Do you know what? From this day forth I confer on you
the rank of page to me; and don’t you forget that pages have to
keep close to their ladies. Here is the token of your new dignity,’
she added, sticking the rose in the buttonhole of my jacket, ‘the
token of my favour.’</p>
<p>‘I once received other favours from you,’ I muttered.</p>
<p>‘Ah!’ commented Zinaïda, and she gave me a sidelong look, ‘What
a memory he has! Well? I’m quite ready now&#160;… ’ And stooping to
me, she imprinted on my forehead a pure, tranquil kiss.</p>
<p>I only looked at her, while she turned away, and saying, ‘Follow
me, my page,’ went into the lodge. I followed her – all in
amazement. ‘Can this gentle, reasonable girl,’ I thought, ‘be the
Zinaïda I used to know?’ I fancied her very walk was quieter, her
whole figure statelier and more graceful&#160;…</p>
<p>And, mercy! with what fresh force love burned within me!</p>
