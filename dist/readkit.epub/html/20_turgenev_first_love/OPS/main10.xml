<p>My real torments began from that instant. I racked my brains,
changed my mind, and changed it back again, and kept an
unremitting, though, as far as possible, secret watch on Zinaïda. A
change had come over her, that was obvious. She began going walks
alone – and long walks. Sometimes she would not see visitors; she
would sit for hours together in her room. This had never been a
habit of hers till now. I suddenly became – or fancied I had become
– extraordinarily penetrating.</p>
<p>‘Isn’t it he? or isn’t it he?’ I asked myself, passing in inward
agitation from one of her admirers to another. Count Malevsky
secretly struck me as more to be feared than the others, though,
for Zinaïda’s sake, I was ashamed to confess it to myself.</p>
<p>My watchfulness did not see beyond the end of my nose, and its
secrecy probably deceived no one; any way, Doctor Lushin soon saw
through me. But he, too, had changed of late; he had grown thin, he
laughed as often, but his laugh seemed more hollow, more spiteful,
shorter, an involuntary nervous irritability took the place of his
former light irony and assumed cynicism.</p>
<p>‘Why are you incessantly hanging about here, young man?’ he said
to me one day, when we were left alone together in the Zasyekins’
drawing-room. (The young princess had not come home from a walk,
and the shrill voice of the old princess could be heard within; she
was scolding the maid.) ‘You ought to be studying, working – while
you’re young – and what are you doing?’</p>
<p>‘You can’t tell whether I work at home,’ I retorted with some
haughtiness, but also with some hesitation.</p>
<p>‘A great deal of work you do! that’s not what you’re thinking
about! Well, I won’t find fault with that&#160;… at your age that’s
in the natural order of things. But you’ve been awfully unlucky in
your choice. Don’t you see what this house is?’</p>
<p>‘I don’t understand you,’ I observed.</p>
<p>‘You don’t understand? so much the worse for you. I regard it as
a duty to warn you. Old bachelors, like me, can come here, what
harm can it do us! we’re tough, nothing can hurt us, what harm can
it do us; but your skin’s tender yet – this air is bad for you –
believe me, you may get harm from it.’</p>
<p>‘How so?’</p>
<p>‘Why, are you well now? Are you in a normal condition? Is what
you’re feeling – beneficial to you – good for you?’</p>
<p>‘Why, what am I feeling?’ I said, while in my heart I knew the
doctor was right.</p>
<p>‘Ah, young man, young man,’ the doctor went on with an
intonation that suggested that something highly insulting to me was
contained in these two words, ‘what’s the use of your
prevaricating, when, thank God, what’s in your heart is in your
face, so far? But there, what’s the use of talking? I shouldn’t
come here myself, if&#160;… (the doctor compressed his lips)&#160;…
if I weren’t such a queer fellow. Only this is what surprises me;
how it is, you, with your intelligence, don’t see what is going on
around you?’</p>
<p>‘And what is going on?’ I put in, all on the alert.</p>
<p>The doctor looked at me with a sort of ironical compassion.</p>
<p>‘Nice of me!’ he said as though to himself, ‘as if he need know
anything of it. In fact, I tell you again,’ he added, raising his
voice, ‘the atmosphere here is not fit for you. You like being
here, but what of that! it’s nice and sweet-smelling in a
greenhouse – but there’s no living in it. Yes! do as I tell you,
and go back to your Keidanov.’</p>
<p>The old princess came in, and began complaining to the doctor of
her toothache. Then Zinaïda appeared.</p>
<p>‘Come,’ said the old princess, ‘you must scold her, doctor.
She’s drinking iced water all day long; is that good for her, pray,
with her delicate chest?’</p>
<p>‘Why do you do that?’ asked Lushin.</p>
<p>‘Why, what effect could it have?’</p>
<p>‘What effect? You might get a chill and die.’</p>
<p>‘Truly? Do you mean it? Very well – so much the better.’</p>
<p>‘A fine idea!’ muttered the doctor. The old princess had gone
out.</p>
<p>‘Yes, a fine idea,’ repeated Zinaïda. ‘Is life such a festive
affair? Just look about you… . Is it nice, eh? Or do you imagine I
don’t understand it, and don’t feel it? It gives me pleasure –
drinking iced water; and can you seriously assure me that such a
life is worth too much to be risked for an instant’s pleasure –
happiness I won’t even talk about.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, very well,’ remarked Lushin, ‘caprice and irresponsibility…
. Those two words sum you up; your whole nature’s contained in
those two words.’</p>
<p>Zinaïda laughed nervously.</p>
<p>‘You’re late for the post, my dear doctor. You don’t keep a good
look-out; you’re behind the times. Put on your spectacles. I’m in
no capricious humour now. To make fools of you, to make a fool of
myself&#160;… much fun there is in that! – and as for
irresponsibility&#160;… M’sieu Voldemar,’ Zinaïda added suddenly,
stamping, ‘don’t make such a melancholy face. I can’t endure people
to pity me.’ She went quickly out of the room.</p>
<p>‘It’s bad for you, very bad for you, this atmosphere, young
man,’ Lushin said to me once more.</p>
