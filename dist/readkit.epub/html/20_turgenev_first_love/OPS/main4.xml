<p>In the narrow and untidy passage of the lodge, which I entered
with an involuntary tremor in all my limbs, I was met by an old
grey-headed servant with a dark copper-coloured face, surly little
pig’s eyes, and such deep furrows on his forehead and temples as I
had never beheld in my life. He was carrying a plate containing the
spine of a herring that had been gnawed at; and shutting the door
that led into the room with his foot, he jerked out, ‘What do you
want?’</p>
<p>‘Is the Princess Zasyekin at home?’ I inquired.</p>
<p>‘Vonifaty!’ a jarring female voice screamed from within.</p>
<p>The man without a word turned his back on me, exhibiting as he
did so the extremely threadbare hindpart of his livery with a
solitary reddish heraldic button on it; he put the plate down on
the floor, and went away.</p>
<p>‘Did you go to the police station?’ the same female voice called
again. The man muttered something in reply. ‘Eh… . Has some one
come?’ I heard again… . ‘The young gentleman from next door. Ask
him in, then.’</p>
<p>‘Will you step into the drawing-room?’ said the servant, making
his appearance once more, and picking up the plate from the floor.
I mastered my emotions, and went into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>I found myself in a small and not over clean apartment,
containing some poor furniture that looked as if it had been
hurriedly set down where it stood. At the window in an easy-chair
with a broken arm was sitting a woman of fifty, bareheaded and
ugly, in an old green dress, and a striped worsted wrap about her
neck. Her small black eyes fixed me like pins.</p>
<p>I went up to her and bowed.</p>
<p>‘I have the honour of addressing the Princess Zasyekin?’</p>
<p>‘I am the Princess Zasyekin; and you are the son of Mr. V.?’</p>
<p>‘Yes. I have come to you with a message from my mother.’</p>
<p>‘Sit down, please. Vonifaty, where are my keys, have you seen
them?’</p>
<p>I communicated to Madame Zasyekin my mother’s reply to her note.
She heard me out, drumming with her fat red fingers on the
window-pane, and when I had finished, she stared at me once
more.</p>
<p>‘Very good; I’ll be sure to come,’ she observed at last. ‘But
how young you are! How old are you, may I ask?’</p>
<p>‘Sixteen,’ I replied, with an involuntary stammer.</p>
<p>The princess drew out of her pocket some greasy papers covered
with writing, raised them right up to her nose, and began looking
through them.</p>
<p>‘A good age,’ she ejaculated suddenly, turning round restlessly
on her chair. ‘And do you, pray, make yourself at home. I don’t
stand on ceremony.’</p>
<p>‘No, indeed,’ I thought, scanning her unprepossessing person
with a disgust I could not restrain.</p>
<p>At that instant another door flew open quickly, and in the
doorway stood the girl I had seen the previous evening in the
garden. She lifted her hand, and a mocking smile gleamed in her
face.</p>
<p>‘Here is my daughter,’ observed the princess, indicating her
with her elbow. ‘Zinotchka, the son of our neighbour, Mr. V. What
is your name, allow me to ask?’</p>
<p>‘Vladimir,’ I answered, getting up, and stuttering in my
excitement.</p>
<p>‘And your father’s name?’</p>
<p>‘Petrovitch.’</p>
<p>‘Ah! I used to know a commissioner of police whose name was
Vladimir Petrovitch too. Vonifaty! don’t look for my keys; the keys
are in my pocket.’</p>
<p>The young girl was still looking at me with the same smile,
faintly fluttering her eyelids, and putting her head a little on
one side.</p>
<p>‘I have seen Monsieur Voldemar before,’ she began. (The silvery
note of her voice ran through me with a sort of sweet shiver.) ‘You
will let me call you so?’</p>
<p>‘Oh, please,’ I faltered.</p>
<p>‘Where was that?’ asked the princess.</p>
<p>The young princess did not answer her mother.</p>
<p>‘Have you anything to do just now?’ she said, not taking her
eyes off me.</p>
<p>‘Oh, no.’</p>
<p>‘Would you like to help me wind some wool? Come in here, to
me.’</p>
<p>She nodded to me and went out of the drawing-room. I followed
her.</p>
<p>In the room we went into, the furniture was a little better, and
was arranged with more taste. Though, indeed, at the moment, I was
scarcely capable of noticing anything; I moved as in a dream and
felt all through my being a sort of intense blissfulness that
verged on imbecility.</p>
<p>The young princess sat down, took out a skein of red wool and,
motioning me to a seat opposite her, carefully untied the skein and
laid it across my hands. All this she did in silence with a sort of
droll deliberation and with the same bright sly smile on her
slightly parted lips. She began to wind the wool on a bent card,
and all at once she dazzled me with a glance so brilliant and
rapid, that I could not help dropping my eyes. When her eyes, which
were generally half closed, opened to their full extent, her face
was completely transfigured; it was as though it were flooded with
light.</p>
<p>‘What did you think of me yesterday, M’sieu Voldemar?’ she asked
after a brief pause. ‘You thought ill of me, I expect?’</p>
<p>‘I&#160;… princess&#160;… I thought nothing&#160;… how can I?… ’
I answered in confusion.</p>
<p>‘Listen,’ she rejoined. ‘You don’t know me yet. I’m a very
strange person; I like always to be told the truth. You, I have
just heard, are sixteen, and I am twenty-one: you see I’m a great
deal older than you, and so you ought always to tell me the
truth&#160;… and to do what I tell you,’ she added. ‘Look at me:
why don’t you look at me?’</p>
<p>I was still more abashed; however, I raised my eyes to her. She
smiled, not her former smile, but a smile of approbation. ‘Look at
me,’ she said, dropping her voice caressingly: ‘I don’t dislike
that&#160;… I like your face; I have a presentiment we shall be
friends. But do you like me?’ she added slyly.</p>
<p>‘Princess&#160;… ’ I was beginning.</p>
<p>‘In the first place, you must call me Zinaïda Alexandrovna, and
in the second place it’s a bad habit for children’ – (she corrected
herself) ‘for young people – not to say straight out what they
feel. That’s all very well for grown-up people. You like me, don’t
you?’</p>
<p>Though I was greatly delighted that she talked so freely to me,
still I was a little hurt. I wanted to show her that she had not a
mere boy to deal with, and assuming as easy and serious an air as I
could, I observed, ‘Certainly. I like you very much, Zinaïda
Alexandrovna; I have no wish to conceal it.’</p>
<p>She shook her head very deliberately. ‘Have you a tutor?’ she
asked suddenly.</p>
<p>‘No; I’ve not had a tutor for a long, long while.’</p>
<p>I told a lie; it was not a month since I had parted with my
Frenchman.</p>
<p>‘Oh! I see then – you are quite grown-up.’</p>
<p>She tapped me lightly on the fingers. ‘Hold your hands
straight!’ And she applied herself busily to winding the ball.</p>
<p>I seized the opportunity when she was looking down and fell to
watching her, at first stealthily, then more and more boldly. Her
face struck me as even more charming than on the previous evening;
everything in it was so delicate, clever, and sweet. She was
sitting with her back to a window covered with a white blind, the
sunshine, streaming in through the blind, shed a soft light over
her fluffy golden curls, her innocent neck, her sloping shoulders,
and tender untroubled bosom. I gazed at her, and how dear and near
she was already to me! It seemed to me I had known her a long while
and had never known anything nor lived at all till I met her… . She
was wearing a dark and rather shabby dress and an apron; I would
gladly, I felt, have kissed every fold of that dress and apron. The
tips of her little shoes peeped out from under her skirt; I could
have bowed down in adoration to those shoes… . ‘And here I am
sitting before her,’ I thought; ‘I have made acquaintance with
her&#160;… what happiness, my God!’ I could hardly keep from
jumping up from my chair in ecstasy, but I only swung my legs a
little, like a small child who has been given sweetmeats.</p>
<p>I was as happy as a fish in water, and I could have stayed in
that room for ever, have never left that place.</p>
<p>Her eyelids were slowly lifted, and once more her clear eyes
shone kindly upon me, and again she smiled.</p>
<p>‘How you look at me!’ she said slowly, and she held up a
threatening finger.</p>
<p>I blushed&#160;… ‘She understands it all, she sees all,’ flashed
through my mind. ‘And how could she fail to understand and see it
all?’</p>
<p>All at once there was a sound in the next room – the clink of a
sabre.</p>
<p>‘Zina!’ screamed the princess in the drawing-room, ‘Byelovzorov
has brought you a kitten.’</p>
<p>‘A kitten!’ cried Zinaïda, and getting up from her chair
impetuously, she flung the ball of worsted on my knees and ran
away.</p>
<p>I too got up and, laying the skein and the ball of wool on the
window-sill, I went into the drawing-room and stood still,
hesitating. In the middle of the room, a tabby kitten was lying
with outstretched paws; Zinaïda was on her knees before it,
cautiously lifting up its little face. Near the old princess, and
filling up almost the whole space between the two windows, was a
flaxen curly-headed young man, a hussar, with a rosy face and
prominent eyes.</p>
<p>‘What a funny little thing!’ Zinaïda was saying; ‘and its eyes
are not grey, but green, and what long ears! Thank you, Viktor
Yegoritch! you are very kind.’</p>
<p>The hussar, in whom I recognised one of the young men I had seen
the evening before, smiled and bowed with a clink of his spurs and
a jingle of the chain of his sabre.</p>
<p>‘You were pleased to say yesterday that you wished to possess a
tabby kitten with long ears&#160;… so I obtained it. Your word is
law.’ And he bowed again.</p>
<p>The kitten gave a feeble mew and began sniffing the ground.</p>
<p>‘It’s hungry!’ cried Zinaïda. ‘Vonifaty, Sonia! bring some
milk.’</p>
<p>A maid, in an old yellow gown with a faded kerchief at her neck,
came in with a saucer of milk and set it before the kitten. The
kitten started, blinked, and began lapping.</p>
<p>‘What a pink little tongue it has!’ remarked Zinaïda, putting
her head almost on the ground and peeping at it sideways under its
very nose.</p>
<p>The kitten having had enough began to purr and move its paws
affectedly. Zinaïda got up, and turning to the maid said
carelessly, ‘Take it away.’</p>
<p>‘For the kitten – your little hand,’ said the hussar, with a
simper and a shrug of his strongly-built frame, which was tightly
buttoned up in a new uniform.</p>
<p>‘Both,’ replied Zinaïda, and she held out her hands to him.
While he was kissing them, she looked at me over his shoulder.</p>
<p>I stood stockstill in the same place and did not know whether to
laugh, to say something, or to be silent. Suddenly through the open
door into the passage I caught sight of our footman, Fyodor. He was
making signs to me. Mechanically I went out to him.</p>
<p>‘What do you want?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘Your mamma has sent for you,’ he said in a whisper. ‘She is
angry that you have not come back with the answer.’</p>
<p>‘Why, have I been here long?’</p>
<p>‘Over an hour.’</p>
<p>‘Over an hour!’ I repeated unconsciously, and going back to the
drawing-room I began to make bows and scrape with my heels.</p>
<p>‘Where are you off to?’ the young princess asked, glancing at me
from behind the hussar.</p>
<p>‘I must go home. So I am to say,’ I added, addressing the old
lady, ‘that you will come to us about two.’</p>
<p>‘Do you say so, my good sir.’</p>
<p>The princess hurriedly pulled out her snuff-box and took snuff
so loudly that I positively jumped. ‘Do you say so,’ she repeated,
blinking tearfully and sneezing.</p>
<p>I bowed once more, turned, and went out of the room with that
sensation of awkwardness in my spine which a very young man feels
when he knows he is being looked at from behind.</p>
<p>‘Mind you come and see us again, M’sieu Voldemar,’ Zinaïda
called, and she laughed again.</p>
<p>‘Why is it she’s always laughing?’ I thought, as I went back
home escorted by Fyodor, who said nothing to me, but walked behind
me with an air of disapprobation. My mother scolded me and wondered
what ever I could have been doing so long at the princess’s. I made
her no reply and went off to my own room. I felt suddenly very sad…
. I tried hard not to cry… . I was jealous of the hussar.</p>
