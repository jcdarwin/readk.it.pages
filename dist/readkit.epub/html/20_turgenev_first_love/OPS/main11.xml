<p>On the evening of the same day the usual guests were assembled
at the Zasyekins’. I was among them.</p>
<p>The conversation turned on Meidanov’s poem. Zinaïda expressed
genuine admiration of it. ‘But do you know what?’ she said to him.
‘If I were a poet, I would choose quite different subjects. Perhaps
it’s all nonsense, but strange ideas sometimes come into my head,
especially when I’m not asleep in the early morning, when the sky
begins to turn rosy and grey both at once. I would, for
instance&#160;… You won’t laugh at me?’</p>
<p>‘No, no!’ we all cried, with one voice.</p>
<p>‘I would describe,’ she went on, folding her arms across her
bosom and looking away, ‘a whole company of young girls at night in
a great boat, on a silent river. The moon is shining, and they are
all in white, and wearing garlands of white flowers, and singing,
you know, something in the nature of a hymn.’</p>
<p>‘I see – I see; go on,’ Meidanov commented with dreamy
significance.</p>
<p>‘All of a sudden, loud clamour, laughter, torches, tambourines
on the bank… . It’s a troop of Bacchantes dancing with songs and
cries. It’s your business to make a picture of it, Mr. Poet;… only
I should like the torches to be red and to smoke a great deal, and
the Bacchantes’ eyes to gleam under their wreaths, and the wreaths
to be dusky. Don’t forget the tiger-skins, too, and goblets and
gold – lots of gold… .’</p>
<p>‘Where ought the gold to be?’ asked Meidanov, tossing back his
sleek hair and distending his nostrils.</p>
<p>‘Where? on their shoulders and arms and legs – everywhere. They
say in ancient times women wore gold rings on their ankles. The
Bacchantes call the girls in the boat to them. The girls have
ceased singing their hymn – they cannot go on with it, but they do
not stir, the river carries them to the bank. And suddenly one of
them slowly rises… . This you must describe nicely: how she slowly
gets up in the moonlight, and how her companions are afraid… . She
steps over the edge of the boat, the Bacchantes surround her, whirl
her away into night and darkness… . Here put in smoke in clouds and
everything in confusion. There is nothing but the sound of their
shrill cry, and her wreath left lying on the bank.’</p>
<p>Zinaïda ceased. (‘Oh! she is in love!’ I thought again.)</p>
<p>‘And is that all?’ asked Meidanov.</p>
<p>‘That’s all.’</p>
<p>‘That can’t be the subject of a whole poem,’ he observed
pompously, ‘but I will make use of your idea for a lyrical
fragment.’</p>
<p>‘In the romantic style?’ queried Malevsky.</p>
<p>‘Of course, in the romantic style – Byronic.’</p>
<p>‘Well, to my mind, Hugo beats Byron,’ the young count observed
negligently; ‘he’s more interesting.’</p>
<p>‘Hugo is a writer of the first class,’ replied Meidanov; ‘and my
friend, Tonkosheev, in his Spanish romance, <em>El
Trovador</em>&#160;… ’</p>
<p>‘Ah! is that the book with the question-marks turned upside
down?’ Zinaïda interrupted.</p>
<p>‘Yes. That’s the custom with the Spanish. I was about to observe
that Tonkosheev&#160;… ’</p>
<p>‘Come! you’re going to argue about classicism and romanticism
again,’ Zinaïda interrupted him a second time.’ We’d much better
play&#160;…</p>
<p>‘Forfeits?’ put in Lushin.</p>
<p>‘No, forfeits are a bore; at comparisons.’ (This game Zinaïda
had invented herself. Some object was mentioned, every one tried to
compare it with something, and the one who chose the best
comparison got a prize.)</p>
<p>She went up to the window. The sun was just setting; high up in
the sky were large red clouds.</p>
<p>‘What are those clouds like?’ questioned Zinaïda; and without
waiting for our answer, she said, ‘I think they are like the purple
sails on the golden ship of Cleopatra, when she sailed to meet
Antony. Do you remember, Meidanov, you were telling me about it not
long ago?’</p>
<p>All of us, like Polonius in <em>Hamlet</em>, opined that the
clouds recalled nothing so much as those sails, and that not one of
us could discover a better comparison.</p>
<p>‘And how old was Antony then?’ inquired Zinaïda.</p>
<p>‘A young man, no doubt,’ observed Malevsky.</p>
<p>‘Yes, a young man,’ Meidanov chimed in in confirmation.</p>
<p>‘Excuse me,’ cried Lushin, ‘he was over forty.’</p>
<p>‘Over forty,’ repeated Zinaïda, giving him a rapid glance… .</p>
<p>I soon went home. ‘She is in love,’ my lips unconsciously
repeated… . ‘But with whom?’</p>
