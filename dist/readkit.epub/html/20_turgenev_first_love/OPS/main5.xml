<p>The princess called on my mother as she had promised and made a
disagreeable impression on her. I was not present at their
interview, but at table my mother told my father that this Prince
Zasyekin struck her as a <em>femme très vulgaire</em>, that she had
quite worn her out begging her to interest Prince Sergei in their
behalf, that she seemed to have no end of lawsuits and affairs on
hand – <em>de vilaines affaires d’argent</em> – and must be a very
troublesome and litigious person. My mother added, however, that
she had asked her and her daughter to dinner the next day (hearing
the word ‘daughter’ I buried my nose in my plate), for after all
she was a neighbour and a person of title. Upon this my father
informed my mother that he remembered now who this lady was; that
he had in his youth known the deceased Prince Zasyekin, a very
well-bred, but frivolous and absurd person; that he had been
nicknamed in society ‘<em>le Parisien</em>,’ from having lived a
long while in Paris; that he had been very rich, but had gambled
away all his property; and for some unknown reason, probably for
money, though indeed he might have chosen better, if so, my father
added with a cold smile, he had married the daughter of an agent,
and after his marriage had entered upon speculations and ruined
himself utterly.</p>
<p>‘If only she doesn’t try to borrow money,’ observed my
mother.</p>
<p>‘That’s exceedingly possible,’ my father responded tranquilly.
‘Does she speak French?’</p>
<p>‘Very badly.’</p>
<p>‘H’m. It’s of no consequence anyway. I think you said you had
asked the daughter too; some one was telling me she was a very
charming and cultivated girl.’</p>
<p>‘Ah! Then she can’t take after her mother.’</p>
<p>‘Nor her father either,’ rejoined my father. ‘He was cultivated
indeed, but a fool.’</p>
<p>My mother sighed and sank into thought. My father said no more.
I felt very uncomfortable during this conversation.</p>
<p>After dinner I went into the garden, but without my gun. I swore
to myself that I would not go near the Zasyekins’ garden, but an
irresistible force drew me thither, and not in vain. I had hardly
reached the fence when I caught sight of Zinaïda. This time she was
alone. She held a book in her hands, and was coming slowly along
the path. She did not notice me.</p>
<p>I almost let her pass by; but all at once I changed my mind and
coughed.</p>
<p>She turned round, but did not stop, pushed back with one hand
the broad blue ribbon of her round straw hat, looked at me, smiled
slowly, and again bent her eyes on the book.</p>
<p>I took off my cap, and after hesitating a moment, walked away
with a heavy heart. ‘<em>Que suis-je pour elle?</em>’ I thought
(God knows why) in French.</p>
<p>Familiar footsteps sounded behind me; I looked round, my father
came up to me with his light, rapid walk.</p>
<p>‘Is that the young princess?’ he asked me.</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘Why, do you know her?’</p>
<p>‘I saw her this morning at the princess’s.’</p>
<p>My father stopped, and, turning sharply on his heel, went back.
When he was on a level with Zinaïda, he made her a courteous bow.
She, too, bowed to him, with some astonishment on her face, and
dropped her book. I saw how she looked after him. My father was
always irreproachably dressed, simple and in a style of his own;
but his figure had never struck me as more graceful, never had his
grey hat sat more becomingly on his curls, which were scarcely
perceptibly thinner than they had once been.</p>
<p>I bent my steps toward Zinaïda, but she did not even glance at
me; she picked up her book again and went away.</p>
