<p>The party had long ago broken up. The clock struck half-past
twelve. There was left in the room only the master of the house and
Sergei Nikolaevitch and Vladimir Petrovitch.</p>
<p>The master of the house rang and ordered the remains of the
supper to be cleared away. ‘And so it’s settled,’ he observed,
sitting back farther in his easy-chair and lighting a cigar; ‘each
of us is to tell the story of his first love. It’s your turn,
Sergei Nikolaevitch.’</p>
<p>Sergei Nikolaevitch, a round little man with a plump,
light-complexioned face, gazed first at the master of the house,
then raised his eyes to the ceiling. ‘I had no first love,’ he said
at last; ‘I began with the second.’</p>
<p>‘How was that?’</p>
<p>‘It’s very simple. I was eighteen when I had my first flirtation
with a charming young lady, but I courted her just as though it
were nothing new to me; just as I courted others later on. To speak
accurately, the first and last time I was in love was with my nurse
when I was six years old; but that’s in the remote past. The
details of our relations have slipped out of my memory, and even if
I remembered them, whom could they interest?’</p>
<p>‘Then how’s it to be?’ began the master of the house. ‘There was
nothing much of interest about my first love either; I never fell
in love with any one till I met Anna Nikolaevna, now my wife, – and
everything went as smoothly as possible with us; our parents
arranged the match, we were very soon in love with each other, and
got married without loss of time. My story can be told in a couple
of words. I must confess, gentlemen, in bringing up the subject of
first love, I reckoned upon you, I won’t say old, but no longer
young, bachelors. Can’t you enliven us with something, Vladimir
Petrovitch?’</p>
<p>‘My first love, certainly, was not quite an ordinary one,’
responded, with some reluctance, Vladimir Petrovitch, a man of
forty, with black hair turning grey.</p>
<p>‘Ah!’ said the master of the house and Sergei Nikolaevitch with
one voice: ‘So much the better… . Tell us about it.’</p>
<p>‘If you wish it&#160;… or no; I won’t tell the story; I’m no
hand at telling a story; I make it dry and brief, or spun out and
affected. If you’ll allow me, I’ll write out all I remember and
read it you.’</p>
<p>His friends at first would not agree, but Vladimir Petrovitch
insisted on his own way. A fortnight later they were together
again, and Vladimir Petrovitch kept his word.</p>
<p>His manuscript contained the following story: –</p>
