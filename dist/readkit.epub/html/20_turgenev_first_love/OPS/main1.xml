<p>I was sixteen then. It happened in the summer of 1833.</p>
<p>I lived in Moscow with my parents. They had taken a country
house for the summer near the Kalouga gate, facing the Neskutchny
gardens. I was preparing for the university, but did not work much
and was in no hurry.</p>
<p>No one interfered with my freedom. I did what I liked,
especially after parting with my last tutor, a Frenchman who had
never been able to get used to the idea that he had fallen ‘like a
bomb’ (<em>comme une bombe</em>) into Russia, and would lie
sluggishly in bed with an expression of exasperation on his face
for days together. My father treated me with careless kindness; my
mother scarcely noticed me, though she had no children except me;
other cares completely absorbed her. My father, a man still young
and very handsome, had married her from mercenary considerations;
she was ten years older than he. My mother led a melancholy life;
she was for ever agitated, jealous and angry, but not in my
father’s presence; she was very much afraid of him, and he was
severe, cold, and distant in his behaviour… . I have never seen a
man more elaborately serene, self-confident, and commanding.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the first weeks I spent at the country
house. The weather was magnificent; we left town on the 9th of May,
on St. Nicholas’s day. I used to walk about in our garden, in the
Neskutchny gardens, and beyond the town gates; I would take some
book with me – Keidanov’s Course, for instance – but I rarely
looked into it, and more often than anything declaimed verses
aloud; I knew a great deal of poetry by heart; my blood was in a
ferment and my heart ached – so sweetly and absurdly; I was all
hope and anticipation, was a little frightened of something, and
full of wonder at everything, and was on the tiptoe of expectation;
my imagination played continually, fluttering rapidly about the
same fancies, like martins about a bell-tower at dawn; I dreamed,
was sad, even wept; but through the tears and through the sadness,
inspired by a musical verse, or the beauty of evening, shot up like
grass in spring the delicious sense of youth and effervescent
life.</p>
<p>I had a horse to ride; I used to saddle it myself and set off
alone for long rides, break into a rapid gallop and fancy myself a
knight at a tournament. How gaily the wind whistled in my ears! or
turning my face towards the sky, I would absorb its shining
radiance and blue into my soul, that opened wide to welcome it.</p>
<p>I remember that at that time the image of woman, the vision of
love, scarcely ever arose in definite shape in my brain; but in all
I thought, in all I felt, lay hidden a half-conscious, shamefaced
presentiment of something new, unutterably sweet, feminine… .</p>
<p>This presentiment, this expectation, permeated my whole being; I
breathed in it, it coursed through my veins with every drop of
blood&#160;… it was destined to be soon fulfilled.</p>
<p>The place, where we settled for the summer, consisted of a
wooden manor-house with columns and two small lodges; in the lodge
on the left there was a tiny factory for the manufacture of cheap
wall-papers… . I had more than once strolled that way to look at
about a dozen thin and dishevelled boys with greasy smocks and worn
faces, who were perpetually jumping on to wooden levers, that
pressed down the square blocks of the press, and so by the weight
of their feeble bodies struck off the variegated patterns of the
wall-papers. The lodge on the right stood empty, and was to let.
One day – three weeks after the 9th of May – the blinds in the
windows of this lodge were drawn up, women’s faces appeared at them
– some family had installed themselves in it. I remember the same
day at dinner, my mother inquired of the butler who were our new
neighbours, and hearing the name of the Princess Zasyekin, first
observed with some respect, ‘Ah! a princess!’&#160;… and then
added, ‘A poor one, I suppose?’</p>
<p>‘They arrived in three hired flies,’ the butler remarked
deferentially, as he handed a dish: ‘they don’t keep their own
carriage, and the furniture’s of the poorest.’</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ replied my mother, ‘so much the better.’</p>
<p>My father gave her a chilly glance; she was silent.</p>
<p>Certainly the Princess Zasyekin could not be a rich woman; the
lodge she had taken was so dilapidated and small and low-pitched
that people, even moderately well-off in the world, would hardly
have consented to occupy it. At the time, however, all this went in
at one ear and out at the other. The princely title had very little
effect on me; I had just been reading Schiller’s
<em>Robbers</em>.</p>
