<p>At eight o’clock precisely, in my tail-coat and with my hair
brushed up into a tuft on my head, I entered the passage of the
lodge, where the princess lived. The old servant looked crossly at
me and got up unwillingly from his bench. There was a sound of
merry voices in the drawing-room. I opened the door and fell back
in amazement. In the middle of the room was the young princess,
standing on a chair, holding a man’s hat in front of her; round the
chair crowded some half a dozen men. They were trying to put their
hands into the hat, while she held it above their heads, shaking it
violently. On seeing me, she cried, ‘Stay, stay, another guest, he
must have a ticket too,’ and leaping lightly down from the chair
she took me by the cuff of my coat ‘Come along,’ she said, ‘why are
you standing still? <em>Messieurs</em>, let me make you acquainted:
this is M’sieu Voldemar, the son of our neighbour. And this,’ she
went on, addressing me, and indicating her guests in turn, ‘Count
Malevsky, Doctor Lushin, Meidanov the poet, the retired captain
Nirmatsky, and Byelovzorov the hussar, whom you’ve seen already. I
hope you will be good friends.’ I was so confused that I did not
even bow to any one; in Doctor Lushin I recognised the dark man who
had so mercilessly put me to shame in the garden; the others were
unknown to me.</p>
<p>‘Count!’ continued Zinaïda, ‘write M’sieu Voldemar a
ticket.’</p>
<p>‘That’s not fair,’ was objected in a slight Polish accent by the
count, a very handsome and fashionably dressed brunette, with
expressive brown eyes, a thin little white nose, and delicate
little moustaches over a tiny mouth. ‘This gentleman has not been
playing forfeits with us.’</p>
<p>‘It’s unfair,’ repeated in chorus Byelovzorov and the gentleman
described as a retired captain, a man of forty, pock-marked to a
hideous degree, curly-headed as a negro, round-shouldered,
bandy-legged, and dressed in a military coat without epaulets, worn
unbuttoned.</p>
<p>‘Write him a ticket, I tell you,’ repeated the young princess.
‘What’s this mutiny? M’sieu Voldemar is with us for the first time,
and there are no rules for him yet. It’s no use grumbling – write
it, I wish it.’</p>
<p>The count shrugged his shoulders but bowed submissively, took
the pen in his white, ring-bedecked fingers, tore off a scrap of
paper and wrote on it.</p>
<p>‘At least let us explain to Mr. Voldemar what we are about,’
Lushin began in a sarcastic voice, ‘or else he will be quite lost.
Do you see, young man, we are playing forfeits? the princess has to
pay a forfeit, and the one who draws the lucky lot is to have the
privilege of kissing her hand. Do you understand what I’ve told
you?’</p>
<p>I simply stared at him, and continued to stand still in
bewilderment, while the young princess jumped up on the chair
again, and again began waving the hat. They all stretched up to
her, and I went after the rest.</p>
<p>‘Meidanov,’ said the princess to a tall young man with a thin
face, little dim-sighted eyes, and exceedingly long black hair,
‘you as a poet ought to be magnanimous, and give up your number to
M’sieu Voldemar so that he may have two chances instead of
one.’</p>
<p>But Meidanov shook his head in refusal, and tossed his hair.
After all the others I put my hand into the hat, and unfolded my
lot… . Heavens! what was my condition when I saw on it the word,
Kiss!</p>
<p>‘Kiss!’ I could not help crying aloud.</p>
<p>‘Bravo! he has won it,’ the princess said quickly. ‘How glad I
am!’ She came down from the chair and gave me such a bright sweet
look, that my heart bounded. ‘Are you glad?’ she asked me.</p>
<p>‘Me?’&#160;… I faltered.</p>
<p>‘Sell me your lot,’ Byelovzorov growled suddenly just in my ear.
‘I’ll give you a hundred roubles.’</p>
<p>I answered the hussar with such an indignant look, that Zinaïda
clapped her hands, while Lushin cried, ‘He’s a fine fellow!’</p>
<p>‘But, as master of the ceremonies,’ he went on, ‘it’s my duty to
see that all the rules are kept. M’sieu Voldemar, go down on one
knee. That is our regulation.’</p>
<p>Zinaïda stood in front of me, her head a little on one side as
though to get a better look at me; she held out her hand to me with
dignity. A mist passed before my eyes; I meant to drop on one knee,
sank on both, and pressed my lips to Zinaïda’s fingers so awkwardly
that I scratched myself a little with the tip of her nail.</p>
<p>‘Well done!’ cried Lushin, and helped me to get up.</p>
<p>The game of forfeits went on. Zinaïda sat me down beside her.
She invented all sorts of extraordinary forfeits! She had among
other things to represent a ‘statue,’ and she chose as a pedestal
the hideous Nirmatsky, told him to bow down in an arch, and bend
his head down on his breast. The laughter never paused for an
instant. For me, a boy constantly brought up in the seclusion of a
dignified manor-house, all this noise and uproar, this
unceremonious, almost riotous gaiety, these relations with unknown
persons, were simply intoxicating. My head went round, as though
from wine. I began laughing and talking louder than the others, so
much so that the old princess, who was sitting in the next room
with some sort of clerk from the Tversky gate, invited by her for
consultation on business, positively came in to look at me. But I
felt so happy that I did not mind anything, I didn’t care a straw
for any one’s jeers, or dubious looks. Zinaïda continued to show me
a preference, and kept me at her side. In one forfeit, I had to sit
by her, both hidden under one silk handkerchief: I was to tell her
<em>my secret</em>. I remember our two heads being all at once in a
warm, half-transparent, fragrant darkness, the soft, close
brightness of her eyes in the dark, and the burning breath from her
parted lips, and the gleam of her teeth and the ends of her hair
tickling me and setting me on fire. I was silent. She smiled slyly
and mysteriously, and at last whispered to me, ‘Well, what is it?’
but I merely blushed and laughed, and turned away, catching my
breath. We got tired of forfeits – we began to play a game with a
string. My God! what were my transports when, for not paying
attention, I got a sharp and vigorous slap on my fingers from her,
and how I tried afterwards to pretend that I was absent-minded, and
she teased me, and would not touch the hands I held out to her!
What didn’t we do that evening! We played the piano, and sang and
danced and acted a gypsy encampment. Nirmatsky was dressed up as a
bear, and made to drink salt water. Count Malevsky showed us
several sorts of card tricks, and finished, after shuffling the
cards, by dealing himself all the trumps at whist, on which Lushin
‘had the honour of congratulating him.’ Meidanov recited portions
from his poem ‘The Manslayer’ (romanticism was at its height at
this period), which he intended to bring out in a black cover with
the title in blood-red letters; they stole the clerk’s cap off his
knee, and made him dance a Cossack dance by way of ransom for it;
they dressed up old Vonifaty in a woman’s cap, and the young
princess put on a man’s hat… . I could not enumerate all we did.
Only Byelovzorov kept more and more in the background, scowling and
angry… . Sometimes his eyes looked bloodshot, he flushed all over,
and it seemed every minute as though he would rush out upon us all
and scatter us like shavings in all directions; but the young
princess would glance at him, and shake her finger at him, and he
would retire into his corner again.</p>
<p>We were quite worn out at last. Even the old princess, though
she was ready for anything, as she expressed it, and no noise
wearied her, felt tired at last, and longed for peace and quiet. At
twelve o’clock at night, supper was served, consisting of a piece
of stale dry cheese, and some cold turnovers of minced ham, which
seemed to me more delicious than any pastry I had ever tasted;
there was only one bottle of wine, and that was a strange one; a
dark-coloured bottle with a wide neck, and the wine in it was of a
pink hue; no one drank it, however. Tired out and faint with
happiness, I left the lodge; at parting Zinaïda pressed my hand
warmly, and again smiled mysteriously.</p>
<p>The night air was heavy and damp in my heated face; a storm
seemed to be gathering; black stormclouds grew and crept across the
sky, their smoky outlines visibly changing. A gust of wind shivered
restlessly in the dark trees, and somewhere, far away on the
horizon, muffled thunder angrily muttered as it were to itself.</p>
<p>I made my way up to my room by the back stairs. My old man-nurse
was asleep on the floor, and I had to step over him; he waked up,
saw me, and told me that my mother had again been very angry with
me, and had wished to send after me again, but that my father had
prevented her. (I had never gone to bed without saying good-night
to my mother, and asking her blessing. There was no help for it
now!)</p>
<p>I told my man that I would undress and go to bed by myself, and
I put out the candle. But I did not undress, and did not go to
bed.</p>
<p>I sat down on a chair, and sat a long while, as though
spell-bound. What I was feeling was so new and so sweet… . I sat
still, hardly looking round and not moving, drew slow breaths, and
only from time to time laughed silently at some recollection, or
turned cold within at the thought that I was in love, that this was
she, that this was love. Zinaïda’s face floated slowly before me in
the darkness – floated, and did not float away; her lips still wore
the same enigmatic smile, her eyes watched me, a little from one
side, with a questioning, dreamy, tender look&#160;… as at the
instant of parting from her. At last I got up, walked on tiptoe to
my bed, and without undressing, laid my head carefully on the
pillow, as though I were afraid by an abrupt movement to disturb
what filled my soul… . I lay down, but did not even close my eyes.
Soon I noticed that faint glimmers of light of some sort were
thrown continually into the room… . I sat up and looked at the
window. The window-frame could be clearly distinguished from the
mysteriously and dimly-lighted panes. It is a storm, I thought; and
a storm it really was, but it was raging so very far away that the
thunder could not be heard; only blurred, long, as it were
branching, gleams of lightning flashed continually over the sky; it
was not flashing, though, so much as quivering and twitching like
the wing of a dying bird. I got up, went to the window, and stood
there till morning… . The lightning never ceased for an instant; it
was what is called among the peasants a <em>sparrow night</em>. I
gazed at the dumb sandy plain, at the dark mass of the Neskutchny
gardens, at the yellowish façades of the distant buildings, which
seemed to quiver too at each faint flash… . I gazed, and could not
turn away; these silent lightning flashes, these gleams seemed in
response to the secret silent fires which were aglow within me.
Morning began to dawn; the sky was flushed in patches of crimson.
As the sun came nearer, the lightning grew gradually paler, and
ceased; the quivering gleams were fewer and fewer, and vanished at
last, drowned in the sobering positive light of the coming day…
.</p>
<p>And my lightning flashes vanished too. I felt great weariness
and peace&#160;… but Zinaïda’s image still floated triumphant over
my soul. But it too, this image, seemed more tranquil: like a swan
rising out of the reeds of a bog, it stood out from the other
unbeautiful figures surrounding it, and as I fell asleep, I flung
myself before it in farewell, trusting adoration… .</p>
<p>Oh, sweet emotions, gentle harmony, goodness and peace of the
softened heart, melting bliss of the first raptures of love, where
are they, where are they?</p>
