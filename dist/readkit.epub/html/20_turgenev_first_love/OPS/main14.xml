<p>The next day I got up early, cut myself a stick, and set off
beyond the town-gates. I thought I would walk off my sorrow. It was
a lovely day, bright and not too hot, a fresh sportive breeze roved
over the earth with temperate rustle and frolic, setting all things
a-flutter and harassing nothing. I wandered a long while over hills
and through woods; I had not felt happy, I had left home with the
intention of giving myself up to melancholy, but youth, the
exquisite weather, the fresh air, the pleasure of rapid motion, the
sweetness of repose, lying on the thick grass in a solitary nook,
gained the upper hand; the memory of those never-to-be-forgotten
words, those kisses, forced itself once more upon my soul. It was
sweet to me to think that Zinaïda could not, anyway, fail to do
justice to my courage, my heroism… .’ Others may seem better to her
than I,’ I mused, ‘let them! But others only say what they would
do, while I have done it. And what more would I not do for her?’ My
fancy set to work. I began picturing to myself how I would save her
from the hands of enemies; how, covered with blood I would tear her
by force from prison, and expire at her feet. I remembered a
picture hanging in our drawing-room – Malek-Adel bearing away
Matilda – but at that point my attention was absorbed by the
appearance of a speckled woodpecker who climbed busily up the
slender stem of a birch-tree and peeped out uneasily from behind
it, first to the right, then to the left, like a musician behind
the bass-viol.</p>
<p>Then I sang ‘Not the white snows’, and passed from that to a
song well known at that period: ‘I await thee, when the wanton
zephyr’, then I began reading aloud Yermak’s address to the stars
from Homyakov’s tragedy. I made an attempt to compose something
myself in a sentimental vein, and invented the line which was to
conclude each verse: ‘O Zinaïda, Zinaïda!’ but could get no further
with it. Meanwhile it was getting on towards dinner-time. I went
down into the valley; a narrow sandy path winding through it led to
the town. I walked along this path… . The dull thud of horses’
hoofs resounded behind me. I looked round instinctively, stood
still and took off my cap. I saw my father and Zinaïda. They were
riding side by side. My father was saying something to her, bending
right over to her, his hand propped on the horses’ neck, he was
smiling. Zinaïda listened to him in silence, her eyes severely cast
down, and her lips tightly pressed together. At first I saw them
only; but a few instants later, Byelovzorov came into sight round a
bend in the glade, he was wearing a hussar’s uniform with a
pelisse, and riding a foaming black horse. The gallant horse tossed
its head, snorted and pranced from side to side, his rider was at
once holding him in and spurring him on. I stood aside. My father
gathered up the reins, moved away from Zinaïda, she slowly raised
her eyes to him, and both galloped off&#160;… Byelovzorov flew
after them, his sabre clattering behind him. ‘He’s as red as a
crab,’ I reflected, ‘while she&#160;… why’s she so pale? out riding
the whole morning, and pale?’</p>
<p>I redoubled my pace, and got home just at dinner-time. My father
was already sitting by my mother’s chair, dressed for dinner,
washed and fresh; he was reading an article from the <em>Journal
des Débats</em> in his smooth musical voice; but my mother heard
him without attention, and when she saw me, asked where I had been
to all day long, and added that she didn’t like this gadding about
God knows where, and God knows in what company. ‘But I have been
walking alone,’ I was on the point of replying, but I looked at my
father, and for some reason or other held my peace.</p>
