<p>‘How can I make their acquaintance?’ was my first thought when I
waked in the morning. I went out in the garden before morning tea,
but I did not go too near the fence, and saw no one. After drinking
tea, I walked several times up and down the street before the
house, and looked into the windows from a distance… . I fancied her
face at a curtain, and I hurried away in alarm.</p>
<p>‘I must make her acquaintance, though,’ I thought, pacing
distractedly about the sandy plain that stretches before Neskutchny
park&#160;… ‘but how, that is the question.’ I recalled the
minutest details of our meeting yesterday; I had for some reason or
other a particularly vivid recollection of how she had laughed at
me… . But while I racked my brains, and made various plans, fate
had already provided for me.</p>
<p>In my absence my mother had received from her new neighbour a
letter on grey paper, sealed with brown wax, such as is only used
in notices from the post-office or on the corks of bottles of cheap
wine. In this letter, which was written in illiterate language and
in a slovenly hand, the princess begged my mother to use her
powerful influence in her behalf; my mother, in the words of the
princess, was very intimate with persons of high position, upon
whom her fortunes and her children’s fortunes depended, as she had
some very important business in hand. ‘I address myself to you,’
she wrote, ‘as one gentlewoman to another gentlewoman, and for that
reason am glad to avail myself of the opportunity.’ Concluding, she
begged my mother’s permission to call upon her. I found my mother
in an unpleasant state of indecision; my father was not at home,
and she had no one of whom to ask advice. Not to answer a
gentlewoman, and a princess into the bargain, was impossible. But
my mother was in a difficulty as to how to answer her. To write a
note in French struck her as unsuitable, and Russian spelling was
not a strong point with my mother herself, and she was aware of it,
and did not care to expose herself. She was overjoyed when I made
my appearance, and at once told me to go round to the princess’s,
and to explain to her by word of mouth that my mother would always
be glad to do her excellency any service within her powers, and
begged her to come to see her at one o’clock. This unexpectedly
rapid fulfilment of my secret desires both delighted and appalled
me. I made no sign, however, of the perturbation which came over
me, and as a preliminary step went to my own room to put on a new
necktie and tail coat; at home I still wore short jackets and
lay-down collars, much as I abominated them.</p>
