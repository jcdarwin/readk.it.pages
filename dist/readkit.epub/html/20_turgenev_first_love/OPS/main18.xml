<p>I got up in the morning with a headache. My emotion of the
previous day had vanished. It was replaced by a dreary sense of
blankness and a sort of sadness I had not known till then, as
though something had died in me.</p>
<p>‘Why is it you’re looking like a rabbit with half its brain
removed?’ said Lushin on meeting me. At lunch I stole a look first
at my father, then at my mother: he was composed, as usual; she
was, as usual, secretly irritated. I waited to see whether my
father would make some friendly remarks to me, as he sometimes did…
. But he did not even bestow his everyday cold greeting upon me.
‘Shall I tell Zinaïda all?’ I wondered… . ‘It’s all the same,
anyway; all is at an end between us.’ I went to see her, but told
her nothing, and, indeed, I could not even have managed to get a
talk with her if I had wanted to. The old princess’s son, a cadet
of twelve years old, had come from Petersburg for his holidays;
Zinaïda at once handed her brother over to me. ‘Here,’ she said,’
my dear Volodya,’ – it was the first time she had used this
pet-name to me – ‘is a companion for you. His name is Volodya, too.
Please, like him; he is still shy, but he has a good heart. Show
him Neskutchny gardens, go walks with him, take him under your
protection. You’ll do that, won’t you? you’re so good, too!’ She
laid both her hands affectionately on my shoulders, and I was
utterly bewildered. The presence of this boy transformed me, too,
into a boy. I looked in silence at the cadet, who stared as
silently at me. Zinaïda laughed, and pushed us towards each other.
‘Embrace each other, children!’ We embraced each other. ‘Would you
like me to show you the garden?’ I inquired of the cadet. ‘If you
please,’ he replied, in the regular cadet’s hoarse voice. Zinaïda
laughed again… . I had time to notice that she had never had such
an exquisite colour in her face before. I set off with the cadet.
There was an old-fashioned swing in our garden. I sat him down on
the narrow plank seat, and began swinging him. He sat rigid in his
new little uniform of stout cloth, with its broad gold braiding,
and kept tight hold of the cords. ‘You’d better unbutton your
collar,’ I said to him. ‘It’s all right; we’re used to it,’ he
said, and cleared his throat. He was like his sister. The eyes
especially recalled her, I liked being nice to him; and at the same
time an aching sadness was gnawing at my heart. ‘Now I certainly am
a child,’ I thought; ‘but yesterday… .’ I remembered where I had
dropped my knife the night before, and looked for it. The cadet
asked me for it, picked a thick stalk of wild parsley, cut a pipe
out of it, and began whistling. Othello whistled too.</p>
<p>But in the evening how he wept, this Othello, in Zinaïda’s arms,
when, seeking him out in a corner of the garden, she asked him why
he was so depressed. My tears flowed with such violence that she
was frightened. ‘What is wrong with you? What is it, Volodya?’ she
repeated; and seeing I made no answer, and did not cease weeping,
she was about to kiss my wet cheek. But I turned away from her, and
whispered through my sobs, ‘I know all. Why did you play with me?…
What need had you of my love?’</p>
<p>‘I am to blame, Volodya&#160;… ’ said Zinaïda. ‘I am very much
to blame&#160;… ’ she added, wringing her hands. ‘How much there is
bad and black and sinful in me!… But I am not playing with you now.
I love you; you don’t even suspect why and how… . But what is it
you know?’</p>
<p>What could I say to her? She stood facing me, and looked at me;
and I belonged to her altogether from head to foot directly she
looked at me… . A quarter of an hour later I was running races with
the cadet and Zinaïda. I was not crying, I was laughing, though my
swollen eyelids dropped a tear or two as I laughed. I had Zinaïda’s
ribbon round my neck for a cravat, and I shouted with delight
whenever I succeeded in catching her round the waist. She did just
as she liked with me.</p>
