<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/83.epub"><em>War and
Peace</em></a>
<p>War and Peace is a novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published from
1865 to 1869 in Russkii Vestnik, which tells the story of Russian
society during the Napoleonic Era. It is usually described as one
of Tolstoy's two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina)
as well as one of the world's greatest novels.<br />
War and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many
characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the
grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally
large topics of youth, marriage, age, and death. Though it is often
called a novel today, it broke so many conventions of the form that
it was not considered a novel in its time. Indeed, Tolstoy himself
considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel
in the European sense.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/22.epub"><em>Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland</em></a>
<p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) is a novel written by
English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known under the
pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice
who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy world populated by
peculiar and anthropomorphic creatures.<br />
The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends (and
enemies), and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were
expected to memorize. The tale plays with logic in ways that have
made the story of lasting popularity with adults as well as
children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic
examples of the genre of literary nonsense, and its narrative
course and structure has been enormously influential, mainly in the
fantasy genre.</p>

Count of Monte Cristo</em></a>
<p>The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is
an adventure novel by Alexandre Dumas, père. It is often
considered, along with The Three Musketeers, as Dumas' most popular
work. It is also among the highest selling books of all time. The
writing of the work was completed in 1844. Like many of his novels,
it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his
collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.<br />
The story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the
Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of
1815–1838 (from just before the Hundred Days through the reign of
Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental
element of the book. It is primarily concerned with themes of hope,
justice, vengeance, mercy, forgiveness and death, and is told in
the style of an adventure story.</p>

<p>Dracula is an 1897 novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, featuring
as its primary antagonist the vampire Count Dracula.<br />
Dracula has been attributed to many literary genres including
vampire literature, horror fiction, the gothic novel and invasion
literature. Structurally it is an epistolary novel, that is, told
as a series of diary entries and letters. Literary critics have
examined many themes in the novel, such as the role of women in
Victorian culture, conventional and conservative sexuality,
immigration, colonialism, postcolonialism and folklore. Although
Stoker did not invent the vampire, the novel's influence on the
popularity of vampires has been singularly responsible for many
theatrical and film interpretations throughout the 20th and 21st
centuries.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/3431.epub"><em>The
Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em></a>
<p>This story was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain's to the
effect that it was a pity that the best part of life came at the
beginning and the worst part at the end. By trying the experiment
upon only one man in a perfectly normal world I have scarcely given
his idea a fair trial. Several weeks after completing it, I
discovered an almost identical plot in Samuel Butler's
"Note-books."<br />
The story was published in "Collier's" last summer and provoked
this startling letter from an anonymous admirer in
Cincinnati:<br />
"Sir--<br />
I have read the story Benjamin Button in Colliers and I wish to say
that as a short story writer you would make a good lunatic I have
seen many peices of cheese in my life but of all the peices of
cheese I have ever seen you are the biggest peice. I hate to waste
a peice of stationary on you but I will."</p>
