Nightingale and the Rose</em></a>
<p>A nightingale overhears a student complaining that his
professor's daughter will not dance with him, as he is unable to
give her a red rose. The nightingale visits all the rose-trees in
the garden, and one of the white roses tell her that there's a way
to produce a red rose, but only if the nightingale is prepared to
sing the sweetest song for the rose all night, and sacrifice her
life to do so. Seeing the student in tears, the nightingale carries
out the ritual, and impales herself on the rose-tree's thorn so
that her heart's blood can stain the rose. The student takes the
rose to the professor's daughter, but she again rejects him because
another man has sent her some real jewels, and "everybody knows
that jewels cost far more than flowers." The student angrily throws
the rose into the gutter, returns to his study of metaphysics, and
decides not to believe in true love anymore.</p>

Canterville Ghost</em></a>
<p>The Canterville Ghost is a popular 1887 novella by Oscar Wilde,
widely adapted for the screen and stage.<br />
“The Canterville Ghost” is a parody featuring a dramatic spirit
named Sir Simon and the United States minister (ambassador) to the
Court of St. James's, Hiram B. Otis. Mr. Otis travels to England
with his family and moves into a haunted country house. Lord
Canterville, the previous owner of the house, warns Mr. Otis that
the ghost of Sir Simon de Canterville has haunted it ever since he
killed his wife, Eleonore, three centuries before. But Mr. Otis
dismisses the ghost story as bunk and disregards Lord Canterville’s
warnings. When the Otises learn that the house is indeed haunted,
they succeed in victimizing the ghost and in disregarding age-old
British traditions. What emerges is a satire of American
materialism, a lampoon of traditional British values, and an
amusing twist on the traditional gothic horror tale.</p>

Importance of Being Earnest</em></a>
<p>Set in England during the late Victorian era, the play's humour
derives in part from characters maintaining fictitious identities
to escape unwelcome social obligations. It is replete with witty
dialogue and satirizes some of the foibles and hypocrisy of late
Victorian society. It has proved Wilde's most enduringly popular
play.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/6.epub"><em>The
Picture of Dorian Gray</em></a>
<p>Oscar Wilde's story of a fashionable young man who sells his
soul for eternal youth and beauty is one of his most popular works.
Written in Wilde's characteristically dazzling manner, full of
stinging epigrams and shrewd observations, the tale of Dorian
Gray's moral disintegration caused something of a scandal when it
first appeared in 1890. Wilde was attacked for his decadence and
corrupting influence, and a few years later the book and the
aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials
occasioned by Wilde's homosexual liaisons, trials that resulted in
his imprisonment. Of the book's value as autobiography, Wilde noted
in a letter, "Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what
the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be--in other ages,
perhaps."</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/22.epub"><em>Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland</em></a>
<p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) is a novel written by
English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known under the
pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice
who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy world populated by
peculiar and anthropomorphic creatures.<br />
The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends (and
enemies), and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were
expected to memorize. The tale plays with logic in ways that have
made the story of lasting popularity with adults as well as
children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic
examples of the genre of literary nonsense, and its narrative
course and structure has been enormously influential, mainly in the
fantasy genre.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/4675.epub"><em>The
Life, Adventures &amp; Piracies of the Famous Captain
Singleton</em></a>
<p>The narrative describes the life of an Englishman, stolen from a
well-to-do family as a child and raised by Gypsies who eventually
makes his way to sea. One half of the book concerns Singleton's
crossing of Africa and the later half concerns his life as a
pirate. Defoe's description of piracy focuses for the most part on
matters of economics and logistics, making it an intriguing if not
particularly gripping read. Singleton's piracy is more like a
merchant adventurer, perhaps Defoe's comment on capitalism.</p>

Trumpet-Major</em></a>
<p>Hardy distrusted the application of nineteenth-century
empiricism to history because he felt it marginalized important
human elements. In The Trumpet Major, the tale of a woman courted
by three competing suitors during the Napoleonic wars, he explores
the subversive effects of ordinary human desire and conflicting
loyalties on systematized versions of history.</p>

<p>Elfride finds herself caught in a battle between her heart, her
mind and the expectations of her parents and society. The novel is
notable for the strong parallels to Hardy and his first wife Emma
Gifford. When Elfride's father finds that his guest and candidate
for his daughter's hand, architect's assistant Stephen Smith, is
the son of a mason, he immediately orders him to leave. This was
the third of Hardy's novels to be published and the first to bear
his name.</p>
