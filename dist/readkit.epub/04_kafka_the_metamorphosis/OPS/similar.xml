Brothers Karamazov</em></a>
<p>The Brothers Karamazov is the final novel by the Russian author
Fyodor Dostoevsky, and is generally considered the culmination of
his life's work. Dostoevsky spent nearly two years writing The
Brothers Karamazov, which was published as a serial in The Russian
Messenger and completed in November 1880. Dostoevsky intended it to
be the first part in an epic story titled The Life of a Great
Sinner, but he died less than four months after its
publication.<br />
The book portrays a parricide in which each of the murdered man's
sons share a varying degree of complicity. On a deeper level, it is
a spiritual drama of moral struggles concerning faith, doubt,
reason, free will and modern Russia. Dostoevsky composed much of
the novel in Staraya Russa, which is also the main setting of the
novel.</p>

Picture of Dorian Gray</em></a>
<p>Oscar Wilde's story of a fashionable young man who sells his
soul for eternal youth and beauty is one of his most popular works.
Written in Wilde's characteristically dazzling manner, full of
stinging epigrams and shrewd observations, the tale of Dorian
Gray's moral disintegration caused something of a scandal when it
first appeared in 1890. Wilde was attacked for his decadence and
corrupting influence, and a few years later the book and the
aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials
occasioned by Wilde's homosexual liaisons, trials that resulted in
his imprisonment. Of the book's value as autobiography, Wilde noted
in a letter, "Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what
the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be--in other ages,
perhaps."</p>

Good and Evil</em></a>
<p>Beyond Good and Evil (German: Jenseits von Gut und Böse),
subtitled "Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future" (Vorspiel einer
Philosophie der Zukunft), is a book by the German philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1886.<br />
It takes up and expands on the ideas of his previous work, Thus
Spoke Zarathustra, but approached from a more critical, polemical
direction.<br />
In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche attacks past philosophers for
their alleged lack of critical sense and their blind acceptance of
Christian premises in their consideration of morality. The work
moves into the realm "beyond good and evil" in the sense of leaving
behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a
destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative
approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of
knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.</p>

<p>Ulysses is a novel by James Joyce, first serialized in parts in
the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December
1920, then published in its entirety by Sylvia Beach on February 2,
1922, in Paris. It is considered one of the most important works of
Modernist literature.<br />
Ulysses chronicles the passage through Dublin by its main
character, Leopold Bloom, during an ordinary day, June 16, 1904.
The title alludes to the hero of Homer's Odyssey (Latinised into
Ulysses), and there are many parallels, both implicit and explicit,
between the two works (e.g., the correspondences between Leopold
Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus
and Telemachus).</p>

Tell-Tale Heart</em></a>
<p>"The Tell-Tale Heart" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe first
published in 1843. It follows an unnamed narrator who insists on
his sanity after murdering an old man with a "vulture eye". The
murder is carefully calculated, and the murderer hides the body by
cutting it into pieces and hiding it under the floorboards.
Ultimately the narrator's guilt manifests itself in the
hallucination that the man's heart is still beating under the
floorboards.<br />
It is unclear what relationship, if any, the old man and his
murderer share. It has been suggested that the old man is a father
figure or, perhaps, that his vulture eye represents some sort of
veiled secret. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main
characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details
leading up to the murder.<br />
The story was first published in James Russell Lowell's The Pioneer
in January 1843. "The Tell-Tale Heart" is widely considered a
classic of the Gothic fiction genre and one of Poe's most famous
short stories.</p>

Prince</em></a>
<p>Il Principe (The Prince) is a political treatise by the
Florentine public servant and political theorist Niccolò
Machiavelli. Originally called De Principatibus (About
Principalities), it was written in 1513, but not published until
1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. The treatise is not
representative of the work published during his lifetime, but it is
the most remembered, and the work responsible for bringing
"Machiavellian" into wide usage as a pejorative term. It has also
been suggested by some critics that the piece is, in fact, a
satire.</p>

<p>The Trial (German: Der Process) is a novel by Franz Kafka about
a character named Josef K., who awakens one morning and, for
reasons never revealed, is arrested and prosecuted for an
unspecified crime.<br />
According to Kafka's friend Max Brod, the author never finished the
novel and wrote in his will that it was to be destroyed. After his
death, Brod went against Kafka's wishes and edited The Trial into
what he felt was a coherent novel and had it published in 1925.</p>

of Cthulhu</em></a>
<p>"The Call of Cthulhu" is one of H. P. Lovecraft's best-known
short stories. Written in the summer of 1926, it was first
published in Weird Tales, February 1928. It is the only story
written by Lovecraft in which the extraterrestrial entity Cthulhu
himself makes a major appearance.<br />
It is written in a documentary style, with three independent
narratives linked together by the device of a narrator discovering
notes left by a deceased relative. The narrator pieces together the
whole truth and disturbing significance of the information he
possesses, illustrating the story's first line: "The most merciful
thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to
correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance
in the midst of black seas of infinity; and it was not meant that
we should voyage far."</p>
