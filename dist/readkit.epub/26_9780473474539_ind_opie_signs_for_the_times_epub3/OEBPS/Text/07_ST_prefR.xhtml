<h3 class="sec1a"><b>Preface</b></h3>
<p class="noindent1">In the tsunami of destruction (often mistermed creative destruction) unleashed on the world in the past 30 years, the failed attempt between 1993 and 2008 to found an independent national humanities organisation in Aotearoa New Zealand stands as a symptom of what continues to be at stake. By advancing technocratic over moral knowledge, modern Western governments have turned the pursuit of knowledge and innovation for human betterment to the service of private profit and wealth creation as ends in themselves. The radical and chaotic social force of the market, to be regulated only when the interests of those in power are threatened by too much risk, has been substituted for the much more complex processes of thoughtful and collectively overseen social and cultural evolution. The opacity of its highly technical operation, the financial benefits conferred on its expert operatives, and the risk of social revolution which attends upon its gross inequalities, together mark a startling hollowing out of the meaning and purpose of democracy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In part, the problematic of this book was set out centuries ago by Sir Thomas More and John Milton. In <i>Utopia</i> More foregrounded the problem facing renaissance humanists of how to give advice to those in power in the nascent nation states of Europe. The world traveller and philosopher, Raphael Hythloday, who brings to actual London news of the ideal city of Utopia, asserts that giving advice based on knowledge of the object as such rather than on knowledge of the recipient of the advice is a waste of time. In the process he indicates the quite different ways in which knowledge is used, in the mental, fictional and conceptual spaces of thought as such, and in the time-bound settings in which knowledge is blended with politics, wealth and power. It is difficult to imagine where in human history knowledge as such could have been completely freed from politics, wealth and power, not even (or especially not) in universities; nonetheless, the burden Hytholday recognised of finding the ways and means to communicate knowledge which is true in itself effectively to publics and governments still rests on those who make claims to possess such knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have used as epigraphs to the book’s chapters quotations from Milton’s anti-censorship text, <i>Areopagitica,</i> a decision made in 2008 during the celebration of the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Milton’s birth. While this text can be counted as one among many of his prose writings to engage in humanist politics, it is <i>Paradise Lost</i> which presents modern readers with the most extraordinary envisaging of the exercise of powers – intellectual, scientific, technological, political, historical, economic, social, affectional and environmental – which constitute the modern world and its subjects, and most especially Western techno-scientific, capitalist and democratic nations. Milton remarkably anticipated the postmodern condition when he depicted the twin zones of the order containing our world as marked by the love for humanity (Heaven) and the hatred of humanity (Hell). The supreme individual, Satan, sought absolute power: through the power of the creative application of intelligence and techno-scientific knowledge, he sought to make the universe into his model of it; and, under the guise of a commitment to the freedom of the angels and humanity from divine tyranny through the invention of democracy, to make himself the sovereign power. The vivid worlds brought to imagined and moral life in a reader’s engagement with the poem can speak now more fully to us about the actuality of the modern world because the past as future which it contemplates has come to pass; for example, in their manner of exploiting the Earth’s resources, humanity learned from the fallen angels when they “with impious hands/Rifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth/For Treasures better hid” (1.686-88), a mode of action now known as creating economic growth or the resource curse. The poem foregrounds the moral complexities of every human choice and action, a powerful contrast to bureaucratic language which converts the often awful actuality of people’s lives into calm abstractions like collateral damage or the housing market or reducing rates of crime or expenditure on health or traumatised children or the aging population. Referencing <i>Utopia</i> and <i>Paradise Lost</i> here introduces what will be a regular practice in this study; examples from fiction will be used as having evidential standing for analysis and argument concerning the governance and futures of any society and culture.</p>
<h3 class="sec1a"><i><b>A matter of terminology</b></i></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The term <i>humanities</i> has little or no purchase on decision-making by governments and the major institutions which provide form and continuity to democratic societies and individual lives. But there is no better term in English for the kinds of knowledge to which it traditionally refers. In this study, the term is used to refer to</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>a disciplined and professional mode of intellectual practice based on the analysis and interpretation of textual objects, typically associated with university-level or advanced research and inquiry, and</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the global corpus of this knowledge in all the media forms and languages in which it is expressed and recorded.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In these ways the term humanities has a universal application, however much its outcomes are inflected by local contexts. The knowledge work of the humanities has multiple audiences, and its professional workers must acquire the rhetorics appropriate to communicating with those audiences. It is constituted in interaction with the media forms available for representation and communication of thought in a particular society. In the case of globalised, digitally networked societies, this interaction is producing a new multi-mediated humanities. Its domain is public; its scope is inclusive of all forms of knowledge; its setting is the city; its locus of application/productivity is the emancipated citizen.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is therefore important to distinguish between the knowledge created by this high-level, institutionalised mode of intellectual work and what becomes of it when it is disseminated through the multiplicity of media channels available in postmodern societies and re-formed by its active and insightful application to local and immediate situations and events. I understand this highly distributed and constantly re-forming version of the humanities as <i>humanistic knowledge</i>. It is value-laden knowledge produced by singular minds in negotiation with others in all social contexts with the aim of informing decision and action; it is grounded in the always elaborating contents of cultural knowledge and, even while seeking truths, actually providing always provisional answers to the question, What does it mean to be human?</p>
<p class="noindent1">But there is also a third kind, which in this study is called <i>humanities-aronui,</i> or Aotearoa New Zealand humanities. What this term means is discussed in some detail in <a href="09_ST_CHR1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter One</a>; it suffices to say here that while the advanced pursuit of enquiry in the humanities is always inflected by the cultures and histories of the place where it is carried on, there is also a domain within the global humanities which has a specifically local/national focus and purpose. In the instance of the writing of this book the place is Aotearoa New Zealand. The double name came into usage late in the twentieth century when the political and bureaucratic agencies of the state, and many civil society organisations, were attempting to respond to the bicultural and bilingual challenge of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi to achieve a postcolonial settlement between the two principal cultures and languages in the territory of New Zealand. It remains relevant because it signals that the issue of linguistic and cultural diversity in the composition of a postmodern nation has become more rather than less important internationally. I will typically use New Zealand to refer to the land mass and its peoples, but will use Aotearoa New Zealand at points in the discussion when it is important to be reminded that the nation of New Zealand is officially bicultural and bilingual (Māori and English), while being actually and increasingly multicultural and multilingual.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Those who participate in the creation, dissemination and reproduction of this mode of knowledge, academic and public, are <i>humanists</i>. Even though, in the British tradition, the term humanist refers to a member of the Humanist Society and a rational, secular conception of the world, the term is used here as it is in the United States to refer to a person with professional training and interests in the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In any account of the creation of knowledge in the modern humanities, the interaction between a print text and a reader is normative, and also critical to the conception of invention in the humanities. But the textual objects available for study now exist in multiple media forms, each of which has a different term for the person interacting with the medium (reader, spectator, viewer, auditor/hearer, user, player), as it does for the origin of the text (author, poet, dramatist, choreographer, composer, film-maker, historian, philosopher, musician, actor, director, designer, architect, scientist, writer, and so on). I was tempted to use the term beholder as the most general term for the former group, but it has too strong a connotation of passive observation; so I will use the term <i>reader</i> not because of its print association but because of the connotation of interpreting as an active and constant aspect of engagement with any text in any medium. As for the originator(s) of a text, I will use <i>writer</i> unless the context requires a more specific term.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There is also the question of what term to use for what is variously referred to as nature, the material world, the physical world, or the given world. I will tend to use <i>the given world,</i> meaning everything that exists, including our evolution as a species on Earth, and which will continue to exist whether humanity does or not. It also provides the most direct contrast with the worlds which humans (according to human conceptions and desires) have designed and made, and are continuing with increasing power to design and make, by appropriating the matter and energies of the given world to their uses. Within this inclusive term there is a strong binary which haunts our inhabitiation of the planet, namely, humanity and its other, the non-human.</p>
<h3 class="sec1a"><i><b>The problem of the (missing) humanities</b></i></h3>
<p class="noindent1">In one respect, this book is about the profound exclusion of the modern humanities as the body of traditional Western knowledge from the thought of those most responsible for the management of knowledge work, the generating of new knowledge and the application of knowledge to the problems resulting from the headlong rush to exploit the resources of the planet, natural and human, for financial gain.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It seeks to establish the parameters within which the humanities as a body of knowledge and a distinctive practice in knowledge creation (a humanities to-come) can claim a new place in the complex system of knowledge evolving in twenty-first century postmodern Western democracies. These societies are marked not just by the extraordinary power over the given world accomplished by science and its technological expressions, but by the power of electronic networks in the transmission and manipulation of signs (specifically signs for knowledge and money). In another register they are also marked by the dispersion of cultural nations, their distinctive languages, inherited knowledges, beliefs, and values across the territorial boundaries by which nations were defined in the twentieth century, both physically and in cyberspace.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is a daunting prospect, facing a panoramic scene constituted by the current systems of world knowledge and trying to locate the proper place of the “humanities-to-come” among those systems; but that place must be found if the current subordination of the humanities to techno-scientific knowledge is to be redressed. From one perspective, the humanities are simply invisible, since for the majority of knowledge workers the domain defined by the term science occupies the whole knowledge space when the term social is added to it. A desire to try to reassert the “original” meaning of science as methodically produced knowledge and to rename the humanities as the human sciences evades the core issue, which is that the methods and objects of science are integral to one another, are constitutive of the modern scientific project, and are incompatible with the methods and objects of the humanities. Nature is not a text, except figuratively (that is, humanly); and humanity is not only nature. Scientific method reduces language to denotation in the search for the universal; method in the humanities amplifies language and semiosis in the search for the meaning of the plural idea of humanity to-come.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Yuri Lotman (2009 140), whose thought plays a major role in this book, wrote that</p>
<p class="quote">A differentiated science focuses on research and on actualizing as yet unknown truths or untruths for the sake of structuring a realm of possible propositions by means of the true/untrue code and on the basis of decision programs (theories, methods) related to this code. At the same time, science treats currently improbable or rejected perspectives as a reservoir for findings that may turn out to be tenable after all.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As a succinct entry into the acount of the humanities I am offering here, I would propose the following rephrasing:</p>
<p class="quote">A differentiated humanities focuses on textual research and on realizing as yet unknown or forgotten truths, meanings and values by structuring a realm of possible propositions by means of the human/non-human code and on the basis of decision programs (theories, methods) appropriate to interpreting materials composed in relation to this code. At the same time, the humanities treats currently improbable or rejected perspectives as clues to the discovery of obscured or suppressed truths, meanings and values in past and current cultural settlements.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Human complexity requires the development of conceptually complex discourses able to make this complexity available to thought and to permit theorisation based on culturally created evidence. At every point of discrimination, the inherited patterns of thought based on the human/non-human code are challenged, for example, through the study of animal intelligence or the development of autonomous machines. As with the sciences, the findings of humanistic inquiry can be translated into discursive forms enabling the conversation of society to be enriched by <i>conceptions</i> of the given world and humanity which make the human position in the universe more comprehensible and therefore more available to productive adaptation, especially now when faced with conditions which are the result of collective human action. With such knowledge also comes moral responsibility for the effects of human decision-making.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is not sufficient to attempt to reassert the modern humanities within the current system in which the techno-sciences exercise hegemonic dominance, and to claim a value for the modern humanities as knowledge that really counts which can overcome their present greying out. The gross imbalance in the politics of knowledge and its derivation from the mirror relation linking the state and the globalising corporation means that what has been marginalised cannot be recovered. This work (which is intellectual and political) cannot be accomplished from within the modern academic humanities, because (however brilliant their practitioners, and however much their work graces the claims of the western university to represent the whole of knowledge), they exist more under the patronage of those with actual discursive power (scientists, technologists and managers) than demonstrate an ability to shape the frameworks of knowledge policy and practice either in universities or in the governmental and corporate worlds to which the university has become (but perhaps has always been) subservient. Reframing the disciplinary apparatus of the western university could lead this rebalancing, but among other conditions that would require a fundamental shift in the professional model of the academic, especially in the humanities. Hence what is required is advocacy for a new humanities, the signs of the becoming of which are especially evident in organisations seeking to represent the postmodern humanities in national jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have tried to identify accounts of key issues which precede the discourses dominating the past three decades, and which exemplify the role of objectified knowledge and the collective memory in shaping analysis of our present. Immersion in the dynamism of politics and government in the immediate moment makes it difficult to perceive that new thinking and policy is so often the old cut in another way by generational change among policy makers catching up with the present, and by shifts in discourse and social power and the politics which bring them to the public surface. Contrarily, those seeking to shift power in their direction often find the figure of the child’s innocent openness to the world, with nothing to forget, compelling as a model of the mind disposed to accept the new without resistance.</p>
<h3 class="sec1a"><i><b>In the local and among singulars</b></i></h3>
<p class="noindent1">This study of the humanities is grounded in a local history. It orients itself to the large world of empires, powerful nations and global forces from a geopolitical position in the South Pacific and one of the smaller nations, Aotearoa New Zealand. It names some people whose lives intersected at a specific point in time and space, who shared enough - in beliefs, politics, intellectual formation and curiosity, and the will to effect considered and considerate change in a society and nation to which they belonged - to be able to work together in a collaborative enterprise structured and energised by an idea.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This book aims to exemplify the character of the humanities: it exists as written language; its sources are a selection from among the extraordinary multiplicity of texts circulating in the world of texts (the semiosphere) which are marked by their time and place of composition and are not in themselves definitive or conclusive in the domains of knowledge and discourse out of which they have come; these sources are both translated (literally into English where their first language is not English, and into the situated version of English which is my language of origin in New Zealand) and interpreted through the screen of my own knowledge and experience; its effects are effects in thought which only become effects in social reality when thought is translated by any reader into decisions to think and act in specific ways conditioned by another context than that in which this book has been written. If the argument of the book can lay claim to innovation, it is not innovation measurable in the ways in which Western governments now measure innovation, by calculation of economic value.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have referenced texts which have in one way or another impressed me with their thoughtfulness and helped me to understand better what I needed to write. Each issue is embedded in extensive bibliographies and academic and institutional/professional specialisms and interests, and I make no pretence to have thoroughly explored any of them. When discussing policy issues to do with knowledge, innovation and culture I have usually referred to policy texts local to Aotearoa New Zealand (but which can include Australia). All fictions build the imagined worlds in which they involve their readers out of imagined localities. Those that find a place here do so because of what they encourage their readers to think, now, at the time of encounter, exemplifying the mode of intercultural dialogue in the context of overarching principles sought by the New Humanism which is discussed in <a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter Four</a>. What I hope to have done is to have captured a theme running through some of the thought about knowledge and human purposes in the complex conversation of modern and postmodern humanity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">While humanity is a global phenomenon, its manifestations are inherently local. Culture and language are universal human attributes, but cultural and linguistic diversity make universalist claims difficult. Societies may be categorised in terms of stages or socio-economic levels or political-class structures or ideologies; but what matters is the specific combination of these features which together constitute a particular society and its ability to meet the needs and interests of its citizens. Hence, while this book aims to raise issues which are of broader significance than to one nation state, Aotearoa New Zealand, a humanities’ perspective requires that the local should not be merged with the universal, but should retain its voice so that others hearing it (literally and figuratively), by hearing it differently may question the uses to which it is being put. Like the process of interpreting works of art in any medium, the process is one of building more general knowledge while preserving the uniqueness of the objects on which that knowledge is founded.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Unlike the conventions applying to much publication in the social sciences and humanities, I have used quotation rather than reference or paraphrase so as not to merge the textual voices of writers into a neutral, impartial voice. A text in the humanities stages a conversation between texts across time and space and its composition must be anchored in respect for the integrity and uniqueness of every text. There is an obvious and perhaps utopian politics in this conception of composing a text; not a procedure to force a specific society or text or human being into a universal mould, but always challenging the imposition of categories, however useful these are, as limits rather than as enablers in the further evolution of humanity grounded in its local variants.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a href="09_ST_CHR1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter One</a>: <i>Humanities in the Knowledge Society</i>, will take the process of attempting to establish a national organisation to represent the humanities in New Zealand as exemplary of the situation of the humanities in a technoscientific-dominated global knowledge order. It is both a narrative history and a commemoration of a process which, on my assessment, should have succeeded but actually failed. Others will regard the outcome as a success, however qualified, because the humanities in Aotearoa New Zealand, like the social sciences, found a place which was previously lacking in an existing national organisation representing knowledge. Whether or not this local history matters is itself a test of, the declining condition of the humanities as a part of the global human project of knowing the given world and ourselves.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a>: <i>Creating new knowledge: the way of the humanities</i> will develop an account of what is distinctive about the creation of knowledge in the humanities, how it contributes to innovation and value in postmodern societies, and why a new humanities is needed. It will focus on advanced knowledge, the university being the conventional and public institutional site of its creation.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter Three</a>: <i>The education state and the centrality of policy for arts, culture and heritage</i> argues that education and not the economy should be the primary focus of a democratic government, and that its underpinning policy should be cultural policy.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter Four</a>: <i>A new paradigm: cultural policy, the writing city, and the education state</i> works out the principal components of a social order in which a new humanities provides foundational knowledge in and to a state actively exploring/revealing/instantiating “democracy to-come” through its citizens and its institutions.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a>: <i>Locating the New through a New Humanities</i> explores the origin in the arts, and ultimately in the poem, of a new humanities. This chapter proposes that there is a track (complementary but also very different to that laid down by technoscience and business) leading to innovative thought opened up by the works of artists in all forms and media and given possible definitions in the knowledge derived from them by the interpretive work of a new humanities.</p>
<h3 class="sec1a"><i><b>Notes</b></i></h3>
<h4 class="sec2a">A note on authorial voice</h4>
<p class="noindent1">With respect to the narrative of <a href="09_ST_CHR1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter One</a>, I played an integral role in all aspects of the conceptualisation, development, and administration of the Humanities Society (HYMANZ) and the Council for the Humanities, the planning and presentation of projects, conferences and seminars, fund raising, and meetings with government officials and representatives of other national humanities organisations. I have tried to write about it as dispassionately and impersonally as possible.</p>
<h4 class="sec2a">A note on sources</h4>
<p class="noindent1">The records of HUMANZ and The Council for the Humanities are now held by the Alexander Turnbull Library. Most of the public events were audio recorded, and most recordings were transcribed with the aim of publication – but neither the energy or the funds were available to fulfil that intention. Key documents will be made available (again) on the web.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The names of those who sustained this work of institutional invention as members of the various Councils, those who became the first Fellows of the New Zealand Academy of the Humanities, and those who received the award of Pou Aronui, are listed in the Appendix.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I am grateful to Michael A. Peters for permission to present in revised form in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapters Two</a> and <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Three</a> material previously published as Opie (2013 and 2014b).</p>
