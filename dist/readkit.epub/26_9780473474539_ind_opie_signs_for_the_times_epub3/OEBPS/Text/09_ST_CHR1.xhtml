<p class="noindent1">“when your prudent spirit acknowledges and obeyes the voice of reason from what quarter soever it be heard speaking” (Milton 1974 199)</p>
<p class="noindent1">Although this discussion of the situation of the humanities in postmodern democratic societies, and specifically in Aotearoa New Zealand, will proceed as unemotively as possible, there remains so much justification for rational anger about how our societies are currently governed that, from time to time, it is necessary to be reminded that anger captures a truth that the disciplined “voice of reason” can miss. One such recent example is Manuel Castells’ research into and meditation on the social movements gathered together under the nominations of the Arab Spring and the Occupy Movement. He writes that</p>
<p class="quote">the roots [of social movements] are in the fundamental injustice of all societies […]. In each specific context, the usual horses of humanity’s apocalypses ride together under a variety of their hideous shapes: economic exploitation, hopeless poverty, unfair inequality, undemocratic polity, repressive states, unjust judiciary, racism, xenophobia, cultural negation, censorship, police brutality, warmongering, religious fanaticism (often against others’ religious beliefs), carelessness towards the blue planet (our only home), disregard of personal liberty, violation of privacy, gerontocracy, bigotry, sexism, homophobia and other atrocities in the long gallery of portraits featuring the monsters we are. And of course, always, in every instance and in every context, as the primary formation of a/n (unjust) social order, sheer domination by males over females and their children (Castells, 2012: 12).</p>
<p class="noindent1">This trenchant anatomising of the dark underside of human civilisation (and especially of the version promised by Western democracies), the qualities of human social living which undermine the claims to progress, enlightenment and human betterment by advances in knowledge and technology, draws on powerful traditions in Western thought which have been kept in the foreground by such apocalyptic texts as the Book of Revelations and are now the stuff of twenty-first century television news and drama, documentary and fictional film making, novels, and the social movements discussed by Castells. The key term, humanity, will not however signal that the bodies of knowledge most pertinent to the understanding of our monstrousness are to be found in the humanities. Instead, the current conventional response, especially in government, would be to regard the sciences and the social sciences as the sources of both the relevant knowledge and the means to address the diversity of the kinds of inhumanity characterising the postmodern global (dis)order.<sup><a id="note_1" href="#note1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Here can be found the starkest challenge to those making claims for the continuing importance of the ways of knowing characteristic of the humanities, the knowledge generated by human thought throughout human history and conserved by the humanities and the cultural institutions on which they depend, and the new knowledge created by contemporary interpretation of and reflection upon texts in all media and languages from all times and places. What does this knowledge make available for thought and enquiry which is not already provided (or will be in due course) by the sciences and social sciences? What knowledge work can and do the humanities perform in society which is as fundamental as that performed by the sciences?</p>
<p class="noindent1">If religion, law and the arts engage directly with the monstruous in human affairs, through theological analysis, the moral framing of social issues, and pastoral care grounded in communities, through legal analysis and the practice of the institutions of the legal system (professional bodies, courts, police and prisons), or through all kinds of aesthetic representations, what is left to the humanities as a fraction of the totality of academic knowledge? As a body of knowledge and intellectual practice the humanities persist as marginal to the dominant knowledges of the postmodern western university and lack (with the possible exception of historical societies) an institutional extension into society like that provided by churches, the legal profession and arts organisations. Very few would argue that, just as technoscience extends into society through all aspects of the economy and government, so do the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The purpose of the narrative, enquiry and analysis which follows is to ask three questions: “Why do/should the humanities continue to matter as a branch of fundamental human knowledge?”; “Why does it matter that the humanities should be able to speak directly and intelligibly to the governments of democratic societies?”; and, “What needs to happen in, to and for the humanities for those questions to find an answer?” Such questions point to the worldly contexts beyond the academic locations in which modern humanities continue to live, move and have their being. But they cannot be addressed without also acnowledging the typical dominance of the social sciences in academic, business and governmental representations of the kinds of knowledge most relevant to addressing questions about human societies. Apart from Castells’ cultural reference to the horsemen of the apocalypse, most policy makers and social researchers would not think of the humanities as sources of relevant and useful knowledge in the consideration of his indictment of humanity’s destructiveness and the complex array of humanity’s failiures towards itself and the world on which the continuation of our species depends.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s1.1"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-1">1. Beginnings</a></h3>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.2"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-2">1.1 An overview</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Over the past two decades, organisations representing the humanities in various Western nations have worked vigorously to affirm, especially to governments, the necessity of the humanities as a fundamental and distinctive dimension of human knowledge. Successes in modifying the effective exclusion of the humanities in official thinking have occurred but have not affected the completely dominant position of science and technology. The most striking instance of this situation is the subject of this book. In the nation states with which New Zealand would typically compare itself , national organisations representing the humanities were established before the impact of neoliberalism intensified their marginal status; one of their successes is simply their survival under the regime imposed by neoliberal thought. But no such independent national organisation had been created in New Zealand before the neoliberal catastrophe struck and the fact that, in the aftermath of the purist application of neoliberal conceptions of government, economy and society, an attempt to establish one failed simply makes the conditions largely determining the present situation and capacity of the humanities in Western democracies more vividly apparent.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This chapter aims to tell the story of the attempt during the last decade of the 1990s and the first decade of the twenty-first century by individuals and organisations in New Zealand to remedy this lack. Unlike other European and Anglo-American nations, New Zealand did not until the twenty-first century establish (briefly) a national organisation with the double function of representing the interests of the humanities to government and the public and of recognising the intellectual achievements of its professionals. In the first phase, an incorporated society, The New Zealand Academy for the Humanities Te Whāinga Aronui (HUMANZ) initiated in the 1990s a series of meetings and national conferences, wrote discussion papers, and formulated a strong conception of what such an organisation in and for Aotearoa New Zealand should be like and how it could work. In 2000, HUMANZ began a discussion with the then Labour Government, seeking official recognition and funding to fill the empty space in the representation of knowledge at the national level next to the Royal Society of New Zealand. The second phase began in 2005 when HUMANZ was replaced by The Humanities Trust of Aotearoa New Zealand, otherwise known as Te Whāinga Aronui The Council for the Humanities. The Council established the New Zealand Academy of the Humanities Te Mātanga o Te Whāinga Aronui in 2007 but was unable to achieve recognition and funding from the New Zealand Government; the Trust was wound up in 2009, some of its functions passing to the Royal Society of New Zealand. Given the shift in official thinking during the past two decades towards conceptions of societies and economies as knowledge–driven in a global environment but distinguished by cultural, historical and geographic factors, it should be remarkable that these developments occurred so late in international terms and should still be unacknowledged by the New Zealand government. This is particularly the case because, from one perspective, the body of knowledge gathered under the term humanities can be regarded as the traditional knowledge of British and European settlers, the source of the dominant culture in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Reviewing at this point two examples of developments during this period in the countries to which New Zealand is most closely related historically and culturally will provide a succinct context for interpreting this state of affairs. The first is the establishment in 2005 of the Arts and Humanities Research Council in the United Kingdom. The parallels with the situation of arts and humanities research in New Zealand are striking and suggest that a set of inherited factors underlie the lack of infrastructural development for knowledge creation in these fields. At the risk of gross simplification, while the British Academy, representing academic research in the arts, humanities and social sciences, had been in existence throughout the twentieth century, only the sciences and social sciences were represented by the research councils established to channel public funding to research. In the early 1990s the British Academy began a campaign for the completion of the spectrum of research councils. The extraordinary outcome was its failure; the legislation to establish the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) was defeated in Parliament, apparently the result of a perception that the inclusion of this segment of academic research would diminish funding to the sciences. Because the Government had expected that the Council would be established, funding which had been earmarked for it was retained and in 1998 the British Academy set up the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB) to administer that funding. The AHRB operated as a research council in all but name. Nearly a decade later, the process was repeated, this time successfully, and in 2005 arts and humanities research joined the sciences in the research councils structure., which is now administered through the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The AHRC has in a short time generated a strong account of research in these fields and programmes for its development, including research into the situation of the arts and humanities in order to argue for policy and funding improvements from the government. All of these actions demonstrate the value of investment in the arts and humanities and of having an organisation responsible for acting as an interface between them and the government. Observing what happened in the United Kingdom offered a clear warning, that any attempt to insert a new organisation into the existing governmental infrastructure for administering knowledge and to seek public funding for it, however justified it seemed, would not necessarily be successful.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The second example is Australian, the formation in 2004 of the Council for the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (CHASS). Although Australia has a fully developed Academies structure, partly funded by the government, and a joint Academies body had been set up to represent the interests of academic research as a whole to the government, it was clear to those in the Humanities and Social Science Academies that these fields were persistently marginalised in government policy for research and development, whether for research as such or research relevant to government interests. The case was vigorously argued that it was not in the national interest to exclude these domains of knowledge from participation in government policy development, and the result was the government’s decision to fund a peak body which would draw its representation from all the learned societies and professional organizations in arts, humanities and social sciences, and bring their expertise to bear on issues relevant to the future of Australia. CHASS and the AHRC were both set up to be interface bodies, mediating between researchers focussed on research as such and the government’s need for knowledge applicable to policy formation and social and economic development. As with the AHRC, CHASS sought to extend academics’ conceptions of the value and relevance of their research and the government’s ability to engage with and value that knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Broadly speaking, the framing concepts in official thinking about research in the United Kingdom and Australia within which these developments occurred was fundamentally the same as that in New Zealand.<sup><a id="note_2" href="#note2"></a>2</sup> Its main features are the dominance of scientific and technological research as the source of knowledge of value, the emphasis on that part of the economy directly dependent on scientifically generated knowledge, and the priority given to economic over social development.<sup><a id="note_3" href="#note3">3</a></sup> While parts of the cultural sector have been brought into this frame, notably creative industries, this has underlined the inherited distortion in the representation of the economy, when statistical collections are still basically defined by categories reified from the characteristics of the traditional industrial economy. But a critical difference between the three nations in respect of the humanities is that, at the time when the pressures for globalising research and economic policies became intense, in the last two decades of the twentieth century, both the United Kingdom and Australia had well-established national organisations, like the British Academy and the Australian Academy of the Humanities, to speak for the arts, humanities, and social sciences, whereas nothing similar had developed in New Zealand. Only one organisation, the Royal Society of New Zealand (RSNZ), which had evolved from its origins in the later nineteenth century as an inclusive knowledge organisation to focus on science only, was funded partly by the government as an Academy of Science and Technology. It underwent major changes during the 1990s, as did similar academy organisations in related countries under pressure from governments for more return from the public funding provided to them, especially through the provision of expert advice. The RSNZ emerged with a wider conception of its role, and a much enhanced position in its sector, including membership of the social sciences, in the context of government efforts to shift New Zealand from its dependence on primary commodity production. What follows in this chapter is an account of the attempt made to fill the gap in the national infrastructure for knowledge resulting from the absence of a research council and an advocacy body for the humanities.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.3"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-3">1.2 The local setting</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Until the mid-1980s research in New Zealand was publicly funded through the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) and the block grants to the universities. The creative arts were funded through the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council; the arts were not then thought of as engaged in research and claims that creativity is as much a factor in science as in the arts were not then apparently necessary as part of the case for scientific research. No body like the Australian Research Council existed to oversee academic research as a whole, a task which was carried out by the University Grants Committee until it was wound up by the government in 1989 and some of its responsibilities (but not its funds) were handed to the Vice-Chancellors’ Committee (NZVCC), now Universities New Zealand, which became the national advocate for the universities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">When the government moved in 1990 to bring contestable funding into the (science) research system, and to privilege research oriented towards government priorities, it dissolved the DSIR, created from its funding the Public Good Science Fund (PGSF), and formed a number of Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) which would gain their funding by bidding into the PGSF pool under a variety of output categories. In effect, for the first time, New Zealand acquired something like a research funding council system, except that there was one fund and administration for all publicly finded non-academic research (the universities became eligible to contest for research funding from the PGSF some years later). The social sciences were included in the PGSF, the arts and humanities were not. The reform process was not driven by scientists, one outcome of which was a disruption in the affairs of the RSNZ because scientists employed by DSIR and who opposed the changes did not get the support they sought from the RSNZ, which was governed by the RSNZ Academy Fellows. A new grouping of scientists was set up to contest the changes, and played a considerable part in the review of the RSNZ Act in the mid-1990s, which occasioned a major change in its constitution. A new governing body more broadly representative of the science-based professions, the Council of the Royal Society, displaced the Fellows, who became members of the Royal Society Academy within the RSNZ and were represented on the Council. In this way, the RSNZ responded to new demands from government for knowledge deemed relevant to government interests, a process which was occurring in other similar jurisdictions like Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. The traditional academy was not well constituted to meet this expectation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This brief narrative is necessary to provide a local contex, within an international process of structural change in government and the public sector, and a deeper epistemic change within democratic societies, for the response made on behalf of the humanities. In 1990, at a meeting of the university Deans of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, concern was expressed about the future of humanities research, given the introduction of contestable funding and the entry of the universities into the PGSF. Following this meeting, the Dean of Arts at the University of Canterbury, John Jennings, undertook to investigate whether a body representing the humanities could (and should) be established to represent the interests of the humanities nationally and, specifically, to campaign for research funding. Representatives of about 50 organisations (universities and others with interests in the arts, culture and the humanities) met in Wellington in 1991, agreed that action was needed, and set up a working group to draft a constitution for an incorporated society.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.4"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-4">1.3 Founding Ideas and Issues</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">But exactly what kind of an organisation was needed to represent the humanities? How should its aims be defined, and what should its name be? And what did “the humanities” encompass in New Zealand, both institutionally and in terms of domains of knowledge and practice, especially when there were two established knowledge traditions, the cultures of the indigenous Māori and the Pākehā (British and European settlers)? The disciplinary representation of the humanities differed from university to university, and humanities knowledge was at work in society in contexts which did not match academic disciplines. Furthermore, did “the humanities” also include “the arts”, or mātauranga Māori, or should those bodies of knowledge and aesthetic practice be separately named in the organisation’s title and Constitution? And – a question which was never finally answered, not least because most of the organisations represented at the first meeting, apart from the universities, were themselves small and depended on member subscriptions and voluntary work to achieve their aims - where were funds going to come from to make the work of representation both possible and on-going?</p>
<p class="noindent1">The broad answer to these questions was that it should be a national organisation, multi-institutional and multi-professional in its representaiton to ensure that the actual work of the humanities as a mode of learning and knowledge creation should be as fully represented as possible. It was decided not to put easily contested boundaries around its domain by adopting a definition of the humanities, but instead a statement of objects would define the scope of the organisation’s work, acceptance of which would provide the basis for membership.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Some initial decisions became guidelines: although organisations provided the basis for the first meeting, it was decided that only personal members could be elected to governance positions; if a small group of people were to attempt meaningful national representation of the humanities, the governing body would need to be made up of regional representatives, who would have a primary responsibility for engaging their regions in the work of the national organisation and informing it about regional concerns and issues; as a national organisation established to address the government on behalf of the humanities, it would need to be based in the capital city.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The working group met and exchanged documents, building on the guidelines from the 1991 meeting. Drafts of the Constitution were circulated for comment, with the aim of keeping consultation as open as possible. At a meeting in Wellington on 26 June 1992 the Draft Constitution was discussed and approved in principle, the English name was agreed and a procedure for determining an appropriate Māori name was decided, and an Interim Council (as the executive committee became known) was elected.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The primary task of the Interim Council of the New Zealand Academy of the Humanities was to prepare for the first General Meeting in 1993, at which the Constitution would be approved, the first Council elected, and the plans and programme for the launch of the new organisation decided. The Chair, John Jennings, closed the meeting with the following observation:</p>
<p class="quote">the point of no return had been passed. All those involved in the humanities are involved in fundamental intellectual activities which consider issues that are related to human life and human values. One important aim in research and teaching is to develop the skills and techniques of independent enquiry into issues central to our particular and distinctive culture in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The new organisation alone will not succeed in realising the objects adopted by this meeting. Personal commitment to the objects - to promote activites in the humanities and to increase public understanding of humanities - and hard work by the Council, are prerequisites to success. Public education will play a significant role.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.5"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-5"><i>1.3.1 Finding two names</i></a></h5>
<p><b>The New Zealand Academy for the Humanities.</b></p>
<p>Many of the conceptual issues which were raised in these discussions came into clearest focus in the matter of the English name. The term Academy was adopted, but this brought out clear differences of perspective; it would not elect Fellows (a patriarchal concept) but be based on personal and institutional members; those preferring the term Academy tended to work in universities, whereas those not so located perceived this term to have elitist implications; and what sense did this term make in Māori culture? Of particular importance was the distinctive location in New Zealand of this proposed national organisation, and the need to respect the partnership between Māori and Pākehā enshrined in the Treaty of Waitangi (1840).</p>
<p class="noindent1"><b>Te Whāinga Aronui</b></p>
<p>The gifting of the Maori name needs particular mention because it makes vividly apparent the anchoring of the humanities in culture, and that culture is specific to place, history and language. The meeting was clear that the organisation’s name should be brief, the term humanities should be understood to include the arts, and the objects should be taken biculturally, a position to be visibly exemplified in a Māori name. It was decided that Te Matawhanui, the Māori University Teachers' Association, would be approached. After various consultations with scholars and with Professor Timoti Karetu, Commissioner of Te Taura Whiri i Te Reo Māori the Māori Language Commission, the name Te Whāinga Aronui proposed by Te Matawhanui was confirmed. Professor Wharenui Milroy (Waikato University) explained that in Māori tradition, Tane fetched the baskets of knowledge including Te Kete Aronui from the heavens. This basket dealt specifically with the humanities and the welfare of people. Following Māori convention, the name was received as a gift from Professor Milroy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Te Whāinga Aronui is not a translation of the English name but invokes Māori concepts and traditions. Prosaically, it can be translated as “The way ahead for the humanities.” It is important to emphasise the force of a name which has its roots in Māori knowledge traditions and was in no way positioned as subordinate to the dominant English traditions of knowledge by being merely a translation of the English name. It evokes “New Zealand” because Māori is the language unique to the islands making up the territory of the modern nation. It recognised, as the new organisation continued to attempt to recognise, the incommensurability of the two traditions and the need to engage both in its work.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is also for this reason that the hybrid term humanities-aronui became commonly used in Academy policy papers and conferences. It was used to describe the distinctive bilingual and bicultural environment in which, in the context of global and multi-cultural perspectives, the on-going formation of culture and language occurs in Aotearoa New Zealand, and hence also the formation of a distinctive mode of the humanities, New Zealand humanities. Aotearoa had for a long time been accepted in English as the Māori name for New Zealand, and was increasingly being used in a similarly hybrid form as the name for the nation. In this way, a major difference between the humanities and the sciences was simply identified; cultural knowledge in both indigenous and settler traditions did not have universal application but evolved locally and differentiated itself over time both from its own origins and in interactions between the two principal knowledge traditions and languages.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.6"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-6">1.4 Widening Consultation</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">To further broaden the range of input into the formative process, people not at the 1991 and 1992 Wellington meetings were contacted for their views. One group came together for a half-day meeting in Wellington; they were provided with copies of the draft Objects and the draft programme for the launch of the Academy, and were asked to consider the following questions:</p>
<p class="quote">1. What should be the top priorities of the Academy?<br/>2. Are there Objects or specific functions which are not included at present?<br/>3. Does the Launch programme give a clear signal that the Academy is attempting to position itself in relation to a New Zealand and international future perspective?<br/>4. Which persons and organisations do you think would be useful in the development of the Academy and/or as a contributor to the Launch event?</p>
<p class="noindent1">Out of these discussions emerged a practical answer to two linked questions: “How could a small executive committee based on one member from each of 6 regions (basically the main centres, but therefore also the university cities) hope to represent the diversity of interests in the arts, culture and the humanities either in their region or nationally?”; and, “Where could an organisation dependent for its base funding on member subscriptions find sufficient resources to achieve this representation, fulfil the Academy’s objects in a way which would meet members’ expectations, and encourage the growth and public recognition of the Academy?” The fundamental insight was that the Academy had to plan its activities and projects in partnerships with established organisations in its sphere of activity, drawing upon its collective resources of knowledge and drawing into collaborative events and projects a diversity of interests and perspectives which would illustrate a theme or policy issue. Each project or event should have a strategic value, advancing understanding of the distinctive contribution the Academy could make because it was there to link together nationally and regionally humanistically trained people in mutually beneficial, public conversations. The plan for the Launch was designed to exemplify this approach.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In retrospect, the seeds of all of the subsequent developments initiated by the Academy can be found in the records of these discussions. The most important, to be discussed in more detail later, were:</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.7"><i>1.4.1 Creating an advisory board</i></h5>
<p>Creating an advisory board of persons of distinction in the arts and humanities to advise the Council on matters of relevance to the work and development of the Academy. The absence of any equivalent to a body of distinguished Fellows suggested this as a possible solution to the problem of the limited representation of the sector by Council members alone. Persons of standing in their respective communities of endeavour would thus be closely identified with the Academy’s work. Such a group would exemplify the scope of the Academy by careful choice, and their working together would provide a very useful model of how cross-disciplinary and cross-professional relations might be worked out on a larger scale within the Academy and between it and other related organisations. It could ensure a flow of advice into the Council which Council members, however well-intentioned and however wide their interests, could probably not achieve by themselves. As it turned out, informal consultations with such people were an important source of advice and of participants in conferences and seminars, but the formal establishment of such a group had to wait until the founding of the Academy of the Humanities in 2007, when it was expected that the Fellows would constitute a kind of advisory board and make their expertise available as a reciprocal to their becoming Fellows.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.8"><i>1.4.2 Contributing to public policy formation for the humanities</i></h5>
<p>Focussed and applied expertise would be needed to perform this critical function. The formation of think tanks during this period as a means of focussing highly trained intelligence on matters of sectoral and public interest offered a possible model. The concept of an Institute for the New Humanities was briefly considered, in the context of coming to understand more about the kinds of work being undertaken by humanities organisations in other countries. The nearest the Academy came to implementing such a concept was in the development of the Knowledge Policy Research Group, and the creation of the Steering Committee of the History of Print Culture in New Zealand research project. An Advisory Board meeting the description in the previous paragraph was established for the Print Culture project as an expert (and multi-professional) body able to advise on project development and provide public endorsement of the worth of the project.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.9"><i>1.4.3 Providing services</i></h5>
<p>It was also recognised that the Academy could not depend only upon good will and commitment to the founding idea as the terms on which people became, and stayed, as members. The Academy would have to provide services of value to members. Holding conferences in different regions on broad topics of current relevance to the sector rather than to specific academic disciplines, and under the auspices of museums and galleries as well as universities, was one approach, which was also designed to identify and scope policy issues the Academy should be taking up.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.10"><i>1.4.4 Communicating with its sector</i></h5>
<p>A newsletter, HUMANZ, was first published in 1994 with the intention that it would circulate beyond the membership as a means of informing potential members about and promoting the Academy more widely; the very small beginnings of an information service were made in its diary section. But it also became quickly apparent that it would be very difficult either to expand such a service very far in that format, or to enlarge its scope and maintain its accuracy through voluntary effort.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Even so, it was apparent that a powerful and practical way of defining the role and scope of the Academy while meeting a generally perceived need would be for the Academy to institute and maintain an information network which would record in the form of a diary all events, significant activities and programmes, conferences, visitors etc in the humanities nationally. It was also clear (before the birth of the World Wide Web), that such a diary would need to be computerised and be able to be accessed through a network as well as in other formats. It would operate as a service to members, but it was considered that it could be sold as a service to non-members both as a whole and selectively (an instance of the need to undertake work that could return funding to the Academy, which was and would continue to be a constant preoccupation of the executive committee). In the event, this proposal was implemented in the form of the Humanities Research Network a decade later.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.11"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-11">1.5 Initiating national and international relations</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Bringing the existence of the Academy to the attention of government organisations in New Zealand and to humanities organisations in other countries opened up further dimensions of the work of the Academy during this inaugural period. Among government Ministries and other agencies the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology, the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Mātauranga, The National Museum Te Papa Tongarewa, The National Archives, Te Puni Kokiri The Ministry of Māori Affairs, and the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee, were the most immediately important. Although education as a major domain of government activity was clearly of fundamental interest to the humanities, at this stage the Ministry of Education’s brief was for the whole of the system except universities. This was to change when the Tertiary Education Commission was set up in 2003. Initial meetings with officials were constructive, and important associations developed through the 1990s.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But there were two difficulties of major significance for the Academy. Firstly, no Ministry recognised a particular responsibility for the humanities; and, as a consequence, making a case for funding of the Academy’s work could be successful only on a project by project basis. This state of affairs was confirmed in another way by an early assessment of the diversity of issues in public policy in which the Academy should be interested. The list looks like what it is, a process of writing the humanities in to areas of government activity and development from which they were missing, and at a time of rapid and extensive social, economic and governmental change:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the role of the humanities in education and training</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the role of the media in society</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the role of humanities in the information society</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the role of the humanities in the economy</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the role of the humanities in cultural development and change.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Implied in this simple list is most of the representational and policy-oriented work done by the Academy on behalf of the humanities during the 1990s, culminating in the DICE programme of meetings in 2000 which will be discussed later. Secondly, the time had passed when the humanities could be regarded as a “good thing” by government as patron on behalf of the public; instead, an organisation seeking funding for public interest purposes had to be able to offer services which the government deemed were needed nationally but which it would not itself provide.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Contacts with people and organisations working directly on the interface with government were also inititated. Reasons similar to those motivating the establishment of the Academy motivated the formation of the Federation of New Zealand Social Science Organisations (FoNZSSO), and their representative attended the 26 June 1992 meeting. Unlike the humanities but like the sciences, the social sciences had both discipline–based and professional accreditation organizations, which led to the decision to set up a federal body rather than one based on personal members. Ultimately, however, neither approach provided a secure or sufficient source of funding to enable the adequate and independent development of a strong national organisation. The solution adopted by FoNZSSO was made possible following the review of the RSNZ Act in 1997, which widened the RSNZ to include the social sciences and set up a college within the RSNZ Academy for the election of Social Science Fellows. The Panel conducting the review commented that there had been considerable discussion over whether the humanities should be included in the revised conception of the RSNZ, and about the difficulty of defining a boundary between the humanities and the social sciences; but whether or not there should be a separate academy for the arts and humanities was beyond the terms of the review, and including the humanities would have required extensive changes to the Objects of the RSNZ. The fact that these matters were considered at all shows how much change in thinking and in organisational relationships was occurring in the early 1990s, and is a significant anticipation of what subsequently took place more than a decade later with the assimilation into RSNZ of the humanities. The setting up of Te Tumu Toi The Arts Foundation in 2000, with the aim of recognising and financially rewarding life-time achievement in the arts, exemplifes the long-standing relation between the creative arts and the corporate sector, an association not readily available to the humanities.<sup><a id="note_4" href="#note4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">A more general theme running through all these relationships is knowledge boundaries. Building a representative body based on an inclusive conception of the humanities required linking the current traditional academic humanities disciplines, creative and performing arts, mātauranga Māori, law, qualitative social sciences, the cultural professions which manage the resource-base for creative and critical research, and the media professions and systems in which this research is formulated and by which it is circulated and conserved. This spectrum of knowledge work was distributed over various government Ministries, and otherwise represented in segments by many discipline- and profession-oriented organisations. Even if a logic of association could be found which would extend beyond the academic humanities, was it conceivable that there could be sufficient in common at the national level between this body of knowledges and that of science and technology for one organisation, like RSNZ, to encompass the whole knowledge spectrum and provide equality of representation? My answer then, and now, is No; and that is a primary reason for this book.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Understanding what kinds of services might be required by or of interest to the government was much assisted by making contact with the national humanities organisations in other countries. A crucial decision was made by the United States Information Service to fund the Interim President, Dr Brian Opie, to attend the 1992 Modern Language Association conference in New York, and to engage subsequently in a programme of visits to a variety of organisations in the arts and humanities. These visits provided very important and timely information, not only about the spectrum of agencies involved at a national and state level in some aspect of the arts and humanities, but also about the issues of most concern to them and the forms being taken by advocacy. The single most important meeting was with Dr Stanley Katz, then President of the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS). The future of the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities was in doubt, and major changes in government policies concerning knowledge and digital technologies were being undertaken with little consideration for the arts and humanities. It was a remarkable opportunity, being brought fully into acquaintance with front line work on behalf of the humanities as the new information order was taking shape.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.12"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-12">1.6 The Inaugural General Meeting and the Launch of The New Zealand Academy for the Humanities Te Whāinga Aronui, 25-26 June 1993</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1" style="margin-top:2em;">The Inaugural General Meeting (IGM) was held in Wellington on the evening before the Launch. The IGM adopted the Constitution, members signing the documents for incorporation, and confirmed the membership of the First Council following member nominations in an electoral procedure that did not require an election because the number of nominations was equal to the number of places to be filled. This situation was typically repeated throughout the life-time of the Academy, Council places usually being filled following recommendations from retiring Council members.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The members of the First Council were: Richard Corballis (Manawatu),<br />Alastair Fox (Otago), Mary Houston (Wellington –Treasurer), Deborah Jones (Waikato), Jonathan Mané-Wheoki (Canterbury–Vice-President)<br />Brian Opie (Wellington - President), Terry Sturm (Auckland); Michael Volkerling (Wellington).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Objects, or Kaupapa, of the Academy were:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">1.</span> To promote public support for all aspects of the humanities.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">2.</span> To provide an independent public voice on all matters affecting the humanities to government, commerce, industry, and the media.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">3.</span> To contribute to the growth of knowledge in the humanities by initiating, co-ordinating and facilitating research, scholarship and publication.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">4.</span> To organise public lectures, seminars and conferences.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">5.</span> To establish a strong and representative organisation for the humanities.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">6.</span> To establish and maintain contacts with similar organisations world-wide.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">7.</span> To recognise distinguished service to the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The aim of the Launch Conference, which was held at the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Mātauranga, was to place the Academy in an international context as well as to open up policy themes of national significance for the humanities and bring together people making active use of humanistic knowledge in both Māori and Pākehā knowledge traditions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The conference began with a Powhiri, a formal Māori greeting, and it was opened by the then Minister of Cultural Affairs, The Hon Douglas Graham.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The opening keynote address. “Looking towards the 21st Century; the role of the humanities in Aotearoa/New Zealand”, was given by Dr Claudia Orange, Editor of the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. It was followed by a panel on <i>Humanities and Public Policy;</i> and then the meeting broke into discussion groups on the following topics:</p>
<p class="quote1"><i>Research in the humanities</i>. The discovery, circulation and uses of humanities knowledge;</p>
<p class="quote1"><i>Databases for the humanities</i>. Social and cultural memory; libraries; museums/galleries; information technology;</p>
<p class="quote1"><i>The arts and the humanities.</i> Humanities learning from, informing and being informed by the arts; and</p>
<p class="quote1"><i>The media and the humanities.</i> The role of the humanities in communications media.</p>
<p>It concluded with a plenary session where reports were made on issues arising in each group.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This conference in effect laid out the broad scheme of issues and work which the Academy would attempt to address in the following years. Although much that was discussed throughout the day was already in humanities researchers’ minds, two areas opened up challenges to humanities practitioners which were also challenges to the Academy. To attempt to affect the rapidly changing world order as it erupted in New Zealand required engaging in policy discussions and effective representations to government, and to recognise the critical role of the media in all the processes of disseminating knowledge and information and defining the matters for debate in the public sphere. In the event, the Academy Council focussed on the relation to government and the attempt to affect policy, and tried to bring its activities into the media space as much as possible. But the deeper issues raised about the humanities’ relation to the media –</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>becoming more adept at making academic knowledge more accessible to the public through the media for the public good;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>ensuring the retention of a non-commercial public radio network and the establishment of a non-commercial public television channel under a charter that would guarantee their independence and define their democratic role as contributing to public understanding of New Zealand society in its global conext, developing cultural, artistic and musical awareness and encouraging debate on the issues of the day; and</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>assisting the development of investigative journalism -</p>
<p class="noindent1">were prescient, directly pertinent to a conception of applied or public humanities, and unable to be advanced because of the slenderness of the resources the Academy was able to marshall to support its work. The issue of public radio and television continues to haunt the otherwise unrelenting commercialisation of media in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The launch of the Academy brought together people with diverse professional and personal interests in the humanities and began the process of forming an organisation able to represent that diversity nationally and publicly. Over 100 people attended, the majority from out of Wellington. The Academy's commitment to recognising the partnership between the two principal humanities traditions in New Zealand, Māori and Pākehā, was strongly reaffirmed at the launch. All those present were faced with the two principal measures of the future success of the Academy: becoming an organisation in which the partnership between Māori and Pākehā was a reality; and providing articulate advocacy for the humanities in all aspects of public policy, especially in the context of continuing reductions in government investment in the arts, humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p class="noindent1">More of the flavour of the moment, in which in all aspects of New Zealand society and government were undergoing the turmoil of structural change, is given in Dr Orange’s keynote address. She established a context for her discussion of the role of the humanities by referring to “two significant features of the condition of New Zealand - a perceived lack of national vision, and an increasingly diverse population and culture.” She affirmed that this period of rapid change was accompanied by an “uncoordinated, ad hoc and uncertain situation over national issues […] the Academy has a crucial role to play - central to developing a New Zealand that is confident and vigorous in the many expressions of its identity and culture.” Those at the Launch were reminded that “we share much in common: we work in areas that are concerned with human experience. We deal with knowledge that is - potentially at least - socially transformative.” The principal features of New Zealand, “Small in size, few in numbers, mixed backgrounds […] are the very strengths which will enable us to redraw the boundaries of activity in the humanities. For it is clear that the traditional definition of the humanities as the province of academic study is too narrow and too short-sighted. Already the Academy has pointed the way by the democratic structure of this conference.” Dr Orange identified four large areas to be carefully considered in the establishment of the Academy: structures, resources, communications, and programmes. The need for “working structures appropriate to the New Zealand scene” was supported by noting that “While a central body for the Academy is essential, regional input and decision-making is critical to [its] vitality and growth”, and by reference to the differing structures being developed by other major cultural institutions like the Arts Council and the Museum of New Zealand. Dr Orange noted that they were responding institutionally in varying ways to Māori traditions and interests, and asked, "which way for the Academy?"</p>
<p class="noindent1">On funding, Dr Orange identified “The need to achieve a better balance in the valuation of the economic and social importance of the humanities in relation to science and technology” pointed towards cooperative work with the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. On databases, Dr Orange emphasised the lack of, and the urgent need for, information sources in all areas of work in the humanities. Communications “will be one of the most important functions of the Academy. A co-ordinating role by the 21st century will see the Academy […] ensuring that the significance of new knowledge is interpreted to as wide a spectrum of the populace as possible; ensuring that knowledge is used in the context of activities of value.” On research programmes, Dr Orange instanced the <i>Dictionary of New Zealand Biography</i> as an example of humanities research which is national in scope, collaborative and, in its results, producing knowledge which enhances “the historical awareness of the nation [and is] accessible to as wide a range of the public as possible.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">In her conclusion, Dr Orange affirmed that “A nation's vision - its sense of identity and self-worth - lies in the memory of its past, in the appreciation of its present (with all its multitudinous facets and participants), and in a sense of anticipation (even excitement) in the possibilities of its future. The humanities must play a central and co-ordinated part in developing and cultivating that vision. It is too large a matter for the few, whether academics, politicians or public servants. It needs a representative group - one ready to take the humanities to humanity, and to reinvigorate the humanities with humanity.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">The force and point of her conclusion remains, even if the organisation which offered her grounds for hope that the humanities could be at the centre of the process of transforming a nation’s vision of itself and being transformed in turn did not survive the first decade of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But, at this moment, even with the already visible issue of how to fund the quite startling scheme of work presenting itself to the Academy, the future did seem open and confidence was high in the conception of the Academy given full expression in the Launch conference. The organisation in 1993 of a national lecture tour by a leading American academic theorist of the information society, was also a remarkable success, not least because it helped identify the Academy with significant contemporary issues in the humanities. Professor Mark Poster, of the Centre for Critical Theory, University of California at Irvine, was heard by about 1000 people at meetings in the main centres, and his visit was recorded in various media. This tour demonstrated the existence of a significant public audience for challenging ideas about the social and cultural implications of new information technology; but it could not have happened without sponsorship, in this instance from The Trustees of the National Library and Telecom NZ. It also proved the concept of project partnerships as a principal means by which the Academy could advance a programme of events and activities with public significance for the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The first consequence of the encounters with other national organisations representing the humanities was the making of invitations to the then President of the AAH, Professor Deryck Schreuder, and the then Chairman of the British Academy, Sir Antony Kenny, to attend the launch of the Academy. Short notice made their presence impossible, but messages of congratulation from them and from the President of ACLS, Dr Stanley Katz, were read at the Launch. It was a very welcome beginning for the New Zealand Academy for the Humanities Te Whāinga Aronui, to be assured of support and cooperation from these related organisations, and a valuable testimony to relationships of critical importance to the future development of the Academy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But this was not all. Although Dr Katz was unable to attend the Launch of the Academy, he came to New Zealand shortly afterwards, met with Council members and government officials and spoke in various settings about current issues in both research and philanthopy. While in New Zealand, he decided that the convergence of issues facing the arts and humanities in Western societies meant that it would be useful to bring together representatives from arts and humanities organisations in various national jurisdictions to share knowledge and methods of dealing with the new challenges. The first meeting occurred in San Francisco in 1995, and set a pattern for annual meetings through the rest of the decade. From the Academy’s point of view, these meetings were without qualification the most critical source of current thinking on large issues which were also at the heart of the problems facing the humanities in the new order, and provided invaluable access to people who were doing this thinking and the documents they produced for their own governments. Given the historical similarities between Australia and New Zealand, it is hardly surprising that the AAH became the closest associate of the Academy in the evolution of its work. But this could not have made such a positive difference if the AAH had not been engaged in changing its conception of its role, as was the ACLS for exactly the same reasons. Perhaps the single most important value to be gained from this opening of horizons was the encounter with very knowledgable, admirable people with much experience of working on the interface between the arts and humanities and the agencies of the state and who were deeply committed to advancing the interests of the arts and humanities in this complex coming into being of postmodernity.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.13"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-13">1.7 One Strategic Plan and Two Policy Papers</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">After the launch, it was imperative to define priorities. The Council knew that it needed access to more management expertise than it had amongst its members to develop a management plan and was fortunate to find people who could volunteer that expertise. It was also fortunate that a member of the Council, Michael Volkerling, was widely experienced in government financial and strategic planning. The outcome was the <i>Strategic Plan and Budget 1994-97</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Plan was developed from a close analysis of the Academy’s Objects, and built on a re-presentation of them as four modes of activity with specific financial features, as follows:</p>
<p class="slist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Services (conferences, visiting speakers, information service) [project funding]</p>
<p class="slist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Public education (campaigns, policy formation) [sponsored]</p>
<p class="slist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Academy projects (symbolic events, publications) [fund raising]</p>
<p class="slist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Proactive research and development (new policies for the humanities, new knowledge in the humanities) [project funding]</p>
<p class="noindent1">By detailing the kinds of activities implied by each category, it became possible to understand how activities could be prioritised, in respect of both immediate effect and finding sources of funding, and phased in over the three year period.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It also made clear what kind of administrative base would have to be set up for the Plan to work. The (unsurprising) requirements, including an Executive Director, were:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>a national office equipped to initiate and maintain effective communication<br />
-- internationally, with other Academies and comparable organisations both in the Pacific and in Europe<br />
-- nationally, with government, business, education, cultural institutions and organisations, the media<br />
-- and regionally, with Academy members and regionally based institutions and organisations;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>an adequately resourced Council able to represent the views of members, to formulate new policies and to enhance public understanding of the importance and scope of the humanities in the late C20th;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>a regional presence to ensure that local and national activities are closely interrelated;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>a database identifying the diverse kinds of expertise of members and others in the humanities so that the work of the Academy can be based on the best sources of information and advice;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>a reliable, national information service to members providing general access to activities, programmes, visitors, grants and awards, conferences, seminars, and public meetings.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Budget accompanying the Plan estimated the total income required to fund it and the effect of expansion over three years to be: 1994 - $152,000; 1995 - $167,000; 1996 - $187,000. These figures were so far out from the actual income of the Academy at that point that it could have been more sensible, with that realistic information, to decide not to proceed. The Budget, as it had to, stated the obvious in its preamble: “How far and how quickly the Academy can develop is a function of income. A critical issue is the proportion of the operating costs of the Academy which can be provided from members’ subscriptions.” It then offered several options to members for finding these amounts of money:</p>
<p class="quote">O<small>PTION</small> 1. the Academy has a part-time secretariat devoted to Member Services and Public Education financed wholly from subscription revenue (calculated on the basis of 1000 members paying $50 annually);</p>
<p class="quote">O<small>PTION</small> 2. the Academy has a full-time secretariat undertaking the full programme funded wholly by subscription revenue (calculated on the basis of 1000 members paying $125 annually);</p>
<p class="quote">O<small>PTION</small> 3. the Academy has a full-time secretariat funded by a mix of subscriptions, grants, and sponsorship which would also carry out the full programme. In this case, grant and sponsorship revenue totalling $102,000 would have to be raised by 31 March 1994.</p>
<p class="quote">Even Option I requires both a 500% increase in membership and a 250% increase in the subscription. The budget demonstrates that some such development is essential; without a rapid increase in funds, the Academy cannot expect to survive as a significant organisation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Anyone familiar with this situation would know that it was quite unlikely for the Council, or the membership, either to give up at this point or to accept such fee increases. And since membership was voluntary, at the level of membership fees humanities academics would tolerate it would be impossible to develop a competent organisation with membership fees alone, even if every academic were to join. Project funding and partnerships with other organisations would be necessary and, until a sufficient level of income could be assured, work for the Academy would have to be voluntary. If the Academy had been developed as a professional body, the fee level estimated in the Budget would have been quite normal; but there was no move for that kind of organisation, even though every other science-related profession had such a body (which, incidentally, also took an interest in curricula development and the standing of qualifications). In this respect, as in many others, the humanities represented the persistence in the modern scientific university of the residue of the pre-modern institution and its mode of professional formation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the context of policy changes in education and the increasing use of charters, mission statements and audit procedures to judge whether public sector organisations were fulfilling their obligations, the NZVCC set up its own Academic Audit Unit in 1993 to conduct audits of the universities; it also held meetings to receive input about the effectiveness of its audit procedures from the spectrum of professional bodies with interests in university degrees. The Society was invited to participate in these meetings, which were very informative. The absence of professional bodies providing an interface between arts degrees and the work-force was striking – and disadvantageous to academic development in those programmes, since most arts and humanities students, like students in all other degree programmes, join the workforce outside the university rather than find employment in it. This was another important interface area in the evolving infrastructure linking knowledge organisations outside the universities into academic development and government policies for education and employment.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The meetings and the ongoing contacts with other national humanities organisations helped the Council position the Academy as a channel through which international thinking about the position of the arts and humanities in the changing global order of research, education and digital networks could be interpreted into New Zealand. This became a key function of the annual conferences which the Council organised in its attempt to present issues relevant to all humanities researchers and to the government, rather than to follow existing discipline orientations. It was also clear that relevant work was being done by professionals in the various national and regional cultural institutions, and that relations between academic researchers and other professionals in the field of the arts, culture and the humanities needed to be foregrounded in the Academy’s work.</p>
<p class="noindent1">So, the only solution was to work to the Budget, and the Plan, but on those activities for which funding and voluntary contributions of expertise could be found. That meant conferences, meetings, submissions to government and, most importantly, policy formulation.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.14"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-14"><i>1.7.1 Research policy</i></a></h5>
<p>Discussion about the form and content of an Academy research policy for the arts, culture and the humanities had been under discussion more or less from the beginning, but the push to formulate it as the documentary basis of representations to the government followed the formal establishment of the Academy and its Council in 1993. The Council developed a research policy drawing substantially upon the knowledge derived from participation in meetings with the other national organisations led by the ACLS, and by the follow-up work so much facilitated by the Internet (just like the more potent flow of ideas into New Zealand government policy from international business).</p>
<p class="noindent1">On the principle that the modes and ends of research in the humanities required a different approach to that of the sciences, a key element in the policy was a proposal for a research funding body complementary to the PGSF for the sciences, a Public Good Fund for Research in Culture and Society. The anchoring statement was: The Academy believes that the development of a national knowledge policy is critical to the successful transition of New Zealand from a resource-based to a knowledge-based society. The formation of a national knowledge policy must be a fully collaborative process including all the principal producers and users of New Zealand's intellectual capital.” One part of the argument had to do with a key cultural and social function of the humanities, their contribution to the maintenance of democratic societies through the education of new generations of their citizens in democratic principles, traditions and values; another had to do with the contribution of the humanities to innovation and economic development.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Various reports and strategy documents provided the means for the Academy to sharpen its policy teeth and become familiar with the modes of discourse and structures of thought through which policy documents were created. A good illustration is work which was being done in in 1993 on research strategies for the social sciences by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (FRST), which administered the allocation of research funding from the PGSF.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In comments on a FRST paper concerned with the social sciences, the Academy wrote that</p>
<p class="quote">The use of ‘social research’ and ‘social science research’ as possibly equivalent terms (but then perhaps not) through the paper indicates an area of critical ambivalence in the whole project of attempting to justify and expand the presence of social science research within the present Foundation framework, let alone attempting to introduce the humanities. The term ‘science’ effectively discriminates against (because it questions the credibility of) qualitative research methodologies which are characteristic of the humanities and significant elements of those disciplines which have come to be grouped as ‘social sciences’. […] The logical conclusion is that at least one more Foundation for Research must be established in which the interests and conventions of scientific and technological research are not determinative. Such a step is necessary if the public investment in the provision of knowledge necessary for the future development and management of New Zealand as a competent twenty first century society is to be adequately repaid. […]</p>
<p class="quote">The report, <i>Bridging the Gap. The Social Sciences and Humanities in Australia</i> (1993), by the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC), observes that</p>
<p class="quotea">In Australia and overseas, the emphasis on science and technology has, to a significant extent, been shaped by the assumption that investment in research will lead to products and hence economic growth. This linear model assumes that science has its origins outside society, that basic scientific discoveries are translated into technologies which result in economic growth. However, this model is incomplete, since it takes no account of the mutual interaction between society and science and technology. […]</p>
<p class="quotea">In ASTEC's view, the complex interactions of knowledge, society, technology and change are of fundamental importance to Australia's future. The model of society which underlies much current thinking about science and technology policy is inadequate, and must be strengthened by a more explicit recognition of human and social factors. [..]</p>
<p class="quotea">Government is a major funder of research and shapes the institutions which perform that research in the social sciences and the humanities. It is also a major user of research results, in areas such as the economy as a whole, health and welfare, issues related to Aboriginal people, and family law. This gives the government a major interest in the organisation of the humanities and social sciences and in policy-making in relation to them. However, there is no focus for policy about the organisation, funding, research, or training and skills requirements in the same way as there exists a Minister with responsibilities for science, an ASTEC, and Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council or a Coordination Committee on Science and Technology. (2, 3, 6)</p>
<p class="noindent1">This example makes it unavoidably clear that a public policy for research in the arts and humanities in the 1990s had to address both the sciences and the ill-defined space (disciplinary as well as in policy) where the modern humanities and social sciences overlapped, and that the issues being encountered were not unique to New Zealand, even though culture, history and the post-colonial settlement between indigenous and settler components of the population would require distinctive policy outcomes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One further example can succinctly complete this sketch of the situation facing the Academy. A sentence in the November 1994 Executive Summary to <i>New Avenues for Crown Funded Social Science Research</i> located the fundamental, long term, infrastructural and investment issues for both the Social Sciences and Humanities in arguing for an appropriate conception of their contribution to the creation of new knowledge in and of New Zealand:</p>
<p class="quote">The review reveals what social science does not have: a history of being nurtured by a strong government department, a powerful professional organisation lobbying for its interests, or a mechanism to describe ongoing and completed research.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This report opened a correspondence with the Minister for Research, Science and Technology the Hon Simon Upton, one letter (3 December 1995) making the point that “the historical underinvestment in infrastructure and research training for the Social Sciences will undoubtedly be significant in the process of inclusion of the Humanities/Aronui in the present research funding system”, especially in the context of the competitive basis for the allocation of public research funding from the PGSF.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The issue of HUMANZ for May 1995 carried a copy of the whole Research Policy document as it had been developed to that point, seeking responses and noting that it would be discussed at the 1995 Conference. The account of the humanities-aronui as a body of knowledge and modes of creating it which were distinctive and could not be simply inserted into a science-based concpetion of research and the uses of knowledge served as a foundational text for much of the subsequent work and activities of the Academy, not unlike the Ten Commandments. Its position was defined in this way:</p>
<p class="quote">The humanities/aronui are that body of knowledge and those modes of enquiry and reflection which concern what it is to be human<sup><a id="note_5" href="#note5">5</a></sup>, including our inhumanity and our relation to the non-human. In the Western tradition, the humanities have been identified with literacy and with value-laden knowledge, the core requirements for establishing and maintaining a civil society. They connect the texts of the law with those of religion, philosophy, ethics, economics, history, science, technology, the arts and architecture.</p>
<p class="quote">In the more holistic Māori world view te kete aronui (the basket of secular or profane knowledge), one of nga kete wananga (the three baskets of knowledge), may encompass theoretical and practical knowledge about the sciences as well as the humanities. The other kete contain ritual knowledge and occult knowledge (about witchcraft, evil, war), respectively. Love, compassion and peace ensure that wananga aronui is used for benevolent purposes but the possibility remains that it will be used instead for evil and destructive purposes.</p>
<p class="quote">The humanities/aronui are diffusive. Because it is value laden, knowledge in any aspect of the humanities/aronui may be (but is not necessarily) significant in any other aspect; because its medium is language in whatever mode (spoken, written, in print, on television or the information superhighway) humanities knowledge cannot be pure or universal knowledge but is always caught up in the processes of social and cultural change. Its ultimate ‘products’ are citizens capable of playing a full part in the shaping of their society, beyond the economic roles of producers and consumers.</p>
<p class="quote">The humanities/aronui are also accumulative: new knowledge is not necessarily better than old knowledge; specialist knowledge exists in a spectrum with popular knowledge and local knowledge rather than providing the only correct account. The texts of the past are always available to be read, viewed or heard again by anyone in the present and have power to modify the future.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One very significant issue, which was nowhere present in New Zealand government thinking, was highlighted in the Policy document by drawing from a report by the Social Science Federation of Canada, <i>Basic Research in the Social Sciences</i> (1984), which stated that</p>
<p class="quote">Social reality is not the same in North America, in Japan and in Europe; there is not even homogeneity between Canada and the United States. Unlike the natural sciences, the social sciences are highly specific. And also contrary to the situation prevailing in the natural sciences, Canada cannot rely on foreign countries to produce the necessary knowledge of itself. The study of Canadian social realities must always remain 98% Canadian. Knowledge of other societies matters to us and must be promoted for our own self-interest: amongst other things it serves to have a better understanding of the specificity of our own human environment. (7)</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Research Policy paper extended the force of this observation towards the humanities by stating that</p>
<p class="quote">New theories of culture and interpretations of history are challenging the now conventional disciplinary divisions in the humanities just as changes in economic and political relations have shifted New Zealand’s focus from Europe to the Pacific and to Asia. Not only is cultural knowledge, both of ourselves and of other societies, an increasingly important factor in our competence as a nation in the world economy, but it has been observed in <i>Humanities and the Arts on the Information Highways</i>, p. 35, that ‘The humanities and the arts […] are the producers of the intellectual property that will be one of the nation’s most valuable economic resources in the new information economy.’</p>
<p class="noindent1">The second quotation is from the 1994 report on a national initiative sponsored by the Getty Art History Information Program, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Coalition for Networked Information. These two quotations can stand in for the complex of issues and relationships which the Academy was attempting to manage in formulating its fundamental policy on research. They locate the international resources on which the Academy was able to draw, and the convergence of postmodern developments in disciplinary discourses, new information and communications technologies and their cultural and economic implications, and new geopolitical alignments which were critical factors shaping a new environment for arts and humanities research and modifying the inherited forms and conventions of that research.</p>
<h6 class="sec4" id="s1.15">1.7.1.1 The Marsden Fund</h6>
<p>In 1994 the then Minister for Research, Science and Technology, the Hon Simon Upton, responded to criticism from scientists whose research did not fit the priority criteria of the PGSF by creating the Marsden Fund, competition for funding from which would be based on the sole criterion of excellence. It was (and is) administered by RSNZ, not FRST, in order to make its difference from government priorities clear. This decision provided an opening for the Academy to propose the inclusion of the humanities in the fund, requiring a much more limited case than that which had defined the formation of research policy for the arts and humanities to this point. On 17 April 1996 the Council was represented by its President and a Council member, Dr Deborah Jones, at a meeting of the Ministerial Advisory Group for Research, Science and Technology for an exploratory discussion about the inclusion of the humanities in the “research, science and technology system”, as the invitation defined it. The Minister, the Hon Simon Upton, was present and directed the discussion, which was based on the premise that it was now feasible to include the humanities within the Marsden Fund and even to modify the Output categories of the PGSF to admit the humanities. The Minister’s response to representations from the Council of the Academy based on its research policy was to widen the scope of the Marsden Fund to include the humanities. A new Humanities Panel was constituted, and the Council ‘s nominee for its first Chair, Professor Sturm, was accepted.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At this time it was acknowledged that this decision was a first step towards a fuller consideration of research funding for the humanities and the role of the PGSF; it was also clear that it was only because the Minister promised an increase in Marsden funding that the entry of the humanities was accepted by scientists. This achievement was of more symbolic and practical than financial significance to the humanities, in the sense that the amount of money made available for humanities research was about 0.15% of the whole PGSF. But it did acknowledge the need to make contestable public funding available to humanities researchers, and it did provide an incentive for those researchers to become familiar with the new practices required to win such research grants. Just as some scientists had criticised the PGSF for its restriction to government priorities, so many humanities researchers saw it as imposing a set of assumptions about research applicable to science but not to the humanities, notably the practice of team and/or programme research. The application forms were also designed on the basis that scientific conceptions of research were normative and consequently highlighted fundamental differences with research practices in the arts and humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">However, in the light of what was to follow, entry of the humanities into the Marsden Fund was the high point of the Academy’s advocacy to the government on behalf of arts and humanities research. Further expansion of the position of the humanities in the research funding system did not occur, and it was clear that there was no possibility at that time that a separate Public Good Fund for Culture and Society would be set up. In his report to the 1996 AGM, the President observed that, while the work on access to research funding could attract new members and more support, “The Academy still depends absolutely on the voluntary energy, commitment and time of its Council members, without which it would by now have ceased to exist. The context in which the Academy has been established, nationally and internationally, is not encouraging to its continuance.”</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.16"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-16"><i>1.7.2 Cultural Computing</i></a></h5>
<p>This discussion paper was also included in the May 1995 Newsletter for discussion at the 1995 Conference. It set out in a series of grouped lists a broad spectrum of issues raised by digital information and communications technologies for arts and humanities research and, more broadly, for many aspects of social and cultural evolution. A position which informed much of the Academy’s thinking about the role of educational and cultural institutions, and the distinctive character of knowledge in the humanities, within the overall conception of the knowledge society was succinctly expressed in the statement, “Information and knowledge are educational, research and creative assets accumulated and developed by past generations and invested for future generations.” Once again, the work done by other national humanities organisations provided the Academy with critical sources enabling it to formulate a relevant set of positions on which to base policy argument. But local expertise, especially from university library personnel who were caught up in the complicated process of adaptation by universities to the new digital technologies, was also very important.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The report anticipated that much of what it identified in point form could become the subject of developed policy papers, although the main outcomes were submissions to government. Another quotation from <i>Humanities and the Arts on the Information Highways</i> prefaced the paper: “Like the Internet, the Humanities and the Arts have as a primary purpose making connections: between events, concepts, disciplines, institutions, and individuals. As a conceptual network, the humanities and the arts encompass multiple styles and perspectives; they interconnect memory and innovation, imagination and interpretation, knowledge and inspiration. The nation can justifiably celebrate the enrichment that the humanities and arts bring to the quality of its individual and community lives, and work with equal enthusiasm to adopt the National Information Infrastructure as an extraordinary opportunity for the sharing, preservation, and enrichment of our cultural heritage” (25).</p>
<p class="noindent1">One idea, the establishment of an Electronic Information Resources Facility for the Humanities which would, among other functions,</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Establish comprehensive access to electronic information resources nationally and internationally in association with other equivaIent centres; and</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Create a substantial information resource on Aotearoa/New Zealand society and culture which would complement that utilising other media) that is easily accessible nationally and internationally,</p>
<p class="noindent1">carries within it the kernel of the idea for what subsequently became the Humanities Research Network. Another, the statement that “Networked information can generate positive synergy; the more people that have access to it, the more people will use it and find new uses for it, thus attracting more users”, can be seen in retrospect to point towards Creative Commons (see below 3.3.5) and to the proposals for open access to government information. And the position on the digitising of items and collections held by cultural institutions raised another set of fundamental issues distinguishing the sciences from the arts and humanities, on the one hand, and the requirements for professional competence in modern humanities research, teaching and publication from those required for effective professional knowledge work in a digital environment, on the other:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Significant initiatives have taken place in relation to the digitising of cultural heritage information but there is no overall plan;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>The benefits of the digitisation of elements of our cultural heritage should not blind us to the need to preserve original materials for they will retain their unique significance and value;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>The digitised image is not a "reasonable facsimile", simply an image pointing to the original;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>A key issue to be adressed is the matter of the ownership of digitised elements of our cultural heritage;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>There is a need for Humanities’ researchers to have a stonger voice in the planning of electronic networked information especially that relating to elements of our cultural heritage since much of the input thus far has been from scientists;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>The digitising of the complex resources of the Arts and Humanities presents special challenges best solved by dialogue between Humanities’ researchers and technologists;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Humanities’ researchers can encourage the development of appropriate new tools and methods of knowledge representation;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Humanities’ researchers may be able to develop standards to ensure that Humanities’ information will retain its quality and authority and remain viable over time.</p>
<p class="noindent1">These points, to do with the nature and ownership of collections, the development of standards for digitising pre-digital objects (the notable example here is the development in a joint collaboration between British and American scholars of the Text Encoding Initiative), the design of techniques and training appropriate to the use of digtised materials in research, teaching and publication which have now come together under the headings of e-research and digital humanities, go to the heart of deep change across the spectrum of professional work in the arts, culture and the humanities. And these changes are the more challenging because what changes is the medium, not only in which this work is carried on but also of the textual objects which are the “raw” materials of research in these fields.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The association with the National Library of New Zealand, the Alexander Turnbull Library, and the Trustees of the National Library, which had developed from the inception of the Academy, brought the Academy up close with the policy work being done by the National Library. For very much the same reasons as the Academy, the National Library had to make a case for being involved in knowledge policy formation at the level of research and innovation, since it was not obvious to government that libraries had anything directly to do with new knowledge creation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At this time, thinking was being informed (and complicated) by much new writing on the social and cultural implications of the new digital technologies. Professor Timothy Luke, Professor of Political Science at Virginia State University and Polytechnic Institute (VirginiaTech) and Director of the Cyberschool, a virtual university development, came to New Zealand in 1995 as a Fulbright scholar on a project on this topic jointly organised by the Department of English and the School of Communications Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. A series of monthly seminars under the rubric, <i>Communications Technologies: What are their Social and Cultural Implications for New Zealand?,</i> began in 1996, was jointly sponsored by the Academy and the Telecommunications Users Association of New Zealand (TUANZ), was held at Victoria University, and was continued for the following two years. The question it explored sought to move discussion away from the strong association of the new technologies with technological determinism, and the one-way relationship between culture, society and technology signified by the term “impact”: How does culture shape communication technologies, how do communication technologies produce new cultural forms? It provided an important bridge between academics, public sector officials and people in the private sector who shared interests in the new information and communication order. It also provided the Academy with significant knowledge about local developments and current thinking, including the work being done by the government on “information superhighway” issues. The Academy made regular submissions on policy discussion papers, and was particularly focussed on their implications for cultural institutions, most notably the National Library, and education. These matters also became a regular aspect of Academy conferences, where the diversity of perspectives characteristic of the “conceptual network” of the arts, culture and the humanities could be recognised.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Any concern with the economic role of knowledge in the “information society” necessarily required a position on the kinds of education and training required for such a society to function effectively. One move in this direction, in an Academy document entitled <i>Key Points in the Formation of Policies to Enhance the Future of the Humanities/Aronui in New Zealand</i> (1996), based an approach to the issue of skills on an amplified definition of literacy, which included:</p>
<p class="slist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the recognition of cultural diversity, not the assertion of monocultural absolutes;</p>
<p class="slist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>a firm grounding in a birth culture and language, the ability to acquire other languages, and an understanding of other cultures;</p>
<p class="slist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>an increasingly sophisticated literacy, which includes qualitative and quantitative modes of analysis and the ability to work with pictorial, graphic and numeric as well as alphabetic representations;</p>
<p class="slist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the ability to analyse information ethically, imaginatively, and historically as well as logically, to articulate values as well as facts;</p>
<p class="slist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>an understanding of the transformations being wrought by new information and communications technology in the ways we think and interact with one another, especially in research, scholarship, and the access to and management of knowledge resources.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This position was influenced by another strand deriving from the United States, the writing across the curriculum movement and its engagement with the new digital writing (and reading) machines, in respect of learning, teaching and research and the lack of investment in computer labs and other infrastructure for academics and students in the arts and humanities. <i>Key Points</i> asked a question which the Academy was never able to address directly, but which made explicit the kinds of issues a professional body would have taken up:</p>
<p class="quote">The general BA has been taken in the western university to be the proper grounding for much professional training. With the onset of the informational society, what is the role of higher education in the humanities/aronui?</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.17"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-17"><i>1.7.3 Implementing research policy – The History of Print Culture in New Zealand (1994-2002)</i></a></h5>
<p>Another development in 1993 turned out to be remarkably timely for the Academy. Professor Don McKenzie, then at Oxford University, a New Zealand Fellow of the British Academy and an editor of the British History of the Book, was back in New Zealand and sought to enlist support for a New Zealand history of the book project. A conference in response to his advocacy which took place at the University of Auckland in 1995 was the first public event in what became a national research project, the History of Print Culture in New Zealand. From the perspective of the Academy, as discussions developed during 1994, such a project offered an ideal opportunity to apply its research policy in a demonstration of the ability of researchers in the arts and humanities to undertake significant collaborative research at a national level without compromising the independence of individual researchers.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Planning the project was accomplished at meetings among people with scholarly interests in the field, including from universities, libraries, printing, publishing and bookselling. A project group was set up to explore options and it was decided that scoping a full-scale history could not be undertaken until what was currently known in the field had been surveyed. This work resulted in <i>Book &amp; Print in New Zealand: A guide to print culture in Aotearoa</i>, Penny Griffith, Ross Harvey &amp; Keith Maslen (eds), (Wellington: Victoria University Press, 1997). This book was funded by grants from the Trustees of the National Library and comprised survey essays on the principal dimensions of print culture in New Zealand, together with a very substantial bibliography. It achieved its intended purpose of defining the scope of the field of enquiry and enabling the setting of priorities for new research. It also became the first e-book published by Victoria University Press with the Electronic Text Centre at the university and, by that means, became a much more widely accessed resource.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Initial planning was based on the Academy’s Object 3, to facilitate research, and the requirements for making successful applications to the PGSF were investigated. Funding was, as usual, a major issue, and an application (unsuccessful) was made to have it funded as a Year 2000 project. In the event, with the creation of the Humanities Panel in the Marsden Fund, that became the focus for planning project applications. A Steering Committee convened by the President of the Academy, based in Wellington (but with members in Auckland, Hamilton, Wanganui and Dunedin), and an Advisory Board, were established. The Print Culture programme received grants for projects from the Marsden Fund in its first two years (mostly for projects carried out by independent scholars), but it was not subsequently successful. While it was very productive of research outcomes, it did not achieve recognition as a model for collaborative research at a national level from most academic humanities researchers with interests in the field. Besides traditional conceptions of research, new disincentives for participation came from the increasingly competitive emphasis among universities on success in the research funding rounds and the lack of interest in collaborations beyond the borders of each institution and academic unit.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A brief summary of the programme can be found in an introduction to the <i>Turnbull Library Record 2001</i>: a special “Print Culture in New Zealand” issue, where it was noted that “Important partnerships have been established that provide a support and continuity that is essential for what is a largely voluntary effort: in particular the Turnbull Library has provided administrative help and a meeting place for the Committee, as well as specific assistance in kind for seminars and conferences, and as contractor for research projects conducted under the print culture umbrella. The financial management services provided by the Alexander Turnbull Library Research Endowment Trust have enabled us to take on the responsibility of research grant funds and projects.” Over about 8 years, the programme produced 7 monographs, it organised 7 conferences and seminars in various parts of the country, and it was successful in gaining funding from the Marsden Fund for 5 research projects, all of which resulted in publications.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Little of the research work could have been completed, or even begun, without Marsden funding. Applications at the very beginning of the Marsden Fund’s operation provided valuable experience in what was required of humanities’ researchers to succeed in competitive national funding rounds, and also assisted the Fund managers in getting to grips with the difference of humanities from scientific research. But three other factors were also important:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Work on the first publication, <i>Book &amp; Print in New Zealand</i>, provided all applicants with a strong basis for linking their specific research projects into the survey by building on it and so expanding the scope of what was known about the introduction of printing and publishing into New Zealand. It was specifically hoped that, because colonisation had brought printing and print literacy into contact with Māori oral culture relatively recently, research into that contact might produce valuable new knowledge of relevance to the study of the history of the book beyond New Zealand.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Applications under the Academy’s auspices would not have been successful without the Turnbull Library’s and the Endowment Trust’s involvement. Not only did the participation of the principal national humanities research library link the research programme directly into the national collections, but the ability of the Endowment Trust to act as fund manager for the projects got over the problem that the Academy by itself lacked the ability to guarantee to the Marsden Fund’s managers’ satisfaction the security and proper oversight of the funds. Looked at from another angle, this outcome was of great importance in showing how a national research programme in the humanities could be conducted by means appropriate to the humanities and could directly involve the expertise of the library professionals managing the relevant national collections. If this demonstration appeared to offer an anlogy with the Crown Research Institutes for science and technology, it could have no purchase on government policy. National and regional cultural institutions, their collections and their concentrations of professional expertise were not conceived to be integral components of the nation’s research capability. A proposal was made to the National Library for the establishment of a Centre for Research in Print Culture with the capability of directly linking researchers, funding, a national research programme, and the fundamental collections and expertise of the Turnbull Library, but without success.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>The third factor was the international context of the research programme, which added the essential dimension of an international reference group. Conversations were opened up with scholars working in other national projects: the History of the Book in Australia, the British History of the Book, the History of the Book in Scotland, the History of the Irish Book, the History of the Book in American Culture, the History of Print Culture in the United States, and the History of the Book in Canada. Some of these scholars participated in conferences in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It seems fitting that, near the end of the programme brought about by the failure to gain new research funding, the final conference was commemorative. The July 2001 conference, <i>Remembering Don McKenzie</i>, financially supported by the Friends of the Turnbull Library, was a major international conference marking the contribution to the field made by New Zealand’s most distinguished book historian.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s1.18"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-18">2. Standing Back and then Going Forward: 1997 to the century’s end</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The Research and Cultural Computing policy papers established the intellectual foundations for programme development, partnership planning, and working relations with other organisations, and continued to have this function throughout the life of the Academy as an incorporated society. But by the mid 1990s, meetings with the other national humanities bodies, whether academies, research councils or federations, demonstrated that the inclusion of the term “Academy” in the name of the New Zealand organisation was misleading, since it did not perform the traditional academy function of electing Fellows. At the AGM in 1997 it was agreed to replace “Academy” with “Society”, and the new name became The Humanities Society of New Zealand/Te Whāinga Aronui.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The paper making the case also served as an assessment of the direction being taken by the Council to develop the Society. It surveyed developments with respect to national organisations representing knowledge in New Zealand and overseas, affirmed that what was increasingly being called HUMANZ (from the title of the Newsletter) was evolving as a unique kind of organisation and that its Strategic Plan and Objects were appropriate. It noted that other academy-type organisations were developing a think tank function, enabling them to make research-based representations to their governments either alone or in collaborations on matters of common concern. The Royal Society of New Zealand had moved the Fellows of its Academy from their central position in governance. Its range of functions, and the services purchased from it by the government, described the terms of the case the Council had determined to make to the government for the Humanities Society and further supported changing the name. But the Council was not, therefore, walking away from its final Object, which required it to offer recognition to those with distinguished achievements in the humanities. The question was more, how could this best be done?</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is worth quoting one section from this paper, which summarised the Council’s understanding of the scope of the work the Society had undertaken in some way and its main themes:</p>
<p class="quote">There are 5 main dimensions of the sphere of activity which the past four years have shown is available to and required of HUMANZ if it is to become a strong national public organisation with a secured reputation as THE voice for the humanities/aronui. These are:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>relation to governmen</i>t:<br />policy advice and policy formation in all areas to do with the production, transmission and conservation of cultural knowledge in New Zealand; contribution to improvement of relations with other countries through exchanges and meetings;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>relation to learning</i>:<br />the recognition of excellence and achievement in all domains in which cultural knowledge is the basis of expertise and qualification; the creation of awards and prizes; the stimulation and funding of research and publication; the organisation of conferences, seminars and other public meetings; facilitating the movement of experts between New Zealand and other countries; encouraging new programme development;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>relation to society</i>:<br />the dissemination of advanced work in the humanities/aronui to the public of New Zealand;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>relation to employment</i>:<br />the formation of clear and appropriate professional standards and expectations for work in the humanities/aronui in New Zealand; defining appropriate frameworks for education and certification; engaging with issues of professional significance eg copyright; providing opportunities for professional development; improving the means of communication amongst knowledge workers in the humanities/aronui; research on, and interventions in, the market for the range of qualifications in humanities/aronui;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>relation to other organisations nationally and internationally</i>:<br />collaborative work on shared issues and policies; the support of exchanges and fellowships for further education and training in cultural knowledge and cultural relations; the creation of endowments for these activities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The paper closed with the optimistic affirmation that the Humanities Society had proved itself to be a “necessary organisation which must now assume its proper place nationally and internationally as a strong and very well informed voice for the humanities/aronui.”</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.19"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-19">2.1 Designing a Logo and Creating a Website</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Further steps in consolidating the identity of the Society and locating it in the new communicational space opened up by the World Wide Web were taken at this time.</p>

<div class="logo-border" id="fig1.2">
	<h2 class="chapname">HUMANZ <br />The  Logo</h2>

	</div>
	<p class="imagecaption" style="text-align: center;">Illustration 1</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent1">The design of the Academy logo followed the same understandings as the process of consultation leading to the gifting of the name Te Whāinga Aronui. After various discussions, a meeting with the artist John Bevan Ford (Ngati Raukawa ki Kapiti) led to his proposing a visualisation of the term humanities/aronui based on a conception of the ancient origins of the peoples inhabiting Aotearoa New Zealand and the journeys taken to this distant land (<a href="#fig1.1">Illustration 1</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent1">The design was accompanied by the following explanatory text:</p>
<p class="quote">The two components of the logo are a palm tree from a Cretan vase from about 1900 BC and a hei or Māori fish hook amulet from early North Island New Zealand. They combine to represent the partnership between Māori and Pākehā which, in our history, is symbolised by the
Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p class="quote">These images also refer to the natural world which sustains us. By suggesting how the land and sea of New Zealand have become caught up in the global flow of cultures, they signify continuing cultural change.</p>
<p class="quote">The fish hook is a reminder of the Polynesian cultural innovator Maui who by “fishing up” the islands of the Pacific created a pathway from Asia to the Pacific just as, together with the palm, it also suggests the ships which linked Europe to New Zealand.</p>
<p class="quote">The Cretan palm is a reminder of the invention of writing, specifically the development of syllabic script at Phaestus in the same period.</p>
<p class="quote">Language, spoken and written, is the foundation of the humanities/aronui as the gathering together of cultural knowledge. Our
logo images the arts and humanities endlessly interacting with each other, creating and interpreting our cultures.
</p>
<p class="noindent1">Ford’s design concept was warmly endorsed by the Council, and his gift of the logo to the Academy was acknowledged with gratitude at its 1996 AGM. He became the first Honorary Member of the Academy in recognition of his
contribution to its development.</p>
 <p class="noindent1">Additional design work was done by Mark McGuire, School of Design, University of Otago. This design (<a href="#fig1.2">Illustration 2</a>) is one example of a larger design process carried out for the Society which emphasised the aesthetic qualities of the material means by which the Society presented itself in its communications.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Quite beautiful design work was done by Sarah Laing for both paper and web documents, and part of the sadness associated with the demise of HUMANZ is the loss of these visual representations of the values and purposes of the Society at the various stages of its evolution.

<p class="noindent1">The Society’s website followed the Newsletter as a further attempt to broaden understanding of the
Society’s work by amplifying its “voice”, and to encourage membership and participation in the
Society’s conferences and policy work.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The website was created in 1997 with the address:
<a href="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/humanz/">http://www.vuw.ac.nz/humanz/</a>. It was developed and maintained by a graduate student, Brendan
Mosely, and it was initially hosted by Victoria University of Wellington, becoming <a href="http://www.humanz.org.nz">www.humanz.org.nz</a> when it moved off the university’s servers. The site was intended to be a central component in the Council’s strategy to improve its
means of communication with members and non-members of the Society, but it served principally as a publicly accessible archive of the Society’s on-going work in document form.</p>


<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.20"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-20">2.2 Implementing policy – Cultural Foresight and the Knowledge Policy Research Group</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">A critical issue for everyone involved in trying to advance the interests of the humanities was not just learning how to deal with government, both Ministers and Ministries, but was working out <u>who</u> to deal with. As a field of enquiry and the creator of significant knowledge, the humanities were nonetheless invisible to government. It was clear that the sciences (and RSNZ) linked to government through the new policy Ministry of Research, Science and Technology. But what did the comma signify: that the Ministry was in principle responsible for all research policy, but primarily for science and technology; or that the comma was in effect a colon, and the Ministry was responsible only for research in science and technology? This problem was never resolved, although the means were offered in a report commissioned by the government in 2005 (which will be discussed below).</p>
<p class="noindent1">It seemed obvious that the proper channel would be the Ministry of Cultural Affairs (MCA), the policy ministry for creative and performing arts and cultural heritage. Between MRST and MCA, the whole spectrum of knowledge creation (at least of western knowledge) was included. From another angle, if the principal means of applying scientific knowledge to society was through industry, then the principal means of applying humanities knowledge to society was through education. Neither MRST nor the Ministry of Education (MoE) recognised an immediate connection between the humanities and their primary areas of responsibility, although MCA participated in Academy and then Society conferences from the beginning. At this time, the brief of MoE excluded the universities; if MCA had included from its inception, as had been intended, the Historical Publications Branch of the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), it would have had a traditional humanities component (see <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a>). During the 1990s MRST assumed leadership in knowledge policy and its role expanded considerably; by contrast, MCA was lowly ranked, its areas of responsibility were not seen as integral to economic policy, and the cultural agencies which it funded seemed quite independent of it. During the 1990s, the most continuous and substantial support for the work of the Academy came from the Trustees of the National Library, the British Council and the Australian High Commission, and Fulbright New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">An Australian initiative in knowledge and research policy provided a valuable context for interventions in knowledge policy and programme development in New Zealand. The National Scholarly Communications Forum (NSCF), founded in 1994, sponsored by Australia’s four Learned Academies, involves researchers, librarians, publishers, and specialists in information technology and copyright and was set up to investigate the implications of a global knowledge system for research and its dissemination, ownership of the results of research, and access to those results in a small nation. Research was commissioned which led to the publication of a report by John Houghton,<i>The Economics of Scholarly Communication</i>(2001) which concluded that, in respect of academic research, a country like Australia paid twice for knowledge, once for its production and then a second time when the published research was bought from international publishers who owned the journals. By bringing together representatives of the range of agencies and interests in the research system (including cultural institutions), the NSCF provided a highly effective model for enquiry into current issues raised by governments’ emphasis on the relation between research, innovation, and economic development, and for making recommendations on government policy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The papers from the Forum in 1993 which led to the foundation of the NSCF in 1994 were published in 1993 by the Australian Academy of the Humanities in <i>Changes in Scholarly Communication Patterns – Australia and the Electronic Library</i>, edited by John Mulvaney and Colin Steele. Its most recent Roundtable, 23, was held in 2013 on “Open Access in Research: Issues in the Humanities and Social Sciences”. The Forum is exemplary of the thoughtful public work on behalf of research and publication in the arts, culture and the humanities to which the Society gained access through the Australian Academy and which it sought to accomplish in New Zealand. During the past two decades the AAH has directly confronted in its Symposia and in representations to the Australian government the implications of the profound shifts in public policy and corporate action which together led to the increasing marginalising of the humanities as a relevant domain of public knowledge and expertise, and the defensive inward turn in academic humanists’ thinking. A full review of its Symposia publications, reports and submissions on the AAH website will make the grounds for this high estimation very clear.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In New Zealand, discussions about public policies for knowledge were led by MRST in the late 1990s under the banner of Foresight (see <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter Three</a>). The aim, a consistent feature of MRST’s understanding of its public role, was to bring together the various components of knowledge-based production – research institutes, businesses, and government agencies – and, with the assistance of papers, speakers, and workshops, to generate thinking about the shape(s) of the (knowledge) future for New Zealand and so achieve more effective policy and planning. Since the overarching banner for the Foresight project was <i>Building Tomorrow’s Success</i>, it might have been expected that the cultural agencies and producers might have been involved – but the programme assumed that science and technology in association with business provided the knowledge that mattered.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Society’s Knowledge Policy Research Group (KPRG) first came together towards the end of 1997 with the aim of shifting the debate about the knowledge society towards a more inclusive conception of knowledge than that represented by science and technology alone. It became the organisational and developmental core of the Society’s activities in the area of knowledge policy, and its work was sponsored by a grant from The Trustees of the National Library.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The KPRG also attempted to deal with what appeared to be a fundamental problem concerning the term humanities. It was hardly ever used in the media, not all universities used it in the names of their administrative units, and it seemed to have no place in official discourse. The phrase “science and technology” had, by contrast, achieved popular as well as official recognition as the shorthand term for knowledge, especially new knowledge. The question was, could a term be found which could achieve the same generality as “science and technology”, but with meanings that made it a true description of the kinds of knowledge characteristic of the arts, culture and the humanities in both principal knowledge traditions in Aotearoa New Zealand, and consistent with the account given in the Research Policy. The KPRG settled on the term cultural knowledge and gave it a working definition:</p>
<p class="quote">Cultural knowledge is understood to refer to a nation’s whole stock of knowledge (including science and technology), as that knowledge is shaped by values, beliefs and traditions, as well as the knowledge created by artists and by people in the ordinary processes of social living.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This conception remains true to what is probably better termed humanistic knowledge even if the Society lacked the discursive power to impose “cultural knowledge” on the government or the media. Its principal affirmations, which give it value and power, are that science and technology are a part of a culture’s stock of knowledge and not independent of it, and that a culture’s people are all contributors to the common stock of that culture’s knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Society initiated discussions with the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and organised seminars with the aim of building a case for the inclusion of the cultural sector in the Foresight process. The two seminars which took place in 1998 under the title, <i>Cultural Knowledge and the Shaping of the Future, I and II</i>,<i>w</i>ere billed as components in the Society’s <i>Research Project towards the Formation of a National Knowledge Policy</i>, the aims of which were defined as:</p>
<p class="quote">To provide the best and most current account of the terms on which a national knowledge policy for New Zealand should be formulated, from the perspective of cultural knowledge and its role in society and the economy.</p>
<p class="quote">The interactions and differences between the two principal knowledge traditions in New Zealand, Māori and European, largely constitute the distinctive basis on which New Zealand now engages and will in the future engage with global flows of information for the purposes of cultural and economic development.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Their immediate purpose was to engage cultural organisations in the Foresight process by discussing issues it raised for the cultural sector. In the letter of invitation sent to state sector Chief Executives and a broad spectrum of related organisations, the Society stated that</p>
<p class="quote">We believe that it is necessary, and urgent, for organisations and individuals in the cultural field to accept MoRST's encouragement to formulate alternative perspectives on how to think about the future. To that end HUMANZ, as a national organisation committed to promoting a greater recognition of the contribution that humanistic, social scientific and cultural knowledge can make to the development of public policy, has decided to organise a seminar on ‘Cultural Knowledge and the Shaping of the Future’.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The keynote speaker for the first seminar was the Fulbright scholar, Professor Timothy Luke, on ‘Thinking into the Future, Culturally’. This theme was continued through the day, with a paper prepared by the KPRG, a session on Māori knowledge and the future, and a session on science fiction, addressed by two New Zealand science fiction writers, Stephanie Johnson and Phillip Mann. The second seminar extended the discussion of the significance of culture in knowledge policy to radio, film and digital technologies, Māori media, new media and nationhood.</p>
<p class="noindent1">During this year the KPRG joined public sector officials in the Cultural Foresight Group, which was made up of representatives of a number of government departments and non-governmental interests, including the Department of Internal Affairs, Radio New Zealand, Te Mangai Paho, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Creative New Zealand, the Hillary Commission, Te Puni Kokiri, the National Library, and the Historic Places Trust. This group provided the context in the cultural sector from which the members of the KPRG participated in the larger Foresight meetings and planned the third seminar in 1999, <i>Seizing the Future - Cultural Value in the Knowledge Economy,</i> which was sponsored by McCabe and Company, Intellectual Property Lawyers and Patent Attorneys. One of its members, Dr Derek Wallace, wrote a substantial background paper, <i>Notes on Cultural Capital in a Knowledge-Based Society,</i> which was provided to seminar participants.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The brief for the seminar was:</p>
<p class="quote">As New Zealand moves forward into the post-industrial age of the new century, economic transactions that are based on the production and consumption of material goods are being added to and enhanced by economic relationships based on the exchange of information and knowledge. In this kind of economy, access to information and the way some information is privileged and therefore promoted above others will be defining characteristics of our economy and our society.</p>
<p class="quote">‘Culture’ and cultural issues become increasingly important in this new economic and social order. Here, an individual’s cultural wealth or capital, (derived from their family and societal up bringing, from their education and from the media) will have a significant bearing on how they are able to provide and access information and therefore economic wealth. It will affect the degree to which they are able to participate in public and commercial life. Similarly, a community’s or nation’s cultural wealth or capital, (drawn from their shared understandings, history, rites and rituals, arts and recreational life and icons) will enable it to achieve a distinctiveness which can be drawn on to create interest and competitive advantage in global markets. This ‘capital’ also contributes to the creation of viable business opportunities within internal markets and has the added benefit of enriching the life of the inhabitants of the community and the nation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The seminar was opened by the then Minister of Cultural Affairs, Hon Marie Hasler, who observed that</p>
<p class="quote">We are routinely told that we live in an information age, but little thinking has been done in New Zealand at least about what this really means in broader cultural terms. This seminar provides an opportunity to analyse the phenomenon as it unfolds, and to influence its development, rather than waiting to gaze back ruefully later on. Now more than ever, poised as we are on the brink of a new millenium, we need to ask questions of ourselves.</p>
<p class="noindent1">She concluded her address with the following comment:</p>
<p class="quote">Fittingly, the Cultural Foresight group was initiated by the Humanities Association of Aotearoa, New Zealand, HUMANZ and Creative New Zealand, in response to the Ministry of Research, Science, and Technology’s call to develop outcomes to guide the government’s investment in scientific and technological research. I appreciate the work that your group has done to develop cultural sector submissions to this project and acknowledge the discernible influence you’ve had on the set of draft outcomes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It was uncommon to hear public endorsement from government Ministers of the work being done by the Society (which is one reason for quoting it here). But these comments were encouraging, and did have an influence on the decisions made about how to build on this work, with a national election to occur towards the end of the year.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This project proved to be of great interest to those involved but it could not be carried on by the Cultural Foresight Group itself because to do so would have exceeded the mandates of the public sector officials who made up the greater part of its membership. This experience was extremely valuable for the Society because it demonstrated conclusively the limits on public sector agencies in contrast to independent advocacy organisations in respect of their role in working for the public interest. It provided a clear justification for the claim being made by the Society to have a role in the policy field.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The papers given and the discussions stimulated by them at the third seminar were recorded, transcribed and published as <i>Seizing The Future – Cultural Value in the Knowledge Economy. Cultural Foresight, Seminar Three, Turnbull House 9.3.99,</i> facilitated by Ian Fraser and edited by Louise O’Brien. This was one of the few occasions when a publishing intention was fully carried through. Most of the HUMANZ conferences and seminars were audio recorded and the tapes transcribed, but the pressure of new work and deadlines meant that the final and time-consuming work of formal publication was not usually achieved.<sup><a id="note_6" href="#note6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Another example is the concept developed in detail in 1998 for a serial publication, speculatively bi- or multi-lingual in its contents, called <i>Cultural Knowledge</i> (there were apparently no competitors, local or international, for that title at the time). It was specifically designed to publicise the term cultural knowledge, to develop an account over time of the implications of the working definition, and to provide a medium for communication and dissemination of ideas to the broad constituency invoked by the definition. <i>Media Information Australia</i> was seen to provide an attractive model for such a journal, but neither time nor an obvious source of funding could then be found for its development.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the blog format had been available then, perhaps that would have solved the problem. But in 2007 a new opportunity was offered when the Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network (KAREN) sought applications for development projects under its terms of reference. It was considered that advancing the concept of <i>Cultural Knowledge</i> as an e-journal through an application for funding to KAREN would add a valuable new capability. The application was made but was not successful.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.21"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-21"><i>2.2.1 A Reflection</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">Cultural Foresight was a very important and testing experience for those involved in it, because it showed the value and importance of having a diverse group of professionally trained people in the cultural sector working together on open-ended issues of general significance. The Society devised programmes for its annual conferences which adopted a similar approach and which were based on creating exchange across sectors and engaging different kinds of expertise through inviting speakers and composing topic-oriented panels. Taken together, these meetings were intended to sketch over time the scope of the cultural field and the diversity of issues being raised by intellectual, technological and policy changes. They were also intended to discover and demonstrate what the core work of the Society as an interface organisation locating itself among the various already existing organisations making up the cultural sector should be. It was evident early in this process that such an approach was consistent with the way in which public servants understood their work, but it did not so readily complement academic work.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The perspective of those in academic institutions whose concern was the institution as a whole and its relations with society was similar; the difference was evident in the situation of disciplinary academics, for whom conference attendance and funding were defined in discipline terms. Although the Society’s conferences aimed to tackle questions of immediate importance to academic researchers in the wider context of their institutions and changes being wrought by government policies, they were not perceived to be of immediate relevance to most academics. Clearly, it was not the task of the Society to emulate disciplinary meetings; its areas of proper concern with direct academic relevance were, for example, the large national issues of research funding and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One aspect of infrastructure had become apparent from the start, in the matter of institutional membership. A couple of university Deans had made their faculties members, but what stood out in comparison to the RSNZ was the almost complete lack of professional associations in the humanities, and the underdevelopment of learned societies. The latter was the more immediately important because learned societies are critical components of research infrastructure through their provision of scholarly publication and conferences. The strongest learned society in the humanities was the New Zealand Historical Association, which included school teachers of history and public historians as well as academics; in this it brought within itself the diversity of ways of being an historian in Aotearoa New Zealand, as much as the Humanities Society was attempting to represent the diversity in the field of humanistic knowledge, in both the creation of that knowledge and its social and cultural applications. But even the Historical Association depended on voluntary service for its continuing operation; and it was an associate member of RSNZ, History being recognised as a social science. It was clearly not possible for such associations in New Zealand either to find sufficient members or to charge sufficiently high fees (exactly the problem encountered by the Society) to enable them to employ staff or expand the scope of their representational activity, for example, in research into policy developments relevant to their members. It was (and is) also the case that the larger learned societies are Australasian in structure and membership, and are linked into Australian more than New Zealand relationships, for example, by the Council for Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. While there is much in common between the two countries, government agendas and processes are not in step and representational work on behalf of the disciplines tended more usually to be responsive to Australian imperatives. Besides the difference in scale between Australian and New Zealand institutions, the Australian Federal Government was typically well ahead in policy formation and the creation of knowledge about Australia.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.22"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-22">2.3 A major collaboration</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">In the midst of these meetings, planning programmes and the preparation of papers a major cultural studies conference took place in Wellington between 10-12 July 1998.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>Culture Shocks. The Future of Culture/Global Spaces, Pacific Places</i> was the first national Cultural Studies conference in New Zealand, organised by Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand, Museums Aotearoa, the NZ-US Educational Foundation, Victoria University of Wellington, and the Humanities Society. Over 200 people participated in wide-ranging discussions about culture, media, and institutions. Although HUMANZ could not be a major participant financially, a considerable contibution was made to planning the programme and selecting speakers. The Society did, however, with assistance from the Australian High Commission, support and arrange the participation of Professor Meaghan Morris, of the University of Technology, Sydney, a public intellectual and an internationally respected writer and speaker on cultural and political issues. This conference was an excellent example of how research and development in the humanities could be focussed at a national level and by linking institutions whose collaboration opened up new spaces for intellectual enquiry.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.23"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-23">2.4 At last, a commission</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">An important outcome of the Cultural Foresight intervention was an invitation from MRST to submit a project proposal on matters raised by the project, in the context of MRST’s developing interest in the issue of creativity in the arts and sciences, and its role in innovation. This was the first opportunity the Society had found to engage in funded development work of the kind anticipated in its first strategic plan. To do the work, the KPRG was expanded to include people who were very interested in these issues, who had participated in one or more of the Society’s Foresight seminars, and who were prepared to volunteer themselves to contribute to the research needed for the project report and to work as a reference group.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Once again, this was an important precedent setting process for the Society. The report demonstrated that it could produce a text which was able to engage a wide range of current research work in arts, humanities and social sciences relevant to New Zealand’s specific situation. Throughout the 1990s, organisations like the Business Roundtable were downloading into New Zealand knowledge and argument about development for New Zealand which were accounts of practices and models developed in and relevant to societies and economies hugely different from New Zealand in economic and organisational scale, to say nothing of differences in history, culture and values. The aim of the Knowledge Policy Research Group was to explore these models and the research on which they were based, but to assess it critically in the very different context provided by New Zealand. The final report, <i>Knowledge, Creativity and Innovation: Developing a knowledge society for a small, democratic country</i> (September 2000), was authored by three members of the KPRG, Louise O’Brien, Brian Opie and Derek Wallace; it established for the Society a firm grasp on the key issues and relations between them which were a product of adopting a humanities perspective on these policy questions and which provided the grounds for further interventions into government thinking and policy formation.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.24"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-24">2.5 DICE – Directions in Information, Culture and Economy</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The culmination of what could be called the second development phase of the Society was accomplished in the Forum and Seminar presented early in 2000 under the banner of DICE – Directions in Information, Culture and Economy. A new Labour government was elected in late 1999 with a strong commitment to stepping up the emphasis in policy and funding on research and innovation, including the creative industries as a key component, and dealing with the financial problems of national cultural institutions. The Society concluded that it had to attract this government’s attention if it were to secure its development. After seven years, the Society had not achieved the financial base it needed to increase the range of its work and to build its public profile; in fact, membership was declining in part because the Society depended on voluntary contributions of time and energy to accomplish anything at all and had not been able to offer services to members which could secure their on-going support. Gaining entry for the humanities to the Marsden Research Fund was the single notable achievement in this respect, and the means by which that had been accomplished – and credit for the accomplishment - were quickly forgotten in the universities. It was also obvious that the RSNZ, during the same period, had been granted more than $1m a year to provide for the sciences the services that the Society sought to provide for the humanities. The gap was only growing greater, year by year, between the substantial public investment in the support of the sciences and the nation’s techno-scientific infrastructure, and the negligible investment in the humanities. The case for funding from government seemed incontrovertible – except that it was also apparent that no-one in government seemed to be aware that the deficiency existed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">DICE sought to foreground two main lines of approach to key issues in knowledge and innovation policy, the role of culture and the importance of public institutions. The DICE Forum, under the rubric, <i>Developing a National Research Information Infrastructure</i>, was held in the Library at Victoria University of Wellington on 17 February 2000 and was opened by The Hon Steve Maharey, Associate Minister for Tertiary Education. Its purpose was</p>
<p class="quote">to bring together representatives of the principal agencies and institutions active in the creation, dissemination and conservation of knowledge in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="quote">This forum will consider the value of adopting the model provided by the Australian Coalition on Innovations in Scholarly Communication. It will place particular emphasis on the distinctive characteristics of cultural knowledge and the institutions now needed by a small nation in a global information environment.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Forum discussions were introduced by Colin Steele, University Librarian at the Australian National University, on the topic “Coalitions for Knowledge. Australian and International Perspectives”, recognising the work done by the coalition of research libraries, the National Library of Australia, and other cultural institutions to open up consideration of the role of public institututions in the evolution of the knowledge society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The DICE Seminar, held at Victoria University of Wellington’s School of Architecture the following day, under the rubric <i>Directions in Information, Culture and Economy</i>, was opened by the Hon Marian Hobbs, Minister responsible for the National Library and National Archives. It was designed to</p>
<p class="quote">demonstrate the complex work of cultural institutions in twenty-first century societies of the kind New Zealand aspires to be. It is a key component in an ensemble of meetings aimed at providing the basis for an integrated policy towards cultural knowledge in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="quote">International developments in thinking about the relations between cultural and economic development, between libraries, the knowledge economy, and the informed citizen, and between cultural vitality and the future of cities have powerful implications for government policies in the domains of information, culture, and the economy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The keynote speaker for the Seminar was Charles Landry, of Comedia in the United Kingdom, a leading thinker and practitioner concerning the role of culture and the arts in the renewal of cities in the postindustrial evolution of Europe. His address on “Rethinking culture and cultural institutions for a knowledge society” was responded to by Dame Cheryl Sotheran, Chief Executive, Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand. The remainder of the seminar comprised three panels: Maintaining and creating cultural knowledge; The library as a cultural institution; and Cultural institutions, communications networks, innovation and the knowledge economy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Charles Landry also gave a public lecture during the evening between the Forum and the Seminar, <i>Putting creativity centre stage - responding to global transformation.</i> He repeated this lecture in Christchurch and Auckland; it was expected of international visitors that their travel should where possible include other university cities so that people resident outside the capital could also hear them and learn something more about the HUMANZ programme at the same time.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.25"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-25">2.6 Making the Case to Government</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Following the participation of the two Ministers in DICE the Society resolved to seek recognition from the government. Having opened a new institutional space “next to” the Royal Society of New Zealand (as the only national and non-governmental organisation established to represent the interests of knowledge as such) with the aim of providing complementary services to the government and its sector, the Society presented a case to the government in these terms. The President and the Treasurer attended a meeting about the future of HUMANZ with Hon Steve Maharey, Minister of Education (Tertiary), the Hon Judith Tizard, Minister for Culture and Heritage, and the Hon Pete Hodgson, Minister for Research, Science and Technology, on 16 November 2000. The meeting had considerable symbolic significance, because the three Ministers represented a large part of the knowledge spectrum which the Society was attempting to think together. A meeting had occurred previously with the Hon Marian Hobbs, whose ministerial responsibilities for the National Library, National Archives and public broadcasting gathered together the other principal components of the spectrum. The obvious absence was that of the Minister of Maori Affairs.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Minister for RS&amp;T became the lead minister for an investigation into the need for national representation for the humanities, research being the key term. The three Ministries provided officials for a committee to manage the investigation, and funding for the appointment of a consultant to prepare a business plan with the Society. The spread of Ministries was itself an eloquent testimony to the range of ways in which the humanities could interact with government, and to the lack of any prior decision about which Ministry might have the prime interest in the work of the humanities. However, during the development of the plan the Ministry of Education official withdrew because of a lack of fit with the Ministry’s priorities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The writing of the business plan was a valuable learning experience for the Council, even though it absorbed most of the Council members’ time and energy<sup><a id="note_7" href="#note7">7</a></sup> for several months in 2001. Helpful commentary on the first draft of the plan was provided by members of the officials’ committee, and the final version, <i>Five Year Strategic Plan: A Report to the Ministries of Culture and Heritage, Education, and Research, Science and Technology</i> (31 August 2001), was regarded as providing a very strong basis for the future development of the Society. In the event, the government response was that an organisation to do the work defined in the plan was needed, there was no other organisation proposing to do this work, and the plan was a good plan which the government could support. But another test was required. The question that was asked was, Is the Society recognised by its sector as representing it? Specifically, did the universities support it?</p>
<p class="noindent1">Accomplishing this work had been a major commitment, and this response provided a fundamental challenge to the ongoing commitment of Council members. Given that membership was continuing to decline, that the universities (with some notable exceptions) had shown little interest since the initial meeting of the Deans in 1991, and that the Society had little money in reserve to support further efforts, there was a clear case for deciding that the task was too hard. After all, the business plan proposed a budget of only about $300.000 a year, some of which would depend on success in gaining project funding; while a major increase on current income and expenditure, it was not going to make up for decades of under-investment nor facilitate major programmes to change thinking quickly in government and among researchers about the importance of the humanities to government and society in the digital era. Since there had been complete disclosure of the Society’s affairs to officials during the work on the plan, it was disappointing that no funding was made available to assist the Council to meet the further requirements.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.26">2.7 The Humanities Research Network Te Whatunga Rangahau Aronui.</h4>
<p class="noindent1">Two factors decided the immediate strategy of the Council: firstly, the business plan was a real asset, perhaps the only asset the Society had, and it was worth making as much use of it as possible; and secondly, if the Society were to fail to survive, it should make a purposeful use on behalf of the sector of its remaining financial reserves. The Humanities Research Network <i>Linking minds and energies in the arts, culture and the humanities</i> (HRN) began as a project proposed in an appendix to the Five-Year Strategic Plan to illustrate the kinds of work of national significance that a financially stronger Society would undertake, and the initial conception was developed by a group representing the Ministry for Culture and Heritage (Dr Jock Phillips and Dr Claudia Orange), Te Papa (Ian Wedde), the National and Turnbull Libraries (Margaret Calder), the Stout Centre for New Zealand Studies (Dr Lydia Wevers), and the Society (Dr Brian Opie). It was central to the conception of the HRN that it would provide a virtual infrastructure enabling individual researchers, cultural institutions and other organisations in the sector to identify each other, exchange information about events and interests, and collaborate on research. Because knowledge creation in the sector occurs in many locations other than universities, it was decided that registrations would be open to any person with professional (tertiary) qualifications or their equivalent in the arts, humanities/aronui, law, social sciences etc., who engaged in knowledge work (the creation of cultural knowledge) in the modes characteristic of the humanities/aronui. It was apparent that creating a common point of information exchange would mean that the benefits of the funding invested by universities and other organisations from time to time in visitors, seminars, conferences and so on could be much more widely spread if timely knowledge about them were to be available. The concept included a Forum function, intended both to assist and encourage the on-line discussion of issues in the sector and the development of policy papers, and facilitate collaborative research and writing among researchers in different parts of the country or overseas. The large aim was to create for the first time an inclusive representation of knowledge work in the sector which would demonstrate its diversity, richness and capability, and to provide the kind of web-based facility which would bring the sector within the government’s planning horizon for ICT development and improvements in research capability. Government planning did not, of course, typically consider the humanities to be a crucial component of the national knowledge system.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The HRN was, therefore, designed to encourage new ways of thinking about the overlapping domains of knowledge which are represented by the arts, humanities, social sciences, other related fields like law, and mātauranga Māori, and new relationships among their practitioners. It was intended to support the creation of cultural knowledge as a broadly based, multi-professional and multi-organisational practice. In other words, it would aim to provide a representation in a digital environment of the humanities-aronui in all its dimensions, from cultural archive to cultural production in many different organisational and professional settings, and in a variety of languages and media. It was also conceived as a dynamic network and not a static database, linking people to each other and to a broad spectrum of current information relevant to the humanities and related fields and specifically designed to provide content in English and Māori. One major issue was the development of a classificatory schema allowing registrants to self-identify by selecting from a range of categories. After quite a search, a modified version of the fields and sub-fields used by the United Kingdom’s Arts and Humanities Research Board, paying particular respect to the Pacific context of humanities research in New Zealand, was adopted. The burden (management and financial) created by these decisions was a high level of web administration, especially during the registration phase. But it was also recognised that the HRN would develop further only if it were perceived by its sector to continue to be relevant to members’ interests.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The launch of the HRN took place on 15 October 2004 in the Council Chamber, Victoria University of Wellington, at an event preceded by a half-day seminar. The seminar programme focussed on the topic of new knowledge creation in the humanities and its links to the arts and social sciences, under two themes: <i>Creating new knowledge: research and research funding in the arts and humanities</i>; and <i>Sustaining knowledge: the role of national organisations</i>. Recent developments in Australia were discussed by Toss Gascoigne, Executive Director of the new Council for Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (CHASS) and John Byron, Executive Director of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. Their presence was on-going evidence of the support offered by Australian leaders in the humanities to the work in New Zealand, and their interest in the HRN as an innovative development. The launch ceremony following the seminar was introduced by Professor Stuart McCutcheon, Vice-Chancellor of VUW and Chair of the NZVCC, and the HRN was launched by Rt Hon Sir Geoffrey Palmer.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The website went live in late December 2004 after an intensive development period working with the contractor, CWA New Media, a Wellington-based educational web design company. By June 2005 the HRN had about 750 initial registrants, about 25% of the estimated 2400 core users. 300 organisations in one way or another using, conserving or creating humanistic knowledge, for which it was providing news and current event information, were listed, as well as about 40 funding agencies. Other organisations like the Royal Society of New Zealand could define the membership of their sector with considerable precision as comprised of well-defined and established learned societies and professional bodies, together with Fellows of an Academy. But the same was (and is) not true for the humanities in New Zealand. A good example would be that the publications with widest circulation in New Zealand that could be said to be publishing humanistic knowledge were the journals of the Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand) and the Royal Forest and Bird Society; most academic research in the humanities carried out in New Zealand was not published in New Zealand. As will be discussed below, the lack of an Academy to grant fellowships recognising academic distinction was a further evidence of underdevelopment of the infrastructures taken for granted in much larger democratic societies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The HRN could not have been set up without sponsorship. The Founder Sponsors were: Massey University (Professor Barrie Macdonald, Pro Vice-Chancellor); Victoria University of Wellington (Professor Stuart McCutcheon, Vice-Chancellor); the National Library of New Zealand (Penny Carnaby, National Librarian); and Auckland University of Technology (Professor Rob Allen, Dean of Arts). A Board was established to oversee its administration and further development. It reported to the Council of HUMANZ and comprised the President of HUMANZ, Jonathan Mane-Wheoki (Chair), the Executive Officer of HUMANZ, Dr Brian Opie (Project Manager and Board Secretary), Michael Okkerse (HUMANZ Hon Legal Adviser), Margaret Calder (Chief Librarian, Turnbull Library), Keith Webster (Victoria University of Wellington Librarian), and Derek LeDayn (General Manager, Libraries Consortium of New Zealand). Dr Louise O’Brien had worked closely with CWA throughout the development process, and became the Site Administrator. Managing the HRN became a substantial administrative task, significantly subsidised by CWA New Media. But because it provided access to a very wide spectrum of arts and humanities research in New Zealand, for researchers (especially those whose work was internationally oriented and who may not have been aware of others locally working in related fields) and for anyone locally or internationally who wanted to contact a researcher in a specific field, the HRN provided an on-line (and the only single) source of information about the knowledge work going on in the arts and humanities in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In retrospect, the plan for the HRN was both ambitious and risky because humanities academics were not typically taken into account in university or government policies for digital investment, a situation repeated internationally. This did not mean that some in the humanities had not seen the value of moving some of their work into a computing environment; but lack of investment, training, and career incentives (still an key issue in the development of digital humanities), the fact that much of the material base of humanities research remained in non-digital formats, and that it was early days in the development of the World Wide Web as a now habitual part of humanities academics’ working lives, meant that the use of the HRN did not take off in the way its developers had hoped. If undertaken now, an HRN concept would undoubtedly be implemented in very different ways.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s1.27"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-27">3. Back to the Universities, and Forward to a New Conception</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Demonstrating that the Society had the support of the universities was a different matter. The decision to approach the Deans of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences for support was made on the basis of the business plan and the HRN, as clear marks of the ability of the Society to work effectively for the sector and with government. The initiative taken by HUMANZ was to propose to the seven Deans that they should join a new body, the Interim Council for the Humanities. An equivalent number of people at senior levels in non-academic organisations engaged in work linked to the humanities would also be invited. The task of this group would be to review the business plan and the government’s response, consider whether a national organisation was needed and, if so, whether the Society or a new kind of organisation should be developed to fulfil this role. The Society administratively supported the work of the Interim Council, which decided to establish a new national organisation. The universities, through their senior managers for arts, humanities and social sciences, each agreed to provide core funding of $10,000 annually for three years.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.28"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-28">3.1 The Humanities Trust of Aotearoa New Zealand</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The new organisation was named The Humanities Trust of Aotearoa New Zealand. The Interim Council, with its breadth of institutional representation, became the new Council for the Humanities. Two members of the HUMANZ Council, who had been involved from the beginning in 1991, transferred to the Trust, one as Deputy Chair and the other as Executive Director. The Trust largely took over the constitution, mission statement, functions like the HRN, and the financial reserves of the Society, which was subsequently wound up in 2006.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A notable event in this transition was the Hui Whakawhanaungatanga, organised by the Society and held at The Alexander Turnbull Library, National Library of New Zealand, on 27 June 2005. It was a ceremony to confirm the transfer of the name, Te Whāinga Aronui, from The Humanities Society of New Zealand (Inc) to The Humanities Trust of Aotearoa New Zealand. It was noted at the ceremony that “The name Te Whāinga Aronui was given to the then New Zealand Academy of the Humanities (Inc) at its inception in 1993 by Professor Wharehuia Milroy. He has graciously agreed that the name should be transferred to the new national organisation to represent the humanities/aronui, the Humanities Trust of Aotearoa New Zealand, at its inception.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">The new body, Te Whāinga Aronui The Humanities Trust of Aotearoa New Zealand, was established by deed on 17 June 2005. Its Mission and Goals were:</p>
<p class="quote">To promote recognition of the value of the humanities in the creation, conservation and transmission of knowledge essential to personal well-being and the cultural, social and economic development of New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Acknowledging the partnership principles under the Treaty of Waitangi in its practices and policies, the Trust shall carry out its purposes by:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">1.</span> engaging in research-based advocacy;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">2.</span> securing the inclusion of the Trust in the process of public policy-making;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">3.</span> promoting public awareness of the value of the humanities in a democratic and inclusive society;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">4.</span> recognising distinction in the humanities;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">5.</span> encouraging cooperation between institutions engaged in work in the humanities;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">6.</span> supporting the formation of networks amongst individuals engaged in work in the humanities;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">7.</span> engaging in discussion and cooperation with related organisations in New Zealand and overseas; and</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">8.</span> engaging in any other lawful activities conducive to the fulfilment of the Trust’s purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The decision to establish it as a Trust was a direct response to the difficulties faced by HUMANZ in attempting to maintain its legitimacy through the normal procedures of an incorporated society, which imposed a heavy burden of administrative work and persistently challenged HUMANZ Council members to find ways of linking what was never a large membership, distributed across the nation in diverse professions, to the advocacy and developmental work which centred on government in Wellington, however much at least one major event, like a conference, took place each year out of Wellington. Because the scope of the humanities was much wider than their academic representation, it was also important to hold events in museums, libraries and galleries as well as universities. One of the hopes for the Humanities Research Network was that it might have offered a solution (or at least part of one) to this problem. The Trust decided that it would build its relations with its constituency through its advocacy work, the HRN, a new website, and the formation of an Academy. As a Trust, and registered with the Charities Commission, it would also be able to raise funding, maintain endowments and otherwise offer a secure basis for financial management.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.29"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-29"><i>3.1.1 Launching the Trust</i></a></h5>
<p>The Trust was publicly launched at Archives New Zealand on 24 November 2005 following a day conference hosted by Victoria University of Wellington on its Pipitea Campus. The conference was introduced the previous evening by a public lecture given at and hosted by the National Library of New Zealand by John Holden (Demos, UK), on <i>Cultural Value: a new concept for public policy</i>. A principal purpose in distributing the three parts of the Launch event across three locations in the Government Centre was to foreground the role of the new national body as an interface between the humanities-aronui and government. Having the launch at Archives New Zealand placed the culminating moment directly in the presence of the Treaty of Waitangi, which was on display there.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The conference theme was <i>The Humanities-Aronui, Cultural Value and the Public Good</i>. As with other HUMANZ conferences, the speakers were invited (rather than a Call for Papers being made) because the programme was designed to make specific points about the positioning of the humanities-aronui in the space between knowledge work and policy formation. Although it produced coherent outcomes and significant combinations of diverse perspectives, the principal disadvantage of this approach (which was as much a general problem for the new Council as it had been for HUMANZ in relation to its potential academic constituency) was that the normal academic practice of conference attendance and funding being dependent on having offers of papers accepted could not be used.</p>
<p class="noindent1">More specifically, the event was planned to give public expression to major facets of the work, purposes and relationships of the new Council. It therefore included, following the practice now well esablished by the Society:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>overseas speakers and representatives of related organizations;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>government representatives;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>topics representing a sectoral rather than a disciplinary approach to defining issues;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>speakers linked with the main discipline areas of the humanities;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>topics/sessions enabling discussion of both mātauranga Māori and European humanities;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>as much direct involvement by Council members as possible;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>direct participation by organisations representing the sector.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To illustrate. The conference was opened by Hon Steve Maharey, Minister for Research, Science and Technology, having been welcomed by the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh. The four sessions of the Conference were: <i>Research in the humanities/aronui; Traditions, Languages and Knowledge of Value; Digital Humanities; and Futures/Issues for the Humanities-Aronui:</i> <i>perspectives from New Zealand and Australia.</i> Three sessions were panels with several speakers each from different disciplinary, insitutional and national locations; the first session, on a matter of fundamental policy and intellectual significance for the humanities-aronui in New Zealand, had just one speaker, Professor Ian Donaldson FBA (Director Humanities Research Centre, ANU; Vice President, Australian Academy of the Humanities), who spoke on “Research Centres in the humanities: models, innovation, funding”. Trust Council members acted as respondents and chairpersons, as a way of publicly introducing the members of the new Council.</p>
<p class="noindent1">All the sessions merit comment, but I will give more detail about only one. The <i>Digital Humanities</i> session was intended to connect with a rapidly developing dimension of government policy work in which the humanities had little presence or influence, and which was also of increasing importance for thinking about the evolution of the humanities-aronui. To do this, it brought together a leading humanist from the United States, a public intellectual, and a younger academic: Dr Charles Henry, Vice Provost and University Librarian, Rice University in Houston, Texas, speaking on “Cyberinfrastructure and the Humanities?”; Russell Brown, Media Commentator and Journalist on “<i>Public Address</i> and the humanities in the public sphere” and Dr David Ciccoricco, English Programme, School of Culture, Literature and Society, University of Canterbury, on “Digital Fiction and Techo-Literary Criticism.” The spectrum of relations exemplified in this session, from public policy developments in the United States towards digital ICTs and their implications for humanities research and the infrastructures facilitating it, to the role of a blog engaged with current issues of public importance, and to new forms of intellectual enquiry concerning new kinds of fiction being created in digital media, brought together in one session an insight into the scope for the humanities offered by the creative and communicational capabilities of new digital media, the internet and the world wide web. The complex ways in which humanities-aronui knowledge moves and can have effects in the world were clearly suggested here, and each of the sessions added further dimensions of understanding of the importance of approaching the work of the new Council from a position between the multiplicity of agencies and modes of work in and by which knowledge in the humanities-aronui participates in and contributes to social, cultural and economic development.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The final moment of this public inauguration of the Humanities Trust and its new Council was the Launch itself, which was performed at Archives New Zealand by Hon Dr Michael Cullen, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister for Tertiary Education, and Leader of the House. Re-reading his speech is a matter for sombre reflection and regret. His observations were both accurate and appropriately optimistic, but also now succinctly identify what has been lost in the subsequent winding up of the Humanities Trust. In his address he said:</p>
<p class="quotei">I am sure all of you will agree that a body to represent the humanities in New Zealand is an idea whose time is long overdue. […] It seems to me that there is still a great divide amongst New Zealanders over the question of the value of the humanities. That is part of a much larger and more basic question which still divides us: the question of whether society exists to serve our economy, or our economy exists to serve society. […]</p>
<p class="quotei">A third barrier to the development of the humanities has been the more practical issue of the lack of a national infrastructure to represent the humanities, to advocate on their behalf, to educate the public about their role in social and economic development, and to coordinate the efforts of the various institutions and numerous individuals involved. That gap is now being filled by the creation of Te Whāinga Aronui.[…]</p>
<p class="quotei">I look forward to the Council becoming an articulate voice for the humanities, both within the agencies of government and with the wider public.</p>
<p class="quotei">As a Finance Minister with strong sympathies towards the humanities, I can say that having a peak organisation that shows leadership and innovation is a very good platform for developing good working relationships with government and funding agencies. I trust that Te Whāinga Aronui will develop those qualities, and I am sure that if does it will earn wide respect both in the corridors of power and elsewhere in the community.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.30"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-30">3.2 Recognising Distinction in the Humanities-Aronui</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">One of the original Objects of HUMANZ was to recognise academic distinction. As already noted above, the adoption of the term Academy for an incorporated society rather than a body constituted by the election of Fellows placed the Society in a strange position in relation to traditional academies, which were typically the bodies relevant to its interests internationally (although the American Council of Learned Societies did not conform to this pattern, a learned society being, basically, an organisation representing a discipline or academic field which published a peer reviewed journal). The HUMANZ Council was clear that establishing an award scheme which gave public recognition to achievement in the humanities, in both academic and other modes of the creation and dissemination of humanities knowledge, was a high priority; not only because such recognition was available for those in scientific, technological and social scientific research, but because it would be a direct way of engaging leaders in humanities research with the work of the Society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Initial work on a possible award system was undertaken by the Society in 1999, with particular emphasis on what should be distinctive about awards for accomplishment in the humanities-aonui, or New Zealand humanities. Consultation with Te Taura Whiri i Te Reo Māori The Māori Language Commission led to the term, Pou Aronui, in which “pou” literally referred to the pole supporting the whole structure of a building.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But this work could not proceed because it was obvious that a body with a small personal membership, with little organisational backing, and few academic credentials, could not by itself invent and promote a credible national academic award scheme. In order to legitimate it, association with an organisation or organisations with national standing was necessary. The Society approached the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee (NZVCC) for assistance in launching a scheme. This approach was unsuccessful because the NZVCC was not in a position to commit its member universities to supporting proposals of this kind. The matter was also informally discussed with the then Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie-Boys, who expressed a willingness to consider becoming Patron of the Society, but this conversation was not advanced because of concern about the slow but continuing decline in membership of the Society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The establishment of the Trust and, particularly, its more broadly representative Council, provided the necessary legitimation for establishing an award scheme, in the context of recognising, as the Royal Society of New Zealand had recognised in the review and revision of its Act in the mid-1990s, that a body seeking to represent the interests of a major component of the national knowledge system could not be properly effective if constituted only as a traditional academy. Consequently, the Trust was established as an advocacy organisation, just one of its aims being to provide the means of publicly recognising distinguished accomplishment in its various domains of activity. The accomplishment of this aim, nonetheless, was seen to have a high priority; providing the means of awarding distinction would both engage the various humanities professions with the wider work of the Trust and would also provide critical evidence and support for advocacy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Because of the commitment to a bicultural and bilingual approach to the humanities in New Zealand as the humanities-aronui, in this discussion of an award for distinction in knowledge work particular attention was given to the modes of knowledge creation and the marks of distinction characteristic of mātauranga Māori. An award scheme for the humanities appropriate to New Zealand conditions would have to give equal value to the modes of knowledge creation and the institutions supporting them which were characteristic of the two principal knowledge traditions in New Zealand, humanistic knowledge derived from the distinctive European and Māori traditions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Furthermore, the view was adopted that the ways in which knowledge in the humanities was conserved, disseminated, applied and created were significantly different from the sciences. While the term research was generally applied to all academic knowledge creation, it disguised the markedly different kinds of professionalism and organisational contexts in which humanities knowledge was created, circulated and had its principal social effects. The conclusion reached was that there should be two kinds of award, the Fellow (under whatever title) for distinction in research which met the requirements for high achievement in both western academic and Māori knowledge creation, and the Pou Aronui, which would recognise distinguished service to the humanities-aronui, taking into account not only contributions to knowledge as such but to its public advancement, including in particular distinguished contribution at a national level to the institutions supporting and communicating humanities–aronui knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The outcome of detailed planning and discussion by the new Council was the decision to establish the New Zealand Academy of the Humanities-Aronui. It would comprised elected Fellows, and the election process would be managed and funded by the Trust for the first three years after the introduction of the Fellowship. It was expected that the Academy would then take over responsibility for the election of new Fellows. There would be no fee for membership in the first three years, but one aspect of the transfer of the management of the Academy to its Fellows would include the need to discuss its future financing.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Becoming a Fellow of the New Zealand Academy of the Humanities (FNZAH) Te Mātanga o Te Whāinga Aronui required satisfying criteria which were consistent with other academies. It would recognise distinguished achievement in research in a field associated with the humanities-aronui over a sustained period, where this achievement is demonstrated by a combination of peer esteem, outstanding publications, and contribution to the well-being and development of the professional field.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Council established a Fellowship Selection Committee (FSC) from its academic members, which acted as a sub-committee of the Council and was chaired by Professor Warwick Slinn (Massey University). It was decided that candidates would be selected on individual merit alone; there would be no quota allocation between the different disciplines. It was anticipated that the number of new Fellows to be elected each year during the first three years of the Academy could be up to 15, with an expectation that the first year would include a significant number of emeritus professors. A rigorous nomination and selection procedure was instituted, the information provided by nominators and peer reviewers being confidential to the FSC, but with the final recommendations of the FSC being considered and approved by the Council.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Because of the need to conduct a flawless selection process, and the time it would take, the Council decided to call for nominations to the Academy in 2007, but to proceed to make an award for the Pou Aronui in 2006.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.31"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-31"><i>3.2.1 The First Pou Aronui Award</i></a></h5>
<p>It was, of course, necessary to ensure that the first award fully exemplified the concept of the award, which was understood to be the highest award to be offered by the Trust and would confer membership of the Academy. Although never directly stated as such, the quality underpinning the conception of the award, in which is manifested the fullest practice of the humanities, is the quality of wisdom – as I understand it to signify a deep possession of knowledge collectively acquired in culture and social practice over time, reflected upon analytically, critically, morally and experientially by a person who becomes a singular example of humanity and whose singularity is recognised and expressed publicly in the governance and onging evolution of human institutions. Wisdom is on the side of meaning rather than knowledge, in the sense that knowledge is wrought into a comprehensive understanding of the human situation by experience, moral insight and empathy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Professor Wharehuia Milroy (Ngai Tūhoe) was chosen as the first recipient. The epigraph to the text of his citation vividly located the cultural grounding of distinction in the humanities-aronui which the making of the award sought to recognise:</p>
<p class="quote">Tēnei au, Tēnei au te hökai nei o taku tapuwae, ko te hökai nuku, te hökai rangi, ko te hökai nei o töu tüpuna a Täne-nui-a-rangi. I pikitia ai ki ngā rangi tūhähā ki te tihi o Manono. Rokohanga atu ia ki a Io Matua Kore ka heke iho ko ngä Kete o te Wānanga. Ko te Kete Tuauri, Tuatea me Aronui. Ā, ka tiritiria, ka poupoua, ki a Papatūānuku. Ka puta ki te whei ao, ki te ao mārama. Tihei mauri ora.</p>
<p class="quote">This is me, in my entirety an imprint of the soles of my feet, embossed into the earth and the sky. The stamp of our ancestor God, Tāne-nui-a-rangi who ascended into the heavens to reach the pinnacle of the cosmos where he transformed, addressing an energy pure and parentless from which descended three vessels of knowledge, Tuauri, Tuatea and Aronui. These sacred vessels enabled the essence of human intellect to gestate and emerge as a child of Mother Earth breaking forth into the world of light and understanding, bringing the breath of everlasting life.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The award was made at a ceremony at Parliament on 2 August 2006, hosted by The Hon Steve Maharey, Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Broadcasting and Education. The award was preceded by a lecture by Professor Stuart Cunningham, Director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation, Queensland University of Technology and a member of the Council of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, on <i>The Humanities, Creative Arts and the Innovation Agenda.</i> Following the lecture, the Hon Steve Maharey presented the first Pou Aronui Award for distinguished service to the humanities-aronui to Dr Wharehuia Milroy.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.32"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-32"><i>3.2.2 Inaugurating the New Zealand Academy of the Humanities Te Mātanga o Te Whāinga Aronui</i></a></h5>
<p>On 12 November 2007 The New Zealand Academy of the Humanities Te Mātanga o Te Whāinga Aronui was inaugurated at a meeting held at the National Library hosted by the Chair of the Council for the Humanities, Professor Ken Strongman. On this occasion the first 16 Fellows were announced, their citations were read, and they were congratulated and presented with their award certificates by Professor Margaret Clunies Ross, Fellow and Past President of the Australian Academy of the Humanities and McCaughey Professor of English Language and Early English Literature and Director, Centre for Medieval Studies, University of Sydney. The disciplines and fields represented by the first Fellows included Anthropology, Education, English Literature, Film, History, Languages, Law, Maori Studies, Media Studies, Philosophy, and Religious Studies. Professor Clunies Ross’s presence at this ceremony was a further means by which the Council sought to secure the standing of the Fellowship; the Australian Academy of the Humanities had maintained a close association with HUMANZ and then the Trust, and it seemed entirely appropriate that their standing and traditions should play a part in this inaugural event. Messages of congratulation were received from the ACLS and the International Union of Academies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The second Pou Aronui award for distinguished service to the humanities-aronui was made to Professor Lloyd Geering o this occasion, and the first Academy Lecture was given by Professor Philip Esler, Chief Executive, Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK), on <i>Arts and Humanities Research Benefiting the Nation: The UK Experience</i>. This lecture continued the attempt to bring into New Zealand knowledge and information about developments in the humanities in other, similar jurisdictions, and especially where these bore upon the interface between academic humanities and government research policy. The decision finally to establish a research council for the Arts and Humanities in the United Kingdom was particularly significant, given that no such agency managing public funding for research in these academic fields existed (or yet exists) in New Zealand. Hon Pete Hodgson, Minister of RS&amp;T, met with Esler and Trust representatives to discuss the work of the AHRC.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Close attention was paid to the design of invitations to the award ceremonies, and the certificates and citations which accompanied them. They were designed by Sarah Laing, their remarkably fine asthetic qualities capturing much of the distinctive ethos of the humanities-aronui.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.33"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-33"><i>3.2.3 Other awards and prizes</i></a></h5>
<p>The RSNZ offered an array of awards and prizes, including to students in secondary education, and it was easy to be envious of the ways in which these forms of recognition of achievement both provided a beneficial public service and also brought the RSNZ media attention. But the Society did what it could. A donation from a previous graduate student of English at Victoria University of Wellington enabled it to set up the HUMANZ Callen Prize, which was offered for singular achievement in English Honours. A collaboration with the UNESCO Human Sciences Subcommission, RSNZ and the Trust led to the award of an annual Humanities Writing Prize for senior secondary school students which began in 2007.</p>
<p class="noindent1">And when the Society was wound up, its reserves were passed to the new Council on the basis of an agreement that they would be used to fund prizes for emerging researchers. The terms of three prizes were agreed by the Council in 2007; they were to be awarded by a selection committee of Fellows of the Academy of the Humanities. They were “intended to commemorate the work of the Humanities Society by recognizing excellent creative, critical and theoretical knowledge work in the humanities-aronui in New Zealand/Aotearoa”, and were to be known as:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the HUMANZ Innovation Prize, awarded annually for a text that is innovative at the intersections between academic humanities and matauranga Māori.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the HUMANZ Innovation in Digital Humanities Prize, awarded annually for a text using electronic media in ways that are innovative in digital theory, conception, design, and/or purpose in digital humanities; and</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the HUMANZ Innovation in Doctoral Research Prize, awarded annually for a Ph.D. thesis in the humanities-aronui that is innovative in method, presentation, and/or research outcomes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This intention was not in the event implemented, and no awards were made. In the context of planning for the Academy, the Trust Council also decided to complement the Fellow and Pou Aronui awards with a Medal for special achievement in research in fields associated with the humanities-aronui. The model for it was the Hamilton Medal awarded by the RSNZ to the best annual researcher in the sciences, an annual award for immediate achievement in the preceding year, as opposed to the title of Fellow which was for achievement over a sustained period. This intention also was not implemented<sup><a id="note_8" href="#note8">8</a></sup>.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.34"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-34">3.3 On-going Policy and Development work</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">One of the useful strategies adopted by the new Council was to invite key people in other organisations with a national mandate to join a Council meeting for discussion and, usually, to stay for lunch so that further informal conversation could take place. These discussions were very informative for Council members and advanced understanding of the potential breadth of its advocacy role, they established personal connections with related governmental and non-governmental agencies in some part of the arts, culture and humanities field, and they increased knowledge among Council members of the range of the agencies’ current work and interests. Detailed summaries of the visitors’ presentations were, once having been cleared with them, included in the Minutes of the meeting. Of particular significance, given the subsequent outcome of the attempts to establish a national organisation for the humanities, was the early meeting with Dr Steve Thompson, then Chief Executive of RSNZ. The full report on his account of the situation of RSNZ is contained in the Minutes for Friday, 19 May 2006, and provides an excellent insight into the pressures on such a national, non-governmental organisation at that time. He emphasised how little the RSNZ could achieve if it were to be dependent on income from members, whether individuals, associations or Fellows.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The relative ease of access to governmental and other national organisations, because they were located in the capital city, underlined the importance of the Trust’s presence in Wellington. Another good example was Museums Aotearoa; meetings with the Executive Director Phillipa Tocker provided valuable insight into the issues facing museums nationally and ways in which their representational and policy work converged with that of the Trust and provided grounds for collaboration (and also helped the Trust to find suitable office space in the same building when the rent on the space it was using became too expensive).</p>
<p class="noindent1">After the Launch conference, the Council adopted as a directive for conferences the concept of <i>transformations</i>, and the meetings became congresses, to emphasise their intention of bringing together people from across the field of the arts, culture and the humanities to discuss issues of broad national relevance. The model was the annual Canadian Congress, at which all the learned societies in humanities and social sciences held their annual meetings together, and events associated with their interests were linked to a theme of public importance to which the contribution of the humanities and social sciences was foregrounded in keynote lectures and other meetings. Even if a key difference was the comparative lack of learned societies, the Humanities Research Network provided a link to a wide spectrum of organisations in the arts, culture and humanities field. The Congresses continued to serve an important function at the interface between government and professional workers in the humanities-aronui.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Transformations ’06 was held at the Auckland University of Technology. Its theme was <i>Working Knowledge: Transforming Aotearoa New Zealand through education, the arts and the humanities-aronui</i> and the statement of purpose read:</p>
<p class="quote">The purpose of this conference is to investigate the interrelationships between education, the arts and the humanities/aronui in the creation and dissemination of knowledge of value.</p>
<p class="quote">Education is to society as industry and business are to the economy. Cultural knowledge is the bedrock on which human societies and economies are built; it is vital knowledge, being both created and conserved by real people in the ordinary process of social living in specific places and landscapes. The most complete diffusion of cultural knowledge is achieved primarily through the systems of life-long education, cultural institutions and public media.</p>
<p class="quote">In the present world order, thinking about knowledge is dominated by the interrelation of western science, technology and economic production. Research-based innovation is highly valued, but the role of the arts and of teaching as powerful means of generating new knowledge and initiating innovation, especially innovation leading to new social and cultural forms and practices, is not. A new account is needed to guide and inform further social and economic transformation in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This meeting was organised as other conferences had been, with a programme of invited speakers. But a significant step was taken with Transformations ’07, which was held at Victoria University of Wellington on the theme, <i>Composing the nation: ideas, peoples, histories, languages, cultures, economies.</i> Keynote speakers were invited, but there was also a call for papers, which encouraged more academics to attend and participate. The statement of purpose read:</p>
<p class="quote">National identity is a strategic priority of the New Zealand government, and a critical issue in the evolution of the nation-state in an era marked by globalisation, new ICTs, post-colonial revision of national histories, cultural and religious conflict, knowledge societies and creative economies.</p>
<p class="quote">This conference aims to</p>
<p class="slist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>foreground the diversity of research into these issues being carried out in Aotearoa New Zealand</p>
<p class="slist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>explore the relation between this research and public policy formation on national identity, and</p>
<p class="slist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>showcase this research, build coalitions of interest, and identify new lines of enquiry, especially across disciplines, cultures and media.</p>
<p class="noindent1">On this occasion, the Congress was opened by The Honourable Anand Satyanand, PCNZM, Governor-General, who had become the Patron of the Council for the Humanities, and Hon Steve Maharey, Minister of Research, Science and Technology.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Planning for the 2008 Congress had identified a title, <i>Education in the twenty-first century: culture, citizenship, media, economy, innovation</i>, and a statement of purpose, anchored by a quotation from John Dewey:</p>
<p class="quotea">The devotion of democracy to education is a familiar fact. The superficial explanation is that a government resting upon popular suffrage cannot be successful unless those who elect and who obey their governors are educated. Since a democratic society repudiates the principle of external authority, it must find a substitute in voluntary disposition and interest; these can be created only by education. But there is a deeper explanation. A democracy is more than a form of government; it is primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated experience. […] A society which is mobile, which is full of channels for the distribution of a change occurring anywhere, must see to it that its members are educated to personal initiative and adaptability. Otherwise, they will be overwhelmed by the changes in which they are caught and whose significance or connections they do not perceive. [John Dewey, <i>Democracy and Education</i> (1916), chp.7 sec.2 ]</p>
<p class="quote">Education amplifies the work of the family, laying the foundations of cultural identity and citizenship, transmitting collective knowledge to new generations, opening minds to global (and wider) horizons.</p>
<p class="quote">This conference proposes to enquire into and celebrate the role of education in a globalising and networked world order, not as a service industry but as a key factor in the survival of human society and the invention of sustainable modes of living.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But the circumstances of the Trust, facing the ending of the financial support from the universities and the failure of the second attempt to be funded as a service provider by the government, meant that planning was suspended.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.35"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-35"><i>3.3.1 Staying Centred on Research Policy</i></a></h5>
<p>As the central policy focus of the Trust, significant further work was done on applications of the Research Policy. A couple of major initatives were developed, which serve now as both a logical evolution of the thinking done during the two decades marking the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, and evidence of the kinds of claims which needed (and need) to be made for the value of new knowledge creation in the humanities-aronui.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One proposal was to establish a National Institute for Research the Humanities-Aronui (NIRH-A). Such an institute would</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>provide a model for the evolution of new modes of research in the humanities-aronui, especially modes which link the range of professional institutions engaged in some aspect of the humanities-aronui;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>provide evidence for policy argumentation aimed at changing the valuation of work in the humanities-aronui (teaching, research, conservation and dissemination of knowledge) as it is currently expressed in category funding and other measures for the allocation of public funding for knowledge work.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Examples of research projects which could be conducted by an NIRH-A were: Science in the Humanities-Aronui; The Humanities-Aronui and National Identity; and, The Humanities-Aronui and Economic Transformation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">From another angle, the Council developed a multi-pronged plan for research related to government objectives, again as a way of demonstrating the pertinence of research using humanities methodologies and modes of analysis. <i>Humanities-Aronui Research and Public Objectives</i> (2006) was a substantial document. Its purpose is stated directly:</p>
<p class="quote">The proposal addresses itself to the government’s strategic priority areas of economic transformation, families, and national identity. It puts forward a cluster of research projects, each of which is designed to connect in some way with the others so that a substantial body of interlinked knowledge is created and relationships between the priority areas are made apparent. It is intended to assist in the creation of new models for thinking about the future of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p class="quote">The ultimate test of a society and a nation is its answers to the question, “What does it mean to be human?” This is also the question which underlies knowledge creation in the humanities-aronui.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The research programme was set out in a grid formation, with the three strategic priorities of the government – economic transformation, families and national identity set out across the top, and the themes down the left hand side – policy, education, culture and innovation, and digital (content) strategy. The titles of specific projects were written into each of the cells where theme and priority intersected. The first phase of the research would be the close analysis of the texts of government policy documents in each priority area.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Three outcomes of the project as a whole were to be:</p>
<p class="quote">1. an inclusive description of the constituents of the humanities-aronui sector (cultural and educational institutions, public sector organisations, media organisations, legal institutions, civil society organisations) on the basis of which an accurate account of their economic and social value can be achieved;</p>
<p class="quote">2. establishing appropriate criteria for measuring and representing the economic value of humanities-aronui knowledge, including the creative arts and media; and,</p>
<p class="quote">3. establishing that advanced knowledge and training in the humanities-aronui (including the creative arts and media) can provide the fundamental cognitive and imaginative capabilities needed for further development of the knowledge society as a society based on innovation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">And then it put a figure on the proposal, $1.5m over three years, beginning in 2007. This level of funding for a complex set of inter-related research projects (an echo of the plan for the History of Print Culture in New Zealand programme of research) would also</p>
<p class="quote">provide a practical means of further evaluating the means and structure through which public funding for research in the arts and humanities-aronui is provided and allocated. Given the widespread concern with the cost of administering funding systems, the methods of funding allocation should also be considered. There are many possible models, for example, the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, the Tertiary Education Commission/BRCSS, the History programme in Ministry of Culture and Heritage, Creative New Zealand, the recently established Arts and Humanities Research Council in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="quote">The humanities-aronui have been challenged to demonstrate the real value of the knowledge which they create, and to focus research expertise on issues of particular significance to New Zealand. This research programme is offered as an immediate and practical solution to this challenge; but it cannot be implemented unless a new allocation of public good research funding is made available. It would clearly not advance any knowledge sector’s interests if the establishment of the funding envelope we are proposing were to be at the expense of other areas of research.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As was so often the case during the nine years of the Labour government, Hon Steve Maharey was the principal recipient of this proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Was the proposal hopelessly unrealistic? Nothing came of it except one unfunded publication, <i>Representing the Family: an analysis of concepts of ‘the family’ in some New Zealand government policy and research documents, 2003–2007</i></p>
<p class="noindent1">(2008), by an independent researcher, Dr Anne Opie. But how else to dramatise the effective exclusion from the research funding system of research in the humanities-aronui (this was, after all, a tiny claim in the context of techno-scientific research) and to illustrate its potential, both to government and to humanities researchers?</p>
<p class="noindent1">A revision of the inherited <i>Research Policy (1996)</i> was undertaken following the completion of the second report commissioned by the government in 2005 (discussed below), with the aim of advancing discussion of its recommendations. It kept the description of the humanities-aronui, but relegated it to appendix. Instead, it opened with a claim,</p>
<p class="quote">Public policy for arts, culture and humanities-aronui research is a crucial component of research, innovation and cultural policies. The purpose of this paper is to argue for and achieve full recognition in government knowledge policies of this fact and of the value of knowledge created in traditional and new disciplines by arts, culture and humanities-aronui research.</p>
<p class="noindent">It went on to locate the case for funding to develop humanities-aronui research as a fully contributory dimension of a national research system by anchoring its argument on the need for a Research Council as the core component of a national arts, culture and humanities-aronui research system:</p>
<p class="quote1">2.1 A Research Council;</p>
<p class="quote1">2.2 A Centre of Research Excellence;</p>
<p class="quote1">2.3 Capability building and infrastructures for research in the digital environment;</p>
<p class="quote1">2.4 Coordinated information which demonstrates the contribution of cultural knowledge creation to society and the economy, enabling effective policy development for and planning of the research system;</p>
<p class="quote1">2.5 Means of disseminating research;</p>
<p class="quote1">2.6 Integration of the key sectors of an arts, culture and humanities-aronui research system, including research organisations, cultural institutions and government agencies;</p>
<p class="quote1">2.7 Formation and sustaining of communities of research interest (traditionally known as “learned societies”); and</p>
<p class="quote1">2.8 Means of enhancing national and international forms of collaboration and exchange in research and development in the arts and humanities-aronui.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The obvious precedent used in the paper was the establishment of the United Kingdom Arts and Humanities Research Council. The paper included a schematic representation of the Cultural Knowledge (arts, culture and humanities-aronui) Research System, which identified what was distinctive about its resources, institutional and funding infrastructure, modes of expertise and research practice, forms of research outcome, and modes of dissemination. On the matter of funding, the paper located in a brief form the basic changes required of both the government and the humanities:</p>
<p class="quote">It is important to recognize that the historical imbalances in investment in the different principal kinds of knowledge in New Zealand reflect long-standing differential valuations of these kinds of knowledge in western societies.</p>
<p class="quote">To begin the process of redressing these imbalances will require new investment, not just the redistribution of existing allocations within the cultural sector. Arts, culture and humanities-aronui researchers will, correspondingly, need to form new accounts of the work they do which demonstrate the importance of cultural knowledge for New Zealand’s present and future development in the contexts of its complex cultural history and the evolution of global culture.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.36"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-36"><i>3.3.2 Languages Policy</i></a></h5>
<p>The long-term failure in New Zealand to formulate a languages policy was an issue acknowledged from the beginning, and exemplfied in the 1995 Conference <i>Fragments and Fusions. Language, Culture, Media</i>, which was particularly focussed on Māori Language Year. But substantive work on it really got underway during the formation of the new Council for the Humanities. A workshop on languages policy took place on 28 February 2008, at Victoria University of Wellington. It was organised by Victoria Link in association with the Council, International Languages Aotearoa (ILANZ), and the Pacific European and Asian Languages Advisory Group (PEALAG). The Council agreed to take a lead role in further work, and the Humanities Research Network was to be used to facilitate discussion. A member of the Council, Dr Sharon Harvey (AUT), continued this work after the incorporation of the humanities into RSNZ (discussed below), and a report, <i>Languages in Aotearoa New Zealand,</i> was published in 2013<sup><a id="note_9" href="#note9">9</a></sup>.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.37"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-37"><i>3.3.3 Digital (Content) Strategy</i></a></h5>
<p>Throughout the transition period from the Society to the Trust, submissions and representations continued to be made. One main strand from the beginning, not exemplified in this narrative, was tertiary education. Another was cultural institutions, and specifically libraries. The rapid development of digital information and communications technologies brought with it new policy developments as the government got to grips with access, investment and infrastructural issues. In June 2004 the government published the draft Digital Strategy, and the Society made a substantial response which was also a critique of the policy. The opening paragraph provides a succinct statement of the overall position informing the Society’s argument:</p>
<p class="quote">The vision addresses a very important situation, the global introduction in a short period of time of new technologies for the communication, conservation and creation of knowledge and information. However, it confuses ends with means persistently. The <u>social and cultural processes</u> of knowledge creation and use for social and cultural purposes (including economic purposes) are not <u>determined</u> by the available ICTs but exist in a dynamic relationship with them. It typically attributes the current economic importance of the businesses developing and installing digital networks to the technology itself, rather than observing that this period is distinguished (like the period following Gutenberg’s invention of the preceding mass ICT, print technology) by complex social and cultural transformations which are both demanding and creating opportunities for new ICTs. The common factor in the vision as it combines and recombines the terms ‘economic’, ‘social’ and ‘cultural’ is the economic. Reducing the social and cultural to the economic will produce a reductive vision, an outcome the Strategy seems to be aware of (‘narrow economic viewpoint’, 8) without being able to prevent. The strategy is profoundly confused in its multiple uses of the term ‘culture’, and yet it is culture which will provide the content by which, and the grounds on which, the vision of an innovative knowledge society will be realised.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In another section of the response, the very limited role ascribed to the National Library was taken up in stating a position on the integral relation between a nation’s stocks of knowledge, the institutions which conserved and provided access to them, including most importantly, education, and the technological infrastructures which connected them and the citizens who made use of them:</p>
<p class="quote">Neither conservation nor education are clearly identified as fundamental components of an ICT infrastructure. Although the National Library is clearly visible in the Strategy, its role as a provider of access to content (27) is emphasised over its role (as a policy leader) in an as yet underdeveloped national system of collective memory institutions (libraries, archives, galleries, museums, databases, mass media, local heritage collections); the National Content Strategy (28) seems to point in the latter direction. Education is not represented as a uniquely important, life-long social and cultural process, on the basis of which all work of economic value with information depends, but is dispersed (as in Tertiary Education Commission documents), between skills acquisition on the one hand, and advanced research on the other.</p>
<p class="noindent1">These matters were addressed in the National Library’s subsequent draft New Zealand Digital Content Strategy, published in November 2006. Goal 1 of the Strategy was, “Content important to New Zealand is easy to access, is protected, and kept safe for use by future generations”, and two of the Objectives related to this goal were:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Support the introduction of a Creative Commons licence for New Zealand</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>Promote greater public understanding of rights and responsibilities under Copyright legislation, including protection of intellectual and cultural property rights</p>
<p class="noindent1">Before the release of the document, the National Library called a meeting of organisations and individuals interested in the issue of open access to information. Its outcome was the establishment of Creative Commons licences for New Zealand.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s1.38"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-38"><i>3.3.4 Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</i></a></h5>
<p>The National Library meeting in August 2006 brought together a group of interested persons (from universities, the legal profession, government agencies and non-governmental organisations), to discuss the development of Creative Commons (CC) licences for New Zealand. An outcome of this meeting was a decision that the Trust would be asked to lead a project to establish these licences. This decision was made because of a perceived fit between the principles of open access and the domains of knowledge represented by the Trust. As a non-governmental organisation it was capable of initiating work in an area of interest to government which agencies like the National Library, which led the development of the Content Strategy, could not themselves undertake.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It became a premise of this work that resisting the apparently unlimited extension of private ownership over knowledge of all kinds (by corporations rather than individuals, when it was perceived to have actual or potential economic value) and re-asserting the fundamental importance of public good conceptions of knowledge, was of particular importance to the humanities-aronui. Not only was the economic value of humanities-aronui knowledge largely unspecified in statistical descriptions of the economy, but the fact that it had its roots and immediate relevance in civil society - culture, history, systems of belief, arts, law, philosophy, governance, and their on-going revision and re-interpretation – and that its sustaining was largely the responsibility of government through publicly funded institutions, made it clear that arguments for the value of the humanities-aronui were also arguments for public good conceptions of knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Trust Council decided that the concept of establishing the licences was consistent with the Trust’s Objects and offered a means of making its work better known. It delegated responsibility for managing CCANZ to the Board of the Humanities Research Network (HRN), which included finding funding for the work. A successful application was made to the Community Partnership Fund (CPF) managed by the Department of Internal Affairs; the basic requirement was that the applicants had to include partners to the project who would provide 50% of the funding (in money or in kind), the CPF providing the other 50%. The Board was augmented by the inclusion of people with expertise in ICT applications in the humanities and intellectual property, and partners in the CPF project. Its meetings were hosted by the Alexander Turnbull Library.</p>
<p class="noindent1">CCANZ differed in significant ways from other national CC projects. Most were run by academic lawyers based in university Faculties of Law, the model being one of a Project Lead (a lawyer) and another supporting institution with responsibility for promoting the use of the licences. The requirement that CC licences had to be compatible with current domestic copyright legislation meant that legal expertise had an obvious priority in the process of setting up a national set of CC licences; but making them also freely available for use was another important function.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Council for the Humanities combined both functions by being defined in an MOU signed with Creative Commons International as the Lead organisation while having the development work carried out by the HRN Board. It was not possible for a Faculty of Law in New Zealand to undertake the Lead role; but the Board was very fortunate to have the support of several lawyers whose collaboration (and donation of time and expertise) resulted in excellent versions of the licences and who negotiated the changes they wanted to make with CC International. The Legal Team were: Associate Professor Susy Frankel, Victoria University of Wellington, Andrew Matangi (Buddle Findlay) and Paul Sumpter (University of Auckland). The Creative Commons licences for New Zealand were derived from the English law versions, which were themselves derived from the international (American) base licences. The New Zealand licences set a precedent by adopting plain language conventions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Leading work on Creative Commons was being done by Creative Commons Australia, located in the Law Faculty at Queensland University of Technology, and a close relationship was built up. The licences were launched at a one day seminar on 27 October 2007 hosted and organised in association with the Trust by the National Library, <i>Expanding Copyright Horizons through Creative Commons –</i> <i>A seminar to build understanding of the new licensing environment in the digital world.</i> The keynote speaker was Dr Anne Fitzgerald, intellectual property and e-commerce lawyer and Adjunct Professor at the School of Law, Queensland University of Technology. Members of the Legal Team were joined by Dr. Catharina Maracke, International Coordinator, Creative Commons International, on a panel focused on understanding the licences, and discussion of the uses of the licences made up the rest of the programme. Hon Judith Tizard, Associate Minister for Commerce, attended and spoke at the conclusion of the seminar. The seminar attracted over 100 registrations and the event was recorded and webcast.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Throughout 2008, following the launch of the licences, much assistance and support was given by CC Australia. By integrating CC development with academic research and with graduate project research in law, CC Australia was able to provide a valuable knowledge base on which CCANZ could draw. It was an enviable model which the Trust’s very limited resources could not allow it to emulate. A simple website (<a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz">www.creativecommons.org.nz</a>) was developed with CWA New Media so that the licence texts could be made easily available for immediate use. The site was upgraded in August 2008 with project funding through the Community Partnership Fund, which increased the website’s functionality and ability to promote and model the use of the licences, especially by offering case studies of the uses of CC licences by New Zealand artists and teachers. The partners in this project were: The National Library of New Zealand, The Ministry of Education, Te Taura Whiri i Te Reo Māori The Māori Language Commission, and UNESCO New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Initially, among the various potential groups of users, priority was given to creative arts and education, and the first administrator, Jane Hornibrook, concentrated on publicising the licences through various networks in the creative arts. This work was assisted by funding for the administrator from the Ministry of Education, which was collaborating with Australian authorities in the development of digital learning resources, and by the existence of a list-serv set up by people committed to open access principles which became the CCANZ list. Otago Polytechnic was the first tertiary institution in New Zealand to make CC licences the core of their copyright policy. Subsequently, university libraries began to set up institutional repositories for the deposit of theses in digital format, and the use of CCANZ licences was adopted.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A significant issue, and one not simply local to New Zealand, which became clear during the meetings to set up CCANZ was how indigenous cultural property ownership, being based on collective rather than individual ownership conventions, could be represented by Creative Commons. This had a curious relation with the issue of Crown Copyright. The Ministry of Economic Development published <i>Te Mana Taumaru Mātauranga Intellectual Property Guide for Māori organisations and communities</i> in 2007, and discussions with officials involved in that major project confirmed that Creative Commons could offer an important licensing alternative which could be more sensitive to Māori conceptions of property ownership and use. Several meetings were held during and after the Launch but no decisions were then made about how to proceed. However, translating the CCANZ licences into Māori was agreed to be a useful first step, possibly overseen and funded by the Māori Language Commission; but that, too, could not be undertaken immediately.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The failure of the Council’s second approach to government for funding in 2008 threatened the sustainability of CCANZ as an on-going administrative and educational function tasked with both maintaining the licences and promoting their use. Work by officials in several government agencies on Open Access to Government Information had been proceeding for some time before the development of the CCANZ licences was undertaken, as evidenced in the Digital (Content) Strategy paper. After the change of government in 2008, interest in implementing open access was led by Hon Bill English, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. When it was decided in 2009 to adopt the CCANZ licences as the official mechanism for licensing public use of government information, the government accepted a recommendation from the officials’ group managing the initiative that funding to support the maintenance of the New Zealand CC licences should be made available for three years.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s1.39"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-39">4. An apparently fortunate conjunction</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The first business plan, <i>Five Year Strategic Plan: A Report to the Ministries of Culture and Heritage, Education, and Research, Science and Technology</i> (31 August 2001), was written during the first term of the Labour Government, and when the Council went back to the government to report on the successful meeting of the requirements placed on the Humanities Society, it dealt with the same ministers (even if there were some portfolio changes), principally Hon Pete Hodgson, Hon Steve Maharey, and Hon Judith Tizard, linking ministries and departments in science and technology, culture, and tertiary education. The Prime Minister’s commitment to the fine and performing arts (notably in the rebuilding of the funding base of the nation’s major cultural institutions) and the cultural significance of heritage (especially war history but more generally in projects concerned with national identity, like the <i>Dictionary of New Zealand Biography</i> (now on-line) and <i>Te Ara</i>, the digital encyclopedia of New Zealand), and the Deputy Prime Minister’s strong interest in the protection and development of research libraries, all seemed to provide a favourable context in which the discussions with government about the future of the Humanities Trust might be productively resolved and the basis of a strong and independent national organistion representing a sector only poorly conceptualised in government policies for knowledge and innovation might be accomplished.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the event, none of these favourable signs led to an actual outcome of the kind sought through discussions with the government over its nine year period in office. What seemed like a unique opportunity to maintain a discussion with the same principals in the government ultimately came to nothing.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Just before the launch of the Humanities Research Network in October 2004, Hon Pete Hodgson, then Minister for Research, Science and Technology, met with HUMANZ and CHASS representatives. At this meeting, in addition to a discussion about the reasons for the setting up of CHASS by the Australian Government, the Minister heard about the work done by HUMANZ to complete the Business Plan process. He invited HUMANZ to report to him again early in 2005 about progress in the implementation of the Interim Council and the development of the Humanities Research Network. When the Interim Council came to arrange this meeting, which took place on 6 April 2005, the Minister was Hon Steve Maharey.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At the meeting, the Minister affirmed the value of the proposal for a national humanities organisation, but noted that it would be difficult to make any progress on funding for 2005-6 because the budget process for the new financial year was in its final stage. The HUMANZ Strategic Plan estimate of about $300,000 in each of the first three years was put forward as an indicative amount. Instead of moving towards a discussion of proposals in the Strategic Plan for service provision by the Council, the Minister proposed that MRST should work with the ICH to prepare a paper for him setting out a costed plan. It would need to demonstrate that a national humanities organisation was needed, and it would have to indicate other sources of sponsorship. It would be important to meet again well in advance of the election, and he proposed another meeting by July.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The report he had commissioned to review progress by the Council, <i>The Humanities – Charting a Way Forward</i> (August 2005), was written by a consultant, Sally Munro, of Munro Duignan. It required a lot of time from the Council but, unlike the previous report, was fully written by her. It is an excellent review of the period about which it was written, especially developments in government research policies and their implementation. The report made a number of important recommendations designed to clarify the relation of the humanities to the government. In particular, it affirmed that the government related to research through three Ministries: science and technology through the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology; social sciences through the Ministry of Social Development; and the humanities through the Ministry for Culture and Heritage (MCH).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Nominating MCH as the lead ministry for the humanities only confirmed after nearly 20 years what had seemed obvious at the beginning, that the government had established in that phase of restructuring two policy Ministries, one for science and technology and one for arts and culture, and that the humanities would expect to work to the government through the culture ministry. Working relations were maintained throughout these two decades, but were more active during the first; the relationship seemed even more obvious when the Ministry of Cultural Affairs (MCA) became the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and took into itself the Historical Publications branch of the Department of Internal Affairs, which had initially been included in the plans for MCA. This move, which brought into MCH the <i>Dictionary of New Zealand Biography</i> and the <i>New Zealand Historical Atlas</i> projects, had the effect of making MCH the manager of the largest humanities research projects being conducted in New Zealand. When it took the further step into born digital publication with the <i>Te Ara</i> project, it placed itself at the front of new humanities R&amp;D in Aotearoa New Zealand. But the Ministry retained a traditional Arts Council conception of its cultural and cultural policy mission, and so oriented itself much more towards the creative and performing arts than to the academic humanities, thus inverting the traditional relationship between these domains of knowledge creation in the university which (at least in the British tradition) was slow to find ways of including the creative and performing arts within its conception of research.</p>
<p class="noindent1">However, it is still not possible to find the term humanities used on the MCH website to refer to any of its functions; History and Heritage define the space in the Ministry’s conception of its knowledge base which otherwise might be taken by the humanities as a more inclusive term. A search for “humanities” on the website amusingly produced the question: did you mean “womanities”? The difficulty here is that, as with UNESCO, the discourse employed by cultural policy is social scientific in origin and assumptions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">By 2008, with an election scheduled for the end of the year, there was only one decision left to be taken, since all the requirements set by the government had been met by the Trust Council, and that was the decision to fund the business plan through a purchase agreement of the kind the government had with the Royal Society of New Zealand. The decision was in the hands of the Minister for RS&amp;T, Hon Steve Maharey; but he left the government towards the end of 2007 to become the Vice-Chancellor of Massey University, and the discussions were again taken up with the Hon Pete Hodgson, who returned as Minister of RS&amp;T.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A meeting with the Minister was sought to update him on progress and took place on 10 December 2007, at which the Council agreed to consider a proposal for a closer association with RSNZ, and the Minister agreed to investigate funding. In a meeting on 13 March 2008 the Minister responded positively to the Council’s representations, but reaffirmed what had been his consistent position, that he was in favour of an association with RSNZ. The following Council meeting on 11 April 2008 considered the situation in detail; the Minutes of the meeting is a very important document for its record of the discussion in the Council about the terms on which negotiations with the RSNZ and discussions with the Minister should be conducted. Following this meeting the Chair of the Council, Professor Strongman, wrote to the Minister congratulating him and RSNZ on the joint creation of the Rutherford Foundation (with a very large endowment) and pointing out that, at the follow up meeting on 13 March, there had been no mention of funding for the humanities. The letter requested another meeting on that topic.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The next step is marked by a crucial letter (18 August 2008) from the Chair to the Minister which included a paper, <i>The Humanities-Aronui in the national knowledge system.</i> This paper set out a detailed review of actions by the Council and the government in relation to the recommendations of both reports commissioned by the government; it demonstrated that very little of what had been recommended as government actions had been undertaken. The response was a meeting on 19 September 2008 between representatives of the Trust Council and RSNZ chaired by a MRST official and including officials from TEC and MCH.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Council’s Executive Committee Minutes for a meeting later that day record a summary of discussions at the meeting, in which it was as though nothing had been done, and no reports written for government, before this moment. The Council representatives were told that, although the then Minister, Hon Steve Maharey, had affirmed his acceptance of the recommendations of <i>The Humanities – Charting the Way Forward,</i> the key point now was not the content of a purchase agreement:</p>
<p class="quote">the basic issue which CH has to confront, as does the government, is, What demand is there in government for what the Council has to offer?</p>
<p class="quote">The emphasis in the subsequent discussion remained substantially on the matter of the ‘value proposition’, with the RSNZ representatives underlining their need for a text which would make it clear to RSNZ members what value CH would add to the RSNZ.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The observation that “the government had two principal priorities, integration and innovation”, seemed to apply only to the incorporation of the humanities into RSNZ, whereas the Council in its paper to the Minister which occasioned the meeting noted that “<i>The Humanities-Charting a way forward</i> acknowledges the fragmentation of the arts, culture and humanities-aronui in government. The Council’s broadly representative Trust Board is designed to advance integration of the sector but requires government support to fulfil this role.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">The chasm which opened up at this point can be succinctly illustrated from a section of the letter from the Chair of the Council, in which he observed how the on-going delays in settling the situation of the Council meant that critical work on behalf of the humanities-aronui was not being done:</p>
<p class="quote">A most dramatic instance of this urgently needed work is provided by the just published <i>From Strength to Strength. Government’s Agenda for New Zealand Research, Science and Technology</i> (MoRST, 2008). In its draft form as <i>The New Zealand Research Agenda</i>, the aim to set out an inclusive policy for research was to be highly commended even if the document was principally about the role and requirements of scientific research and its technological applications. The final version has clarified its purpose, notably in the Note for Readers, where it is clearly stated that ‘Wider knowledge-creating activities, such as research contributing to non-scientific knowledge in the arts, cultural and humanities spheres, are not a focus of this Agenda.’</p>
<p class="noindent1">The position paper included the following proposal, to make the point in a different way:</p>
<p class="quote">The Council for the Humanities should be commissioned to prepare a report, <i>A New Beginning: The Government’s Agenda for Research - Arts, Culture, and Humanities-Aronui</i>, to advance the research prioritisation exercise.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>The Humanities – Charting a Way Forward</i> surprisingly did not explicitly incorporate the previous business plan, but proposed that various actions be undertaken by MCH and the Council which would be the first steps in developing the Ministry’s lead role and also demonstrate the Council’s ability to provide evidence-based policy advice to the government. A policy research project initiated by MRST in partnership with MCH on cultural industries, proposals for which were to be submitted by 1 October 2007, was set up as the test of the ability of the humanities to contribute to evidence-based policy formation. Background to the proposal included a recommendation from <i>The Humanities – Charting a Way Forward</i> that “in order to match humanities research with government outcomes, there needed to be a clearer articulation of demand from government end-users.” Interested applicants were advised that “This project is interested in the way the cultural industries intersect with the creative industries. Cultural industries generally refer to libraries, museums, music, screen, performing arts, literature and the visual arts. […] The research project will examine issues facing the development of New Zealand’s cultural industries and the role of government in supporting their development and ongoing sustainability.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">Instead of the Council’s being invited to undertake this project as a test of its capacity, which seemed to be the intention of the report, a call for tenders for the research project was advertised by MRST. The Council made a bid, as did other research agencies, and the contract was awarded to Otago University. This procedure was normal for competitive, government-funded research projects but contrasted to the earlier project, when MRST contracted the Humanities Society following the Cultural Foresight project to write a report which would demonstrate the value of applying humanities methodologies to public policy issues, and which resulted in <i>Knowledge, Creativity and Innovation: Designing a Knowledge Society for a Small, Democratic Country</i> (2000), discussed above. Making the new project contestable placed the Council in competition with university research offices and private research organisations who were constantly trawling for external research funding. As a result, a critical development opportunity for the Council was lost. It was critical in various ways, because it could have: positioned the Council as a distinct voice linking its sector to government, through the application of humanities methodologies in policy advice to the government; given the Council experience of managing work integral to its advocacy role; allowed the Council to mobilise its international connections and so add value of that kind to policy development in New Zealand; and, of course, the project funding would have helped sustain its administrative development.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.40"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-40">4.1 Addressing Members of Parliament</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">As part of the process of advancing its Research Policy, the Council refreshed the document it had inherited from the Humanities Society in 2007 and circulated it to Chief Executives and Members of Parliament. Achieving awareness among Members of Parliament about the work being done for the humanities was much more difficult and demanding of available resources than working through Ministers and their respective Ministries. However, the holding of the first Pou Aronui award at Parliament provided an occasion and an incentive to widen contact. All MPs were consequently invited to attend this event, and some positive expressions of interest were received. In 2007 the Council discussed the concept of a humanities caucus in Parliament, following the example of the ACLS. An informal conversation with Hon Bill English led to the suggestion that he, together with Hon Dr Michael Cullen, could be asked to form a cross-party grouping. Members of Parliament and Chief Executives of relevant Ministries and Departments were invited to the 2007 Congress and the subsequent launch of Creative Commons. In Australia, breakfast meetings at the Federal Parliament with speakers from the arts, culture and humanities talking on public policy issues, had been introduced. CHASS had created a list of academics who would be willing to meet and talk with Members of Parliament, and was providing some training in how to approach and conduct such conversations. None of these possibilities were able to be implemented. The way of involving MPs in the work of the Trust largely remained what it had been from the beginning, invitations to Ministers to open and speak at conferences.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s1.41"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-41">4.2 Joining the Royal Society of New Zealand</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Throughout the two decades from the inception of the New Zealand Academy for the Humanities, contacts had been maintained between its officers and those of the RSNZ. From the Academy’s point of view, the RSNZ was the only national non-governmental organisation representing knowledge as such, and so it was important for close contact to be made and maintained. Apart from any other consideration, there was a lot to be learned about how to fill such a space, not least when questions of independence arose as a result of being the recipient of public funding. Many of the conversations which took place were similar to those with the administrators of other national humanities organisations, focussing on the implications of occupying a space between academic and professional bodies on the one hand, and governmental agencies on the other.</p>
<p class="noindent1">An MOU was signed between the RSNZ and the Society in 2006. From the beginning of the Strategic Plan process in 2001, the notion of widening the objects of the RSNZ to include the humanities was a shadow over the discussions because it declined the Society’s principal argument for the difference in the national knowledge system of the arts, culture and the humanities, and the need to have that difference fully articulated. Superficially, since universities contained most of the spectrum of disciplinary knowledges, one organisation should be sufficient to represent the whole. But this position overlooked the fact that humanisitic knowledge is not always or typically produced in a research environment conforming to conventions of objectivity and rational method; it also overlooked the issue of advocacy, and the fact that a single organisation would be unable to engage with questions of public policy and funding allocation when its parts were in competition, especially for funding. The RSNZ as an organisation representing the sciences was able to engage directly with the government since both parties used a shared techno-scientific discourse; this situation did not pertain for the arts, culture and the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One of the officials’ recommendations following the completion of the <i>Five Year Strategic Plan</i> was “4. Association of the humanities with the Royal Society, on the model of the arrangements for the Social Sciences.” Representatives of the Society met with the Council of RSNZ, and a brief report of this meeting was included in a 2002 Newsletter to members:</p>
<p class="quote">The questions which were put to the RSNZ Council were these:</p>
<p class="quote">Do you believe that it is actually in the Royal Society’s interest as well as the nation’s to have a strong national organisation representing the humanities/aronui? If you do, then HUMANZ would appreciate your support in making this point to the government.</p>
<p class="quote">If you think that one national organisation can feasibly represent the whole knowledge spectrum with some kind of equality of representation, is this a task which the Royal Society would want to take on, and within what time frame?</p>
<p class="quote">A further meeting at which the complex issues raised by Option 4 can be discussed in more detail has been foreshadowed. It may be more appropriate for a proposal to establish an electoral college for the humanities in the Royal Society to come as a joint proposal from university representatives of the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">With the formation of the Humanities Trust, a new MOU emphasising collaboration in areas of common interest was signed in 2006. The assumption informing the last point quoted from the 2002 Newsletter remained in place until quite late in the discussions in 2008 with the RSNZ, that is, that even if the academic segment of the humanities got access to Fellowships by becoming an electoral college of the RSNZ Academy, a national organisation representing the much broader interests of the humanities-aronui would continue.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Correspondence and Minutes of the Council’s meetings during 2008 provide a full and clear record of the issues the Council was attempting to negotiate in its relations with the government and the RSNZ, while keeping in the foreground the lacunae in government policy and national infrastructure which the Council was doing its best to identify and to fill. It is clear that the Council was, until very late in the process, working towards establishing a closer relationship with RSNZ on the basis that the Trust would continue as an independent organisation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Late in 2007 the government was presented with what appeared to be a way out of any responsibility for the future of the Humanities Trust, or the development of policies specifically for research in the humanities. At a meeting with the Minister, the President of the Royal Society offered the Royal Society as a home for the humanities. From the perspective of the Council’s discussions with the government, the timing could not have been worse. While neither Minister had made any commitments beyond accepting the reports, the only action left in the long process was for Hon Pete Hodgson to affirm or refuse an arrangement whereby the government would purchase services from the Trust as set out in the first business plan. The offer from RSNZ had not been formally put to the Council before it was made to the Minister and its immediate effect was to derail the discussion with the government at its final stage. Instead of furthering the obvious relationship with MCH, MRST became again the agency under whose aegis the new process was to be conducted. A clear implication was that any funding from the government for the humanities, like the funding provided for the services RSNZ provided on behalf of the government to the science sector, would be channelled through and administered by the RSNZ. The narrower conception of research, as the term under which relation between the humanities and the government was persistently located, ignored the whole scope of the work of humanities knowledge in society which those working towards securing a national organisation for the humanities had endlessly affirmed and described.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Council understood that it had no choice but to work through the proposal since it had been endorsed by the Minister. It was not that there was no desire in the Council for a strong working relationship with RSNZ; in fact, the contrary was the case, and the MOU committed both bodies to cooperation in areas of mutual interest. Joining RSNZ had been proposed as a solution during the first business plan process, the then Minister, Hon Pete Hodgson, agreeing to effect changes in the RSNZ Act to include the humanities; but the suggestion was withdrawn when it was realised that the RSNZ Act, being a private act, could not be changed by the Minister, and the Act was very clear that the purposes of the RSNZ were to promote only science and technology. At that time, the Royal Society of Canada had been proposed as a model, since it followed the form of Enlightenment academies in including the whole spectrum of formal knowledge. The analogy was questionable, since the bodies actually representing the humanities to the Canadian government – the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council - were new interface organisations designed to meet the government’s need for expert advice and reflecting a bureaucratic and not academic mode of classifying knowledge. On the later occasion, the Royal Society of Edinburgh was proposed as a feasible model, whereas the key United Kingdom organisations at the interface with government were the research councils and, for the humanities and social sciences, the British Academy. As I have already noted, those involved in setting up the Humanities Society were fortunate to be able to observe, through international links established early in the 1990s, initially through the American Council of Learned Societies, the pressures for change in the work of traditional academy-type organisations. Governments were requiring more in return for the funding they provided, especially expert contributions to policy development, and these organisations were having to develop new capabilities to meet this demand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is also important to note that, in 2007 and 2008, RSNZ was going through another review. One consequence was to realign the Academy with the RSNZ Council. But the scale of the review was fully revealed in April 2008 at a “New Horizons” event at which, among other developments for science in New Zealand, the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Sir Ernest Rutherford’s receiving the Nobel Prize was celebrated with the endowment of the Rutherford Foundation. This action was in such a startling contrast to the response to the representations of the Council on behalf of the humanities-aronui that I will quote from the report I wrote for the Trustees of the Council on this aspect of the whole event. The Foundation will</p>
<p class="quote">provide funding for doctoral and postdoctoral research and early career development, and support for science teachers (‘the foundation of the science system’). The Governor General, who is patron of the RSNZ, has agreed to be Patron of the Foundation. […]</p>
<p class="quote">It will begin with $2m and fund Phd scholarships and postdoctoral fellowships at Cambridge University (UK), and postdoctoral fellowships within New Zealand to attract back NZers who are overseas. In association with the Royal Society (UK) it will support science leadership training for Phd and postdoctoral researchers; in association with the RS (Edinburgh) it will support enterprise training. Other training will be made available through partnerships with the Royal Navy and the Royal NZ navy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Minister, Hon Pete Hodgson, announced that the government would be giving $1m annually to the Foundation, the other initial $1m coming from the RSNZ. In international terms, these are tiny amounts of money. In the terms on which the Council was approaching the government, they seem breathtaking. I commented in that report that</p>
<p class="quote">There was no mention of the humanities or of funding. It continues to surprise me that scientists’ ‘mentality’ is so dominated by the double sense of inadequate appreciation of their value to society and its correlation with inadequate funding for their work. […] The effect of negligible public investment over decades in infrastructures for the humanities, in comparison to the sciences, is unstated and undescribed but is critical to the issues facing the Council in its relation to its sector. Scientists EXPECT public investment and support.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Council established two conditions that were to provide the basis of discussions about the terms on which the humanities could enter RSNZ: the independence of the humanities should be maintained in any future form of association; and, the RSNZ Act should be revised to include the humanities-aronui. These conditions should have presented a significant difficulty, because the development of the Humanities Trust was premised on a broad rather than exclusively academic conception of the composition of what could otherwise be called the “non-science” sector. The leadership role adopted by the Trust Council in the implementation of Creative Commons licensing in New Zealand, the management of the Humanities Research Network, the policy work done by the Council, its well-established links with other similar bodies internationally, its distinctive logo and signage, and its status as a charitable trust were clear evidence that revision of the RSNZ Act to include the humanities would require more than merely inserting the term humanities wherever “science and technology” currently appeared.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s1.42"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-42">5. The last phase</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">I have only observed this phase, which marks the almost complete loss of an independent identity for the humanities, from a distance. But it has followed a predictable course, which I will comment upon in respect of the outcome for main components of the Humanities Trust, including its Council, its Academy, the Humanities Research Network, and Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>The Trust Council</i></p>
<p>The Trust Council transferred as a whole to RSNZ at the beginning of 2010. The outcome for the Council and its members was anticipated by the initial intention in the RSNZ that the incorporation would be achieved by taking only a selected group from the Trust Council into the Social Science panel. However, the transitional process, in order to respect the requirement of the Council that the humanities would be regarded as a distinct knowledge domain within the RSNZ, now to have almost universal coverage of the academic research spectrum, required the transition of the full Council, half of its members representing non-academic bodies in the cultural institutional field, into the RSNZ structure as a new panel, the Humanities Panel.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In effect, the mode of thinking which governed this process of incorporation of a a “foreign” body into RSNZ was that of academic organisation. The Humanities Panel initially was like a university Faculty or College of the Humanities (with a few extras), but then was moved even closer to the most characteristic formation, with humanities and social sciences bundled together in one administrative unit. This unit is distinguished by its objects of study, society and culture, by its marginality to the current knowledges of most value in the sciences and business fields, and by its low level of access to research funding. It is also distinguished by a fundamental split, in conceptions of research method (empirical and interpretive) and the purposes of and audiences for the knowledge created by academic work, and by the almost inevitably political significance of its teaching and research. All of these disabilities in the current official settlement in government and university about what constitutes knowledge of value could only be mitigated for the humanities through advocacy by an organisation dedicated to the specific, non-scientific qualities and purposes of humanities knowledge, able to work in association with similar, well-established organisations internationally. Little if anything of those links and relationships established with such organisations and with much support from them will have carried over.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This decision brought with it some administrative difficulties, since the procedure for election to panel membership required an electoral college of professional organisations to nominate panel members. One of the many differences already noted above between the humanities and the science, social science and technological knowledge domains is that there is no professional organisational structure for humanities disciplines (there is, for example, no professional organisation external to the universities with an expert view of research and teaching, as there is in most other professionalised areas of knowledge work). This point is onfirmed by the small number of organisations constituting what is now the humanities portion of the Humanities and Social Sciences Discipline-Based Forum: The Australian and New Zealand Communications Association, the Institute of Registered Music Teachers of New Zealand, the New Zealand Historical Association, and the Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia. The range of even traditional humanities disciplines is clearly unrepresented.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Although RSNZ undertook to provide the funds necessary to cover the additional costs of bringing the humanities into the RSNZ, it turned out that the expectation that the Government, having agreed to this course of action, would provide those funds, was disappointed. A shameful consequence was that the HUMANZ reserves, the result of voluntary effort and donation, which were transferred to the Humanities Trust on the basis of a formal agreement that they would be used to support research in the humanities, especially among emerging researchers, were instead used to cover the administrative costs of the incorporation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It was not the case that members of RSNZ immediately perceived that value would accrue to RSNZ as a result of the participation of the humanities, the process of adjusting to the participation of the Social Sciences having been quite a challenge to disciplinary professionals in both the natural and social scientific domains in the 1990s. Members of the RSNZ Academy had from time to time expressed concern about the lack of recognition available to humanities researchers, but that was not quite the same thing as a decision to include the humanities among the spectrum of kinds of knowledge represented by RSNZ in public policy and funding discussions. There were Fellows of the RSNZ Academy whose academic work was conventionally regarded as in the humanities, for example, historians, but their acceptance had come through the social sciences.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>The New Zealand Academy of the Humanities Te Mātanga o Te Whāinga Aronui</i></p>
<p>When discussions about the entry of the humanities into RSNZ began, the New Zealand Academy of the Humanities had only been established for two years, and about 30 Fellows had been elected. It was anticipated that a governing body for the Academy would be set up in 2009, after which the Academy would become responsible for conducting the election process itself, following international conventions. Looking ahead to the Academy’s assumption of responsibility for the election of Fellows in 2009, the Council appointed one of its members, Professor John Burrows, who was also a Fellow of the Academy of the Humanities, to act as transitional convenor of the Academy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">However, this stage was not reached, and the Fellows (including those elected in 2009) were invited to change their Fellowships in the Academy of the Humanities and become Fellows of the Royal Society. Given that the purpose of an academy is to recognise research excellence, the assimilation of the Academy of the Humanities into the Royal Society Academy was the simplest step because it replicated the ordinary situation of university coverage of the academic disciplinary field. It was not automatic that the persons who had become FAHNZ would be invited to exchange that Fellowship for the title of FRSNZ but, in the event, all but two were. The Fellows were not aware of the discussions taking place until they were offered the opportunity to change the title of their Fellowship. There was some protest about the lack of consultation, and the loss of humanities in the Fellowship title, but the incorporation went ahead anyway. One area of potential difficulty, the recognition of Māori scholarship outside the conventions of western academic work, was obviated by the appointment to Fellowships of Māori scholars whose Western academic credentials were well established. It is pleasing that the Academy Fellows page on the RSNZ website includes the title FAHNZ for those who became FRSNZ.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But at least there was a clear analogy in the purpose and method for the Fellow award. The same did not apply in respect of the Pou Aronui. This was designed to be a higher award than that of the Fellowship, and included membership of the Academy of the Humanities. Its purpose was to acknowledge the distinctive means by which leadership in the humanities-aronui was exercised in Aotearoa New Zealand, through research, teaching, public action, communal leadership, guardianship of linguistic and cultural inheritances, a singular vision for the future of humanity. The conception of wise leadership, of a person who would, as a result of the award, reciprocate by being willing to be consulted and offering advice on the work of the Council, was lost. In its transfer to RSNZ, the Pou Aronui has become just another form of recognition of service, and does not include membership of FRSNZ. The RSNZ has continued with the annual Academy Lecture, as the Aronui Lecture.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>Creative Commons</i></p>
<p>Because overseas developments in open science were only just beginning to filter into RSNZ thinking, the potential of Creative Commons was not initially perceived. But the government’s decision to provide funding to sustain the dveelopment of the licences encouraged RSNZ to provide a space for this project alongside other special purpose funds the Society administered; RSNZ reciprocally provided a secure system for managing the funds. But Creative Commons could no longer be presented as an integral component in the public good work of the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>Humanities Research Network Te Whatunga Rangahau Aronui</i></p>
<p>The Humanities Research Network which, in view of subsequent developments in virtual research infrastructures, could be said to have been ahead of its time, was parked. No further action was undertaken to redevelop it; and nothing has been introduced to perform a similar function for the humanities. In general, the infrastructures for humanities research, and the funding of that research, have continued to fall behind the sciences, a pattern widely repeated in western democracies but of greater importance in New Zealand because of the negligible infrastructure or funding already established and provided before neoliberalism and business interests began to determine the postmodern shape of the knowledge economy and to define research priorities.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s1.43"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s1-43">6. Not so much an end, as unfinished</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The decision to bring the sciences and humanities together in one organisation could have turned out (and may still turn out) to have remarkably beneficial consequences. Knowledge creation and knowledge policy in the twenty-first century are dramatically different from what they were when “the two cultures” were identified by C. P. Snow early in the twentieth century. A single organisation capable of achieving an overview of this complex field would be truly innovative internationally. It would accomplish the equal representation of diverse and distinctive forms of research activity, from science and technology through social sciences to the humanities and the creative and performing arts, in the forms of knowledge characteristic of at least Western and Māori traditions and practices in Aotearoa New Zealand; it would recognise that research policy must include as an integral component policies for and investment in the conservation and transmission of knowledge, through cultural institutions, educational institutions, and public media; it would maintain an on-going review of the role of knowledge creation in the economy, and particularly of the relation between the twin principles of copyright and open access to publicly funded knowledge; and it would nurture the public interest in knowledge work of all kinds. It would provide policy perspectives on knowledge work which the inevitable departmentalisation of government agencies impedes. It is inconceivable to me that, at least in Aotearoa New Zealand, a single organisation could be created and funded to meet this extraordinary range of responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Those working in and for the humanities at the beginning of the twenty-first century are unable to match their deep conviction about the fundamental importance of the cultural knowledge they interpret and recreate for the present and future of the societies in which they live, and the apparent denial of value which public policies and funding regimes have entrenched. The hegemony achieved by science in Western countries, both as the default model of research and as the only valid source of knowledge for technocratic social management and policy formation, reverses the dominance in knowledge work once enjoyed by the traditional university arts curriculum. It is not surprising that, since the sciences evolved research methods which were, in contradistinction to the language- and text-based methods of the humanities, committed to producing the real as such uninflected by culture or perception, there should be a deep incompatibility of assumption and practice between these modes of knowledge creation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At the heart of these matters lies the need to articulate a new (democratic) politics of knowledge, one which is founded not on the given world but in the negotiations of human cultures with their inherited knowledge, the given world, and each other. Such a politics is present in the modes of thought developing under the aegis of postmodernity, whether in the sciences or the creative arts or the humanities. At issue is not a choice between methods or kinds of knowledge. If the task of the sciences is to formulate knowledge universals, the task of the humanities is to formulate provisional meanings and possible truths. The wonder of human existence lies in the astonishing diversity of knowledge created over the human centuries, and the human ability constantly to rework that knowledge in the process of learning to live productively with each other and our planet, which requires our care as the condition of sustaining our continued existence.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Reading around in the archive of documents which are the material remains of the national organisation for the humanities-aronui so many people had worked to build is like walking in a ruined city, where the idea of the city and the activities which sustained it can be imagined but the reality is fragments.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As I have noted at the beginning of this chapter, Ben Jonson’s play, <i>The Staple of Newes</i> (1626), by a humanist scholar deeply engaged in applying his knowledge to understanding profound change in the culture and society of his own time, provided for me a persistent backdrop to the work of institutional creation and social invention carried out over two decades with the aim of establishing the New Zealand Academy for the Humanities Te Whāinga Aronui and its successors, the Society and the Trust. Materialising ideas in organisational and semiotic forms means creating new information spaces which, once materialised, can only persist if sustained by three kinds of energy - mind, belief and money. It is possible to go a long way with only the first two, but without the third enduring social existence is not possible. The humanities are just as much “in the economy of capitalism” as any other body of knowledge, industry, worker, child or landscape. Furthermore, just as capitalism is caught up in the profound changes in the relations between societies, cultures, histories, economies, knowledge and media in the period of the postmodern, so are the humanities. A new humanities, coexistent with changing cultural, social and economic formations and capable of comprehending them, is taking shape in all the sites of cultural invention.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The rest of this book is an attempt to draw out the larger implications of what was attempted, in the hope that this analysis might provide another ground on which minds and beliefs (and even money) may come to converge and make the difference in Aotearoa New Zealand which was sought but could not finally be accomplished in the two decades bracketing the turn into the twenty-first century.</p>

Even though the rest of the statement does offer an extended paraphrase, I have “corrected” the phrase to read: “what it means to be human”.</p>
<p>What it is to be human signifies the possession of species-specific characteristics, whereas what it means to be human signifies the conceptions and beliefs humans have formed about themselves.

Council members who were employed in universities were already aware of this effect of the PBRF. It became increasingly difficult to find people who had a personal and intellectual commitment to the future of the humanities as a broad field of enquiry with critical social and cultural significance, and who could make any time available to contribute to the work needed at a national level.</p>
