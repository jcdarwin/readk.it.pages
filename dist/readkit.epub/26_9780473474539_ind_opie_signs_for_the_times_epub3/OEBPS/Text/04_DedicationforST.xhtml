<p style="margin-top:5em;">Dedication</p>
<p class="noindent1">This book is dedicated to all those who believe in the future of the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In particular, it commemorates Professor Jonathan Man√©-Wheoki, who was there from the beginning of
	HUMANZ and stayed until after the end, and Professor Mike Taggart, whose death was a grievous loss to the Council
	for the Humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">And it is an offering in love and gratitude to my partner, Anne, and our children, Rachel and Joss.
	Your humanity, your commitment to social justice and the value of intellectual endeavour, and your desire for a
	better future have sustained me in this work.</p>
