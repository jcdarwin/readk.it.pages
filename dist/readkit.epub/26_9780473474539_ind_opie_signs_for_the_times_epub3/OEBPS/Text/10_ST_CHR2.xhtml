<p class="noindent1">“We must not think to make a staple commodity of all the knowledge in the Land, to mark and licence it like our broad cloth and wooll packs” (Milton, 1644/1974: 226)</p>
<p class="noindent2">The period during which HUMANZ came into existence is the period marked by the ideological triumph of neoliberalism, a period unpropitious for the humanities in all Western countries. This is one indicator that, following the Second World War, a period of profound epistemic change was inaugurated, most hopefully manifested in the formation of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I align myself with those who adopt the term postmodernity to locate fundamental shifts in the dominant discourses and processes of subject formation of Western societies in the second half of the twentieth century, while having to acknowledge that it is the politically and ideologically conservative form of this shift which has now been imposed upon societies and cultures everywhere through supranational agencies using law and finance to override national settlements and redefine economic and social relations in accordance with commercial imperatives.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But this shift is evidenced in many other ways than through economic re-structuring. For me, the period comparable to the past fifty years is that of the Reformation, a period which saw a profound split in Western Christianity, which provided the truth system, the universities, the international language (Latin) and the international institution overarching the nascent nation states of Europe, the beginnings of the development of mercantile and city-based economies and imperial expansion, the formation of the modern conception of science, the advancing of democratic conceptions of government and society through revolution, and the development of a new information and communications technology, printing. It is the latter which served as a common enabling factor for all the others, just as new digital information and communications technologies are the common enabling factor in the new order of postmodernity. Right at this beginning, in a novel linking the seventeenth century to California in the 1960s, Pynchon (1965) had one of his characters in a fictional revenge tragedy, <i>The Courier’s Tragedy</i> (in which the early postal service is a significant component of the action) observe what is now blindingly clear in the global expansion of corporate media and information businesses and state intelligence agencies: “whoever controls the lines of communication, among all these princes, would control them” (113)<sup><a id="note1" href="#note_1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the Reformation also brought the modern humanities (in both its culturally conserving and critical modalities<sup><a id="note2" href="#note_2">2</a></sup> ) into existence, the period of postmodernity has produced, for the humanities and the humanistic social sciences, a variety of “turns” – material, cultural, linguistic, ethical, digital, speculative – in various ways meshed with a defining mark of the 1980s and 1990s, the culture wars. These various attempts to reframe humanistic thinking in Western democracies and challenge the modern settlement reached between academic humanities and the sciences (in Anglo-America if not in Europe), in which history and philosophy dominated because they, like the sciences, affirmed objectivity and rationality as their method and “the real world” as their object of enquiry, can also be seen as expressions of the politics inherent to knowledge work but typically obscured by scientific criteria for the creation of true knowledge. At the time of forming HUMANZ a succinct assessment of the intellectual and methodological challenges to the writing of history which had been elaborated during the twentieth century was published as the introduction to a collection of his essays by Roger Chartier. Drawing its title, <i>On the Edge of the Cliff,</i> from Michel de Certeau’s characterisation of Michel Foucault’s work, Chartier’s essays discuss the thought of a number of writers whose work has in common an attempt to shift how the writing of cultural history was conceived and practiced. He makes an observation which is of fundamental importance to any conception of a new humanities, and which it is the task of the second part of this chapter to elaborate: “Rendering intelligible practices that are not governed by the laws of the formation of discourses is a difficult, unstable enterprise poised at the edge of the void. It is always threatened by the temptation to do away with all difference between heteronomous but nonetheless interconnected forms of logic – the ones that organize utterances and the ones that command action and behaviour” (Chartier, 1997: 1).<sup><a id="note3" href="#note_3">3</a></sup> I will specifically take up the concept of the void in relation to writing and the formation of knowledge in <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a>; at this point what is most relevant to my concerns is Chartier’s succinct stating of the break involved in the passage from modern to postmodern history writing, when he asks:</p>
<p class="quote">What are the criteria by which a historical discourse – always a knowledge based on traces and signs – can be held to be a valid and explicative reconstruction (or at least more valid and explicative than others) of a past reality it has defined as its object? There is no easy answer to this question, even more so today than was true when the deep-rooted certitudes of critical objectivity and an epistemology of a coincidence between the real and knowledge of the real protected historians from all anxiety about its regime of truth. This is no longer the case. (9)</p>
<p class="noindent1">As Chartier writes of history in postmodernity, so it is true of government. The current dominant official model of knowledge production is technoscientific<sup><a id="note4" href="#note_4">4</a></sup> and is still based on “an epistemology of a coincidence between the real and knowledge of the real”, and the professional ethic governing the application of knowledge to the government and administration of society (including its knowledge institutions) is technocratic, both being in principle if not in fact apolitical and value free.<sup><a id="note5" href="#note_5">5</a></sup> The technocratic framing of its knowledge work disguises its inherently political character, policy discourse objectifying the social and cultural domains of governmental action and the apparently impersonal processes by which change occurs. To write that “This is no longer the case” is to recognise that postmodern relations between a democratic state, its publics and global institutions have become profoundly unstable, and that kinds of knowledge pertinent to government exceed technocratic limits.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A long retrospective can sometimes yield a clearer view of present complexities. It is easy to assume from much of the literature, and especially the self-representation of digital, networked ICTs by their manufacturers and promoters, that knowledge societies and innovation-led economies are very recent in their formation. In marking the advent of the city-based market economy in the seventeenth century, Milton observes in the epigraph to this chapter that market logic encourages the extension of commodity concepts from agricultural and industrial products to knowledge. Milton’s conception of knowledge after the Fall in <i>Paradise Lost</i> anticipates in astonishing ways what postmodern capitalist societies are now forced to recognise as the contradictory imperatives of economic growth (Hell) and ecological sustainability (Paradise). The creative technological imagination as that is formed by a combination of intellect, knowledge and the will to power over matter exercised through material instruments divorced from generational obligations and moral bonds is brilliantly anticipated in the character of Satan, and more recently re-imagined in in Monty Python’s representation of Satan’s fascination with technological futures in T<i>ime Bandits</i> (1981). Milton’s opposition in the name of freedom of thought to the more traditional controls over the circulation of knowledge exercised by the core early modern institutions of Church and State was focussed on reformation in religion, the formation of democratic citizenship, and the discovery of new knowledge through enquiry in every domain of learning. In the time of civil war he identified the city of London rather than the universities as the engine of new knowledge creation, and he drew an exact correlation between the freedom to think and the quality of government. Those arguing for censorship “doe as good bid ye [Lords and Commons] suppresse your selves; […] the immediate cause of all this free writing and free speaking [is] your own mild, and free, and human government” (1974: 240). At the heart of his defence of the freedom of the press (a defence which has not lost its political and intellectual force in the more than 350 years since the publication of <i>Areopagitica</i> in 1644) is the succinct statement of what a free mind requires of the State: “give me the liberty to know, utter and argue freely, according to conscience, above all liberties” (241). For Milton, it was print technology and its developing institutions which provided the equivalent of the internet as a channel through which individuals could address the public. But he clearly recognised the potential in the new system for creating and distributing knowledge for a new set of controls based not on “truth” determined by State institutions but on private ownership, both of content and the means of distribution. Several hundred years later, in the democratic societies which evolved in Britain and elsewhere out of the English civil war, a new “age of enclosure”<sup><a id="note6" href="#note_6">6</a></sup> has arrived, confirming Milton’s anticipation that particular interests will always seek to dominate and control the circulation of knowledge in opposition to the public good, which is served by open access to the knowledge accumulated and conserved socially throughout human history.<sup><a id="note7" href="#note_7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Another brilliant example of extraordinary prescience is the discovery and analysis by Milton’s older contemporary, Ben Jonson, of the birth of the new market economy and knowledge society within early seventeenth century London, and the integral role new and old social media were playing in its birth, which he brought to public consciousness in his play <i>The Staple of Newes</i> (1631) and to which I have briefly referred in <a href="09_ST_CHR1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter One</a>. Before the novel evolved a narrative form capacious enough to bring the complexity of the modern world into representation, or disciplined social scientific analysis took the place of literary, homiletic, historical and philosophical writing as the privileged source of authoritative knowledge about and critique of society, or television series like <i>The Wire</i> (2002-2008) and <i>The Bridge</i> (<i>Bron-Broen</i>, 2011-) exposed their viewers to morally and intellectually challenging explorations of the individual and collective complexities of postmodern urban life, Jonson used the theatre as a media technology to the same ends<sup><a id="note8" href="#note_8">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The play reveals how a city-based market would begin putting a price on access to information in response to demand, would invent new forms of organisation to manage this demand, and would reconceptualise knowledge and education in response to the perceived need for new kinds of expertise.<sup><a id="note9" href="#note_9">9</a></sup> The demand for information in the context of the invention of a new information and communication technology generated new forms of knowledge and knowledge organisations which had never previously existed, and which challenged the intellectual authority of the university and school as these were based on the content, training and modes of transmission characteristic of the traditional humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As though it were anticipating the excitement created in the late 1980s by the deregulation of the financial sector, the play opens with its principal character, Pennyboy Junior, about to come into his inheritance and so become independent of paternal authority. He gathers around him those of his own generation who will help him enjoy his wealth. In his case, although he does not know it, his self-knowledge is being tested by his father, Pennyboy Senior, who is believed to be dead but is present in disguise and ultimately punishes his son’s failure to distinguish between the goods of a city market-based consumer society and his moral duty to manage his wealth, not just spend it. In the process of working out this narrative, Jonson engages in an extraordinary exploration of the constitutive features of the new market economy and its social formations and values. He gets to grips with the problem of understanding the new social and economic order by taking knowledge organisations as his focus of enquiry; to this end he stages both a new medium and a new university, in both of which Pennyboy Junior invests. Jonson makes perfectly plain what humanities academics have tended to forget, that knowledge cannot be either conserved or created without public or private investment, and that access to that investment involves persuading those with capital to make such investments – in the play’s allegorical terminology, by forming a loving relationship with Lady Pecunia. In this respect, the question asked is, who should control wealth and knowledge and determine their social application? The postmodern answer would seem to be corporate technoscience and business interests; Jonson’s answer, proper to a social conservative of his time, was that the good father knows best.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The new medium is the newspaper, which is invented because there is a demand in the city market for current news. In this early recognition of the knowledge economy as a consumer economy based on the new, not the traditional, and on the socially useful, not the universally true, Jonson demonstrates that the news organisation is itself organisationally and culturally innovative. Those who set it up have the characteristics which have belatedly been captured by the term “entrepreneur”; they are members of the younger male generation who, lacking a fixed social position or wealth, open up a new social space for action and social influence governed by law, regulation and profit. But it also has features which mark it out as different from the traditional production of goods; as distinct from face to face communication, which is the traditional means of circulating information (“gossip”, in the play) the news is a textual product requiring money to gather, organise and disseminate, and to which access is limited by the ability to pay.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The College of Canters, the new university which Pennyboy Junior decides to found as a vigorous assertion of his belief that the new generation should have the means to materialise their vision of the future, is built on the same principle. Unlike the invisible college of the great writers and thinkers of the past from which humanism drew its authoritative knowledge, the professors of the College of Canters will be those who have useful knowledge derived from experience in the new economy based on trade, consumer goods, and knowledge which can be converted into products and activities with economic value. The characters of poet and herald perform the modern functions of public relations, celebrating and publicising wealth and social position; the lawyer is a money-manager working primarily for his own interest, the law being used to strategic effect; entrepreneurs raise capital in order to found a news business, a business which (like the university) evaporates at the end of the play when the capital is withdrawn.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Jonson was not an apologist for these new social and economic formations, but he made an extraordinary attempt to understand fundamental changes going on around him and to present that understanding to his society by means of the theatre<sup><a id="note10" href="#note_10">10</a></sup>. He believed that his audience (or the majority of it) would be attracted to the new, and hence open to exploitation by the merchants of the new, notably the newspaper and the consumer market of which it is a component, and the new knowledge of economic value (in trade, technology, law) for which the media system and university are the power centres. But he also knew, in contrast to the ruthlessness manifested in the recent crises of capitalism, that the control and flow of money by humane and socially responsible agents is fundamental to social harmony and justice.</p>
<p class="noindent1">His play consequently aims to expose what he perceives to be new economic and social forces at work in society which are destructive of morality, order and truth. These qualities are hidden for most of the play as characters model the heterogeneity of the city’s cultures, and their interactions in the free market make apparent its potential for innovation and profit; they are revealed only when the father strips off his disguise and regains control of his wealth at the end of the play – an ending by means of which poetic justice is authorially achieved even though Jonson has vividly staged the contrasting energies and beliefs of a new, urbanised generation. And then, as now, the plot trajectory is clearly an exercise in wish-fulfilment, since the flows of wealth are more potent and immediate in their social, political and personal effects than moral knowledge or commitment to social ideals like equality.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is refreshing to be reminded that contemporary conceptions of the knowledge society have long roots, quite predating the invention of digital ICTs, and that their current formulation in economic, institutional, technological and commercial terms represents a profound narrowing of their original scope in the set of ideas originating in civic humanism and represented here by Milton and Jonson (however contrasting their politics). The double imperative of human betterment through new learning and democratic participation in the governance of the nation, as it was expressed in the context of the industrial revolution, can be exemplified in a speech given to the Auckland Mechanic’s Institute by William Gisborne (1852: 3) on the topic ‘The Age We Live In”. The conviction and excitement about a future of progress and improvement in all aspects of human affairs deriving from new learning in science and technology is no different from the way in which business leaders and parliamentarians speak now about the importance of a research-driven economy; what is different is the set of ideas which give shape and social purpose to the accumulation of knowledge:</p>
<p class="quote">One of the great characteristics of the present age is the strenuous effort made to disseminate knowledge among the masses of the human race, and to facilitate their mutual intercourse. [,,,] It is difficult justly to speculate upon the fall of nations; but it has sometimes struck me that, among other reasons for the decay of those once eminent nations, in whose lands we now find proofs of former civilisation of a high order, was the fact of this monopoly of knowledge on the part of a small minority, and this want of it on the part of a great majority. Learning, wealth, and power may nourish for a time among nations where knowledge is confined to a few,— where the flow of its living waters is artificially banked up, but I hold it impossible for such nations long to remain prosperous, and long to keep the lead in the course of civilisation. This system of mental restriction is essentially false, and carries in itself the cause of its fall. The pyramid rests upon its apex, and not upon its base. […] As the commerce of nations creates material wealth, so are the treasures of learning best secured by the free commerce of mind and mind. Knowledge ought to know no monopoly.</p>
<p class="noindent1">And, in case the link between communications technologies, the collapse of distance, and the centrality of knowledge to human evolution is supposed to be a distinctive recognition of the late twentieth century and the product of digital ICTs, Gisborne is worth attending to again:</p>
<p class="quote">Every mental faculty is now exerted to accelerate locomotion, to bring together the most remote portions of the globe, and to facilitate, in the highest degree, the inter-communication of man and man. And this brings me to the great means which now exist, and materially aid in the attainment of these objects, — the general education and rapid intercourse of the human race. Means, which form the grand feature of the present age. — Printing, Steam, and Electricity. These are the three powerful genii of modern time, — whose wonderful achievements and strange transformations far transcend the miracles of their fabled predecessors. The barriers of time and space are being swept away.</p>

<p class="noindent1">The cluster of ideas informing this account is anchored by the term civilisation, understood as the ongoing achievement of a democratic society with open systems of communication, in which the human resources of knowledge, intelligence and creativity are liberated by education to serve long-term collective social and moral ends. The present contraction of this broad conception to economic development is succinctly indicated by collapsing the metaphor of treasure in the previous quotation, “learning” becoming a commodity like any other and valued only as a source of material wealth.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This contraction of thinking and its deep social and cultural implications was analysed in (for me) a seminal study of the new information age from a position in academic literary and cultural studies. Alan Liu described the desire which motivated his <i>Laws of Cool</i> as a desire to “write about the fate of the knowledges for which I cared most deeply – historical, literary, artistic, <i>humane</i> knowledges – in the new, brazen world of information” (2004: 385; emphasis in the original). He observed that “knowledge work is not simply indifferent to humanistic knowledge, it opposes it on principle. [From the mid-1990s] competing models of knowledge work, once rooted semi-autonomously in academic, business, media, health-industry, government, and other sectors, suddenly seemed to fuse into a single, parsimonious continuum – so-called ‘worldwide’ – able to afford just one global understanding of understanding” (6-7). Through a close historical analysis of the interrelated evolution of information technologies, the organisation of work, the worker subject of knowledge work, and corporate culture through the phases of automating, informating and networking, Liu demonstrated just how complex the social and cultural changes of the past half-century are, and how central to them is the global reach of, and interaction between, information technologies and postindustrial corporations. Culturally, while all cultures are different, “to the extent that all cultures want to achieve productivity and profitability, they will end up being quintessentially American. Mainstream American culture, in other words, gets to be both a distinct cultural identity (Yankee practicality and problem-solving) and something universal” (59). Critical to the indifference to humane knowledges is an association between history and obsolescence: “Instantaneous, simultaneous, and on-demand information is the engine of the post-industrial ‘now’” (8). In this new order of knowledge work, with its mainstream of technical, managerial, professional and clerical workers (8, and Appendix A: Taxonomy of Knowledge Work) and its emphasis on life-long learning, Liu asked, “how will the academy adapt to its diminished role as one among many providers in a potentially rich and diverse – but also potentially impoverished and culturally uniform – ecology of knowledge?” (22). One part of his answer is by being subsumed within the roles the information economy provides; the other is by turning the principle of creative destruction against “what is most valued in knowledge work – the content, form and control of information” (8). By turning the concept of creative destruction against its corporate application to boundless innovation, its “other side” being “the equally ceaseless destruction that produces historical difference” (8), a version of the hacker character can recover to the humanities and creative arts a critical and creative role in what is otherwise becoming a unitary and global knowledge order determined by post-industrial corporate culture. Liu argues that “Knowledge work and information culture must be evaluated by the measure not just of individual weal or national wealth but of global commonwealth. The important question is: what standard of well-being might emerge from the seemingly closed circuit of well-informed citizenry in the West that can transform the U.S.-led vision of a world as all ‘global competition’ into a less fundamentally cruel imagination of wealth in common?” (287).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Official and public conceptions of the value of knowledge once possessed a humanistic breadth of reference. The dominance of corporate culture and technoscience as the knowledge of value in late twentieth-century democratic societies has brought about a contraction of this breadth and the marginalizing of the traditions of inherited knowledge in these societies and their methods of enquiry.<sup><a id="note11" href="#note_11">11</a></sup> It has also dramatically changed the status and functions of the institutions which were developed to administer the inherited stocks of knowledge and to disseminate and build on them, notably universities, libraries, archives, and media. I intend to consider the institution of the university primarily in the remainder of this chapter, and cultural or memory institutions and media organisations in subsequent chapters. In each case, the question of the interactive relationship between specialist professional and generalist public knowledge will be taken up as a question about the work of knowledge in a democratic society, when creativity and innovation have become the terms framing this work in public policy.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s2.1"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-1">1. Re-thinking the Humanities and the University</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">If the objects originally investigated by the sciences are those constituting the heterogeneity of the given world, including ourselves, the objects investigated by the humanities are those constituting the archive of humanity’s collective knowledge. Two ideas foundational to these investigations and elaborated by them over time are the ideas of nature and humanity. As ideas, “nature” and “humanity” have complex histories (including the history of their relationship) and carry powerful ideological, cultural and political loadings. For Derrida, “ The old question about what is specifically human needs to be entirely reworked. Not only in relation to the life sciences, not only in relation to what is called by that general, homogeneous, and confused word, ‘the <i>animal</i>,’ but also in relation to all the traits that metaphysics restricted to humans, of which <i>not one</i> is resistant to analysis”. Humanity is therefore “a problematic concept”. Like human rights, “both as concept and as reality it is still, for the most part, to come” (2005a: 104, 107). To formulate such concepts anew and to revise previous formulations of them is the distinctive work of the university, however it is also distributed across society. It is in the academic humanities, as in the academic sciences and social sciences, that the most advanced methods for thinking about the complexity of life on Earth are developed, applied, critiqued and revised by intellectual work. The question motivating this book is, what is it that is distinctive about the humanities, and about the current dominant conception of the character and purpose of knowledge, which has led to their marginalisation – in universities, government, and the public sphere - in the performance of this fundamental function in advanced societies?</p>
<p class="noindent1">The institution of the university exists to locate a society’s advanced knowledge capabilities within the global spectrum of knowledges. It therefore differs in two important ways from research institutes, whether publicly or privately funded, and from organisations representing specific domains of knowledge, whether as professional bodies or organisations in the public sphere. Firstly, it perpetuates a commitment to make access to the whole of human knowledge locally available in some representative way; and, secondly, it is required not only to advance knowledge but to educate new generations in its understanding and social uses. Having these purposes, and marked by its history and location, each university is a singular institution, even though this singularity continues to be challenged in policy and practice as universities are required to respond to market imperatives, knowledge priorities and claims on public resources of global business and finance, and the governments advancing those interests.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The academic humanities are an array of textually and disciplinarily constituted domains of knowledge, the ordinary work of which is the recollection and interpretation of parts of the textual production of a culture, with the aim of assisting that culture’s more complete self-understanding. Over time, the parts taken to be of value have become more fully representative, but there is still much which is not normally included in teaching and research. To achieve the highest level of abstraction and codification appropriate to academic knowledge work, the academic humanities employ a range of investigative and interpretive techniques and theories appropriate to the semiotic objects providing the material equivalent of the objects of the given world for the scientist. As a domain of knowledge, the humanities came into existence together with the invention of writing and cities<sup><a id="note12" href="#note_12">12</a></sup>, and they exist in an interdependent relationship with writing technologies (media) of all kinds.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The humanities are nonetheless granted only token value in the present era of neoliberal and technocratic valuations of knowledge because both the method and object of research – textual interpretation and the universe of knowledge created by humanity throughout human history – are not regarded as productive of certain knowledge or knowledge of significant economic value. Whatever the claims one might want to make about the affirmation in postmodern humanities of uncertainty and indeterminacy as a constitutive factor in knowledge creation, transmission and reception, it remains the case that this attempt to bring the academic humanities into an association with their proper materials and methods in a manner relevant to the cultural contexts of the twentieth and twenty first centuries has not enhanced perception in the Western university of the humanities as knowledge creators.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To question this state of affairs in the name of the humanities is not an effect of a nostalgic desire for the return of the traditional university. Quite the contrary. More than any other social institution, the university must not only react to changes in its environment, but it should be anticipating those changes by creating the knowledge needed to understand and shape them to good ends. While this new knowledge may be of global significance, one might think that the reason why a particular society or nation would invest in a university is so that its citizens can achieve more of <i>their</i> goals for the future of <i>their</i> society through being well-informed about the challenges facing it and them and the possible ways of thinking through these challenges to socially inclusive, productive solutions. From this perspective, most universities are local institutions whose task is to interpret global knowledge into their localities, and to modify and advance that knowledge as an effect of its further development through interpretation, testing and application in a distinctive social and ecological environment. At present, however, as a consequence of the universalist model of scientific research and the neo-imperialism of global corporations and their complementary supranational institutions, universities are typically expected (and now expect themselves) to be engaged in research according to programmes and criteria established by the most scientifically advanced nations, where the “international” standards for evaluating and rewarding research are set.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At present, the humanities disciplines which are regarded in the humanities as of most value are those which can be positioned adjacent to the sciences: history and philosophy, and those aspects of other humanities disciplines which employ empirical methods and digital technologies in research. The first text of literary theory in English, Sir Philip Sidney’s <i>An Apology for Poetry</i> (1595), anticipated this situation by opposing poetry to history and philosophy as modes of formulating and communicating knowledge (See below, <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a>). In the same way, in developing my case I will privilege my own field, the least disciplined of humanities fields, English Literature (but meaning by that to embrace the study of aesthetic texts in all media, including performance, print, still and moving images, music, mass media, digital media), because the principal objects of study are fictions. But creativity and innovation are currently understood by governments and universities to be attributes of science and technology, with the creative arts retaining their traditional claim on creativity and being regarded as innovative only in the context of industrial media production and the markets for art<sup><a id="note13" href="#note_13">13</a></sup>. In this account, the humanities have no recognised claim to either attribute, and this is one reason why their place in the twenty-first century university is increasingly marginal.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It would seem, then, counter-intuitive to consider the question of the postmodern university from the perspective of the humanities. But it is exactly this line of enquiry which must be followed through if the humanities are to redefine and reassert their role in fundamental knowledge creation. Derrida has pointed the way in his discussion of a new or transformed humanities, the humanities to-come, and his view that “the space of the new Humanities […] will not let itself be contained within the traditional limits of the departments that today belong, by their very status, to the Humanities” (2005b: 13). The humanities to which he refers are kinds of knowledge “capable of taking on the tasks of deconstruction, beginning with the deconstruction of their own history and their own axioms” and extending to embrace “everything that concerns the question and the history of truth, in its relation to the question of man, of what is proper to man […] without condition and without presupposition” (12), and linked to “the question of literatures, to a certain democratic institution that is called literature or literary fiction” (16)<sup><a id="note14" href="#note_14">14</a></sup>. This new humanities is for Derrida the most complete manifestation of “the university without condition: the principal right to say everything, whether it be under the heading of fiction and the experimentation of knowledge, and the right to say it publicly, to publish it” (13-14). Milton made the same affirmation when he sought from government “the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely, according to conscience”. The whole work of thought, its dependence on the moral integrity of the individual, and the importance of its public dissemination is here contained within and linked together by the concept of liberty, but it is important to emphasise that this condition of liberty for thought and argument is not a fact of social nature; as with Derrida’s “right to say” it is a gift of the state to be confirmed in law and social and political practice. Without that gift, the institutional space of the university contracts and becomes a colony of those with social and financial power.</p>

<p class="noindent1">In his reference to publishing Derrida recognises both the issue of “the marketplace in publishing and the role it plays in archivization, evaluation, and legitimation of academic research” and the importance of making that work public by finding “the best access to a new public space transformed by new techniques of communication, information, archivization, and knowledge production” (12). The university without condition is a unique institutional space within society “in which nothing is beyond question” (13), including its own principles and axioms and the ways in which it categorises and administers knowledge. Its research work is open and public, disciplined in intellectual method but lacking policed disciplinary borders, a human invention with the fundamental purpose of enlarging our conceptions of what it means to be human, or, put another way, the idea of humanity.<sup><a id="note15" href="#note_15">15</a></sup> To be open to the possibility of a humanities to-come is to be open to humanity to-come; as Douzinas (2010: 71) has argued, “History has taught us that there is nothing sacred about any definition of humanity […] Its metaphysical function lies […] in the incessant surprising of the human condition and its exposure to an undecided open future.” From this conception he draws a conclusion which has extraordinary resonance now as ethnic nationalism takes hold across the world, affirming that the postmodern role of Law and the Humanities is to be found in “resistance to the biopolitical turn of post-political politics and culture. The duty to resist places the university (Law and the Humanities) in opposition to many and great powers, which include the nation, the state and its sovereignty, and those mediatic, ideological, religious and cultural forces that stop and prevent the cosmopolitanism to come” (71). But the Western university as an institution is now at least as deeply enmeshed in the interests of global economic powers and the elites directing nation states as it was previously in the interests of the Church and dynastic families in pre- and early modern Europe.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Two quotations will serve to relocate the grounds for the humanities in and beyond the university. The first is from Kim Stanley Robinson’s novel <i>2312</i>, which foregrounds the intimate and fundamental role of language in creating new possibilities of thought and perception, and the human universality of this role:</p>
<p class="quote">To form a sentence is to collapse many superposed wave functions to a single thought universe. Multiplying the lost universes word by word, we can say that each sentence extinguishes 10<sup>n</sup> universes, where <i>n</i> is the number of words in the sentence. Each thought condenses trillions of potential thoughts. Thus we get verbal overshadowing, where the language we use structures the reality we inhabit. Maybe this is a blessing. Maybe this is why we need to keep making sentences (2012: 550]</p>
<p class="noindent1">Robinson’s assessment of language is apparently negative, emphasising the loss of potential in the act of forming a specific sentence and the persistence of past structures of thinking into the present; but since the process of “making sentences” is a universal human practice, it points as well to the means built into language not only for formulating, communicating and recording what has been thought, but for venturing beyond those completed sentences in multiple and unpredictable ways into what has not yet been thought or given intelligible form. If attention is shifted from the work of the writer to that of the reader, the interpretive work of the reader can also be seen to be generative of possibilities of meaning not foreseen by the writer.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The second observation is made by Rauna Kuokkanen in her powerful critique of the Western university from the perspective of indigenous knowledge. In the introduction to her analysis, she locates herself in a very specific cultural, geographical and linguistic context:</p>
<p class="quote">The Deatnu, regarded as one of the best salmon rivers in Europe, is considered the border between Norway and Finland. For many of us along the river, the Deatnu is not a border but rather a bond that connects the families who live on its banks. […] I want to start by situating myself with the Deatnu – a river that runs through my home in Samiland. […] The Deatnu’s fluid, shifting nature defies clear, fixed boundaries. This ambiguity is the river’s strength, which cannot be reduced to binary oppositions. Literally, the river – both as a physical entity and as a concept-metaphor – demands that we look beneath the surface […] Cultural and linguistic mingling has a long history along the Deatnu and is still taken for granted by many local people. […] Communication along the river takes place in various languages, and there are always people who do not understand all of the languages spoken. This is entirely normal (2007: ix-xii).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The common experience affirmed in this example is of communication over time between people in languages not universally understood, in which languages and cultures reciprocally draw from each other but do not cancel each other out. Like the river, languages and cultures however disseminated are embedded in a specific place through time, and exceed the forms and limits imposed by dominant social groups, laws and economies, just as the object of any discipline exceeds the rules which from time to time govern the formulation of knowledge in it and the use of language to express and record that knowledge.<sup><a id="note16" href="#note_16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">What I want to sketch here about the coordinates defining the new space of the humanities in the university to-come is embedded in these statements, and is readily highlighted if the Deatnu is taken as a concept-metaphor for language. The interactivity between universes of thought in formation, formal knowledge, and cultural identity which is effected and sustained by languages in their localities and across times and spaces is both the substance of the humanities and the vital source of creativity in human societies. If the humanities can be properly recognised as giving presence in the university to the plenitude and mingling of languages and inherited cultural knowledge and, through interpretation of this knowledge in its many languages, as generating new worlds of thought, then they may provide a means for grasping what systemically could make it possible to locate creativity as well as reason at the core of the postmodern university.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Texts flow from the past into the present and the future. Opening this chapter with discussion of a poem and a play from the early modern period has a strategic purpose. It is partly to make an obvious point that nonetheless needs to be made, that there are very few thoughts which are absolutely unique and have no precedent, and the related point, that writing from the past, and from fiction, can offer powerful perspectives from which to analyse the present world order and form arguments to shape policies for its humane evolution. It is also to highlight the fact that all knowledge has indigenous origins and is inevitably inflected by culture.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The modern intellectual orientation of creativity and innovation is powerfully evoked in the titlepage of Bacon’s <i>Instauratio Magna</i> (1620), containing the <i>Novum Organon</i>. In physical space, a ship sails towards the reader, moving from a circumscribed to an open domain without coordinates<sup><a id="note17" href="#note_17">17</a></sup>. The columns marking the boundary across which the ship is about to sail emphasise that the boundary is humanly created and not naturally imposed. But the means to breach the boundary are also humanly created, signified by the technology of the ship which is also a figure for the media which transport knowledge from one time and place to another. By placing the reader in the unfixed (aporetic) space connecting the present to the open/the future/the possible,<sup><a id="note18" href="#note_18">18</a></sup> the image challenges readers of the book similarly to place themselves outside the familiar boundaries of the known world. In adopting that position, readers are nonetheless placed by the orders of knowledge (the universe of mind) of which they are bearers and by which their minds are formed, just as the technology which enables their movement (literal and virtual) into that space is also what it is, of its time and place.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There is obviously another meaning of the image, the ship representing imperial Europe employing then advanced technologies to extract material value from the new world and literally ship it back to the old. It is that meaning which underpins the current dominant concept of innovation, in which outcomes are ranked by their market value to the rights owners rather than their public, social value. The first push of (European) imperial expansion was to create wealth wherever land could be controlled by farming and mining the world’s natural resources and shipping the products back to the home countries; the second is an apparently metaphorical replay of the first, to create wealth wherever knowledge could be appropriated by farming and mining the world’s informational and cultural resources and transporting the products by various technological means to global markets and the profits to those who owned the processes of extraction, production, and distribution.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Just as Bacon’s thinking was conducted in the context of the structural challenge to the hegemony of inherited knowledge (classical and Christian) represented by the Renaissance and Reformation, and marked the inauguration of modern science, so postmodern societies have been brought to the same point of crisis by hegemonic knowledge, in our time by the association between science, technology and business/finance capitalism. Humanity needs a new Novum Organon, one which thinks the humanities with Derrida’s inclusiveness or, as another example, with Alain Badiou’s conception of philosophy as conditioned by four generic procedures: love, art, science and politics. As he writes, “What happens in art, in science, in true (rare) politics, and in love (if it exists), is the coming to light of an indiscernible of the times, […] that which detains in its multiple-being all the common traits of the collective in question: in this sense, it is the truth of the collective’s being” (2007: 17). To think of the task of intellectual work in the humanities as revealing to a human collective that which has not yet become apparent in their thought about themselves, and also as illuminating previously unexplored dimensions of the idea of humanity, is to bring all knowledge, in all times and places, within the scope of humanities enquiry and to centre that enquiry on the question, what (more) does it mean to be human (than humanity already understands)? It grants a value to thought itself as a way and a means to valid knowledge and truths.</p>

<p class="imagecaption">Illustration 1: Bacon, <i>Instauratio magna</i> (1620), titlepage.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">A compelling example of work which argues for a new Novum Organon is Bonneuil and Fressoz’s <i>The Shock of the Anthropocene</i> (2016). Accepting that the Anthropocene marks a point of no return in the relations between humanity and the given world, they show “how this forceful, even violent, return of the history of the Earth into world history creates a new human condition and requires us to reintegrate nature and the Earth system at the heart of our understanding of history, our conception of freedom, and our practice of democracy” (20). Performing this work, that is, conceiving and understanding the Anthropocene. “requires a new environmental humanities. For this strange species, the ‘naked ape’ that has plunged the Earth into the uncertain future of the Anthropocene is not simply a biological entity. It is made up of social and ideological systems, institutions and imaginations, pervaded by power relations that govern an unequal distribution of the benefits and ravages of Gaia, of legitimacy in speaking <i>of</i> and <i>for</i> the planet, and of the possibilities of influencing technological and economic choices” (44). Among other things, therefore, humanity needs a new environmental humanities fostering dialogue between the humanities and the sciences, politics and history “on the geological scale” (67, 80), “redefinition of what it is to be human” (93), and the invention of “a more sober civilization” (21). If this seems an impossible task, Bonneuil and Fressoz ask their readers to note that “The wealth of humanity and its capacity for future adaptation come from the diversity of its cultures, which are so many experiments in ways of worthily inhabiting the Earth” (72).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Two other studies which make explicit in different ways what is at stake for the humanities in enquiry oriented towards understanding what is becoming of humanity are Hayles’ <i>How We Became Posthuman</i> (1999; see also Hayles, 2005) and Fuller’s <i>Humanity 2.0</i>. (2011). Both place their studies in historical contexts, specifically histories of the ways “the human” has been conceptualised; both engage fully with the technoscientific direction of postmodernity and specifically with the concept and programme of transhumanism in its anticipation through biotechnology of the merger between humanity and its machines; both engage in what Fuller (92) calls “textual interpretation” as a method in both the social sciences and the humanities; both accept that "humanity’s nature is forever fugitive” (Fuller, 102); both draw upon a particular resource for thinking beyond the materials of techno-science and philosophy, and it is here that their most striking difference in approach becomes apparent. For Hayles it is speculative or science fiction; for Fuller it is theology.<sup><a id="note19" href="#note_19">19</a></sup> If Fuller (70) believes that “’social science’ is losing its salience” because ”the humanities and natural sciences are rediscovering their common historic interest in <i>human nature</i>, with stress now unequivocally placed on ‘nature’ rather than the ‘human’”, Hayles (24) hopes that her book will demonstrate “how crucial it is to recognize interrelations between different kinds of cultural productions, specifically literature and science. […] The scientific texts often reveal, as literature cannot, the foundational assumptions that gave theoretical scope and artifactual efficacy to a particular approach. The literary texts often reveal, as scientific works cannot, the complex cultural, social, and representational issues tied up with conceptual shifts and technological innovations.” For both (and as Fuller unambiguously states in the full title to his book), the focus of analysis is humanity’s cultural productions – humanity’s “thought” in all its diversity of cultural and historical origins and textual forms – through the question, what does it mean to be human? and the shifting horizons of the idea of humanity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Hayles presents her work (which I am presenting as an instance of a new humanities in action) as a “way of understanding ourselves as embodied creatures living within and through embodied worlds and embodied words” (1999: 24). The concept of a new humanities, and the university without condition, which Derrida has advanced under the aegis of the “to-come” presents a complex and urgent challenge to the present, but also lays the groundwork for thinking about the future.<sup><a id="note20" href="#note_20">20</a></sup> I will approach the relation between the humanities and the postmodern university from four directions:</p>

<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>by providing a sketch of the conceptual coordinates by which “the space of a new humanities” can be demarcated;</p>

<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>by giving a name to the university to-come.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s2.2"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-2">2. The Humanities in and out of Knowledge Policy</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The New Zealand Government, among other Western democracies, may be unique in the completeness of the erasure of the humanities from its conception of knowledge work and what constitutes knowledge of value. Traditional conceptions are endorsed, through awards to authors of fiction and non-fiction, life-time achievement awards to artists, and the funding of “creative research” through Creative New Zealand, but the cultural sector is not integrated into government policy or funding for knowledge creation. The use of terms like “creative industries” and “cultural industries” obscures the fundamental question of the nature and value of the knowledge work which is characteristic of the cultural sector and especially of the academic humanities, which is its most abstract and theoretical dimension. It also obscures the profound dependency of the humanities on public conservation of society’s texts, in archives, museums, galleries, libraries and their digital extensions. The objects held in these collections are characterised by their heterogeneity - of forms, media, languages, time and place of composition, and cultural purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To accept the claim of ANY discipline or specialism as having a unique capacity for innovation is simply to accept the conventional politics of knowledge in which, as in the ordinary political domain, claims to rule are based on social and economic power and the maintenance of disciplined social boundaries. But innovation is an outcome of an orientation towards knowledge in any domain, an outcome of a state of mind (individual and collective), a poetic process<sup><a id="note21" href="#note_21">21</a></sup> by which some aspect of the potential or the possible comes within the range of human perception, comprehension and experience. Innovations have positive value and meaning when they assist humanity to understand and live better with themselves and the given world.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The relations within knowledge which have had the effect of marginalising the humanities are political, not essential, and therefore not permanent, even though the ongoing entrenchment of science and economy as the primary concern of democratic governments makes it difficult to perceive how and when a constructive re-balancing might take place. My aim is to present a local perspective on the global processes of change impelled by the ideological imperatives of neoliberalism as a set of doctrines about knowledge of value, the processes of its creation and consumption, and the subordinated roles of government to the market and the public to the private sphere.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Throughout the period during which HUMANZ was active, I contributed to submissions on policy issues and wrote a number of papers for conferences and seminars analysing some of the key texts which both defined and expressed the new (that is, postmodern conservative) policies which were fundamentally revising inherited conceptions of the role of democratic government and the public institutions tasked to accomplish that role on behalf of the public interest. I critiqued New Zealand’s policies for research, research assessment and tertiary education in the context of endeavouring to insert a claim for consideration of the humanities into a technoscience-dominated conception of knowledge (Opie 2004), and have described the Performance-Based Research Fund, (the name for New Zealand’s research assessment exercise) as an exemplary instance of public sector innovation, even though New Zealand’s neoliberal governments have been unable to factor public sector agencies into their conceptions of research, the knowledge society, and innovation policy (Opie, 2009b). The point of these critiques was to demonstrate how tertiary education policy, governance and funding in New Zealand was discursively reconstituted during the 1990s and after according to the now very familiar neoliberal principles of research as scientific research, quantified assessment of research outputs, technoscience-led innovation, commercialisation of knowledge, and education for employment, and the marginalising of the humanities which accompanied these reforms.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Since those papers were written, there has been further, major reorganisation of government ministries in New Zealand. So dominant is the influence of the private sector that the previous independence within government of the two principal branches of research and learning, the agencies respectively representing the science and technology sector and the arts and culture sector, have been wholly or partly “integrated” into larger ministries. The most important is the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment, in which science and technology, economic development and public research funding are located; the National Library and National Archives are now part of the Department of Internal Affairs, rather than the Ministry of Culture and Heritage; and Education remains outside both of these groupings, reaffirming its problematic situation which is the result of its fracturing between knowledge creation (as research) in tertiary education, education for employment, and education for living in a democratic society and the postmodern world. But the critical point is that it has not been possible for New Zealand governments to build a knowledge policy and its strategic development, funding and implementation on a coherent and integrated conception of the role of knowledge in a postmodern, democratic society. The redirection of government is consistent with the premises on which neoliberal policy is formed, and profoundly reductive as a representation of how knowledge works in a democratic society, even if it suits business and financial interests. I will take up this matter further as it concerns cultural institutions in <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapters Three</a> and <a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Four</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The discussion of the Two Cultures initiated by C P Snow still has currency<sup><a id="note22" href="#note_22">22</a></sup> and, in contrast to some, I believe that the distinction needs to be heightened rather than dissolved in order to avoid misrecognition of foundational features of a postmodern society’s knowledge system. The attempt to make the “two cultures” disappear by assimilating the humanities into the Anglo-American technoscience system for managing knowledge creation, for example, by adopting the term “human sciences” from Europe, has to be resisted.<sup><a id="note23" href="#note_23">23</a></sup> It is not that knowledge creation is carried out in hermetically sealed domains, but that fundamental differences in object and method constitute two complementary and overlapping worlds of mind.<sup><a id="note24" href="#note_24">24</a></sup> The science system is distinguished by: its “given world” objects of research (which includes the human species); the search for universals, by experimental methods and quantification; its progressive conception of the discovery and obsolescence of knowledge, and the power of that knowledge when applied to materially transforming the given and social worlds; the commercial contexts in which its knowledge is valued; and its imperial tendency to assume or require communication in one dominant language. There is no aspect of this list to which the humanities can properly conform, however much current dominant policies for research evaluation and funding have required the academic humanities to conform themselves to bureaucratic technologies of measurement and evaluation based on the science system. Assuming universality for the research methods, practices and institutional formations which are specific to technoscience dislocates the work of humanities research; the historically evolved, learned and internalised structuring of the former fails to mesh with the historically evolved, learned and internalised structuring of the latter. But, as Hartley (2012: 36) observes, “the distinction between the humanities and the sciences is itself dynamic.” <sup><a id="note25" href="#note_25">25</a></sup> What needs to be recognised and properly theorised in policy work is the multiplicity of knowledge cultures within the frames of the two worlds, and the dependency of the effective social, cultural and economic adaptation of any society to its existential conditions on the quality and openness of the interactions between them.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Specifically in relation to the humanities, it is important to ask what have been the effects of introducing scientific criteria and methodologies for knowledge formation, especially objectivity, universality, quantification and a language restricted to denotation, into the domain of non-scientific knowledge formation, if it is the case that those criteria and methodologies have limited application to the objects of and purposes for knowledge creation in that domain. The issue is not whether scientific approaches to knowing can contribute to the creation of culturally valuable knowledge, but whether they can be properly taken to provide a universal model for knowledge creation and hence the definitive means of discriminating between valuable and other kinds of knowledge. Translated into the work of state organisations, the issue is how those organisations, having responsibility for the management of the whole of a society on behalf of that society as it is represented in Parliament, on the one hand, and by its publics, on the other, come to establish priorities in the allocation of public funds for different kinds of knowledge work. It is clear that the dominant technocratic discourse of government, grounded in the social sciences but typically abstracted from their qualitative, historical and theorising dimensions, is both universalising and unable to accommodate forms of knowledge which do not conform to the requirements of that technocratic discourse.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is also clear from recent government policy papers that this discursive structure is as firmly entrenched as ever, despite the fact that New Zealand never seems to quite make the transition to the technoscience-led, world-ranking innovative economy promised by the repeated policy initiatives. In particular, comparative measures with other “advanced” nations continue to show an apparently stubborn refusal by the New Zealand economy and its knowledge society to conform to “international” criteria, even though New Zealand universities seem to be doing well in international ranking systems. In my view, the misrecognised core of the problem lies in New Zealand’s history as a colony of a global empire. New Zealand universities were initially conceived as colonial institutions, presenting the curriculum of the imperial nation to first degree level; advanced study and research in any field required travelling to the United Kingdom for that purpose. The New Zealand economy was designed to serve the needs of the imperial society. In effect, as the horizons of advanced knowledge have expanded at an exponential rate, and economic globalisation has imposed new demands on its population, New Zealand has not been able to transcend that colonial status, and is now under the imperial or neo-colonial sway of other “international” knowledge and financial systems, notably the United States and Europe and the supranational institutions of the global financial system.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Not that this is how analysis of New Zealand’s deep difficulties in conforming to international models is being presented by the government. <i>The Draft National Statement of Science Investment 2014–2024</i><sup><a id="note26" href="#note_26">26</a></sup> is disarmingly explicit (and tunnel-visioned) about the knowledge needed for both economic growth and policy formation: “New Zealand’s economic and social wellbeing depends on the productivity and competitiveness of our economy and the knowledge we have to make informed decisions as a society. Science provides that knowledge and informs those decisions” (4). This assessment has been replicated in policy documents trying to imagine and generate a certain kind of knowledge economy in New Zealand for at least two decades regardless of the political disposition of the government, as has the local obstacle facing scientific and technological R&amp;D:</p>
<p class="quote">New Zealand is a small, geographically isolated economy. This limits access to physical markets, scale of industry, and the financial and human resources we have available. […] New Zealand’s economy is characterised by having a comparatively small number of large firms. Both domestically and internationally, larger firms have access to the scale, capital, and ability to manage risk that enables them to invest proportionally greater amounts in R&amp;D. New Zealand is also the location for relatively few multi-national companies, which tend to be the largest investors in R&amp;D. Finally, New Zealand also lacks at significant scale the sectors that tend to invest most in R&amp;D, such as defence and pharmaceuticals (11, 20).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put another way, the evidence offered overall by the <i>Draft National Statement</i> (but not, of course, discussed in this way) is that the policies of the past twenty years have not made the positive difference claimed for them (there is no doubt that they have worsened the situation of a large portion of New Zealand’s population, as in most other democracies), but our policy makers have no way of thinking differently in public (whatever might be available to them within the privacy of thought and conversation within governmental organisations). There is little evidence in New Zealand of official thinking that does not simply replicate downloaded models from northern countries with powerful financial, industrial and technoscientific infrastructures, relation to which the defects in this country’s performance can be measured and policy and funding remedies proposed. Even when the examples are smaller nations within Europe, the contrast between the intensity of relations between European countries and New Zealand’s relation with the Pacific Ocean is stark.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The presence of Creative Commons, mātauranga Māori and the humanities in the <i>Draft National Statement</i> cannot be taken as indicative of a shift in thinking about knowledge policy and its embeddedness in the technoscience system; like references to culture and society, they have the effect of the accidental revealing of fossils by a flood. Their absence from and lack of modifying effect on the core components constituting a national policy for knowledge as this is set out in the <i>Draft National Statement</i> and its companion document, <i>Tertiary Education Strategy 2014-19</i>, is both startling and yet the current culmination of a two-decades long process, with no obvious end in sight.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Both documents, in other words, show that conditions militating against policy strategies are in effect unchanged from those identified two decades ago, with the effect of locking the country for another decade into more of the same failure. The only apparently conceivable response is more restructuring, more pressure to achieve conformity to international comparative measures, more degrading of the role of public sector agencies, more public investment in the science-technology-business nexus, more concentration on the role of education for approved kinds of employment; in other words, a command economy which is supposed to be driven by creativity and innovation. A valuable counter to this way of thinking is offered by Stehr (2005: 194-195), who observes what is also the case in New Zealand and has been most recently foregrounded in the controversies over the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA):</p>
<p class="quote">Market economies evolved in different times and in different places within contexts of different national laws and policy styles, cultures and social structures, constitutions and policies. Whether these diverse patterns are bound to surrender to a common global logic of capitalist production and exchange is therefore a contentious assertion. […] economic transformations cannot easily be uncoupled from cultural and political contingencies and traditions. […] Existing disciplinary divisions with the social sciences contribute to masking the significance of the interdependence of cultural, political and economic forces […] Disputes that involve the cultural impact and consequences of globalization remain the most intense and bitter controversies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One would think that the fact that “New Zealand faces unique challenges” (20) would be an incentive to develop unique solutions. Instead, to take one example from the period of intensive reform of tertiary education (discussed in Opie, 2004, 2009a), a 2006 report produced by the New Zealand Vice Chancellors’ Committee (NZVCC). Throughout the reform process, the NZVCC made determined representations to the government concerning the threats to the integrity of the university as a distinctive component of the New Zealand knowledge production system from the changes being made to the funding and administration of tertiary education. Central to the NZVCC’s conception of the issues was the shift of a significant proportion of the funding for tertiary education from the universities to the polytechnic sector and private training institutions, and the need to reverse it. The document which marks the success of the universities’ argument is <i>An Investment Approach to Public Support of New Zealand’s Universities<b>.</b></i> This submission to the review of tertiary funding benchmarked the funding of New Zealand’s universities against other OECD countries. The picture it painted was stark: one table showed that total income per EFTS in New Zealand universities in 2004 was US$11,690 in comparison to US$21,490 for the United Kingdom. Another compared total income per EFTS among some <i>Universitas 21</i> members and New Zealand universities in 2003-4. Auckland University of Technology was lowest at US$8,060, followed by Victoria University of Wellington at US$9,069, with Lincoln University at the top of the New Zealand group with US$15,065. The top United Kingdom member, the University of Edinburgh, was on US$29,137 and the only United States member, the University of Virginia, was on $US49,410. The submission eloquently enforced the point that New Zealand universities could not compete internationally if that competition were determined by funding levels. The disparities were great on every measure, which reinforced the NZVCC case that much more of the available tertiary funding should be allocated to the universities over the polytechnics, specifically for research. In a moment of disarming wish-fulfillment, the NZVCC went to the heart of the contradictions in knowledge policy and its implementation in New Zealand by asking rhetorically: “what could be achieved by New Zealand universities, and by the nation, if the level of investment was increased to something approaching international norms?” (13).</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.3"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-3">2.1 Modes 1-3</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">One particularly important source of analysis which informed the knowledge policy work of HUMANZ was a work on science policy by Michael Gibbons et al., <i>The New Production of Knowledge. The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies,</i> published in 1994). Gibbons et al offered a very timely analysis of deep changes in the conception of knowledge creation, and was also a powerful challenge to the conventions underpinning policy formation for knowledge creation. While primarily addressing science policy, in arguing for a fundamental shift of mode, from discipline-based (Mode 1) to problem-based (Mode 2) research, the writers placed the humanities in an intriguing perspective. Unlike most analyses of the knowledge society, they argued that the humanities have, in some respects, always possessed the characteristics of problem-based research, which they defined as transdisciplinary, heterogeneous, and reflexive. Furthermore, “In terms of […] other Mode 2 characteristics - the generation of knowledge within a context of social application, greater social accountability, and quality control no longer determined by scientific quality alone but including wider criteria - the humanities have always been forerunners. Rather than the humanities being pre-scientific, it is the natural sciences which until very recently have been pre-social” (99). This contrast is a good example of how the humanities and cultural knowledge production more generally are considered by Gibbons et al in the context of recent and major changes to conceptions of and demands upon scientific and technological knowledge. At the heart of the matter is the view that “The current postindustrial transformation of the economy is also echoed by what has been labelled postmodernism in culture and the humanities [although] cultural activity gives rise to very different visions and responses” (108). Given their anxiety about “demoralising relativism” (102) as an outcome of postmodern critique, and a sense that the humanities are “quizzical commentators who offer […] a diversion from threatening complexity and volatility” (110), Gibbons et al nonetheless place the critical theory work and cultural production of the humanities of the past five decades in their proper context, as signs and consequences (like Mode 2 knowledge production in the sciences) of “the emergence of a radical new socio-economic order” (110).</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is worth listing the main factors connecting the humanities to Mode 2 knowledge production as Gibbons et al define them because, together, they constitute a heuristic and therefore provide a strong means of further demonstrating how knowledge work in arts, culture, and humanities differs from that in the sciences and why policies towards research and innovation are seriously compromised by adopting an account which takes only technoscientific knowledge creation as its model<sup><a id="note27" href="#note_27">27</a></sup>. These factors are:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>in the humanities and social sciences ideas and social practices have always been intimately related (99);</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the intellectual values [of the humanities] are inevitably shaped by their social context and application (99);</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the separation from politics which the natural sciences strove to maintain over centuries and which the humanities and social sciences were never able to enjoy (100);</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>arts disciplines have always lacked the robust construction typical of the sciences. […] Philosophy, history, literature and the others are much more loosely organised, professional microcultures held together by intellectual affinity but also marked by contradictory, even conflicting, interpretative communities (100);</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>reflexivity has always been a traditional characteristic of the humanities in the sense that their intellectual energy comes from the ceaseless interrogation of the past by the present (100); and,</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>reflexivity [in the humanities] is expected to carry meaning for the entire human experience, to enrich the domain of signification (105).</p>
<p class="noindent1">These factors, taken together, substantiate a view that the modern humanities, however they have been defined to themselves or to others, have inherently always already been postmodern - in Barnett’s terms, characterised by uncertainty, unpredictability, challengeability, and contestability. It is to claim and give a positive valuation to these attributes that a new humanities is needed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Gibbons et al’s analysis of the humanities is powerful because the factors they adduce capture the multiple double binds in which the modern academic humanities are entangled. To assert the right to be considered disciplines in the Mode 1 sense of the modern university, the humanities adopted the methodological values of scientific research even though that did not persuade scientists or governments that the humanities were sciences in some form, a process of misrecognition which Gibbons et al describe as “scientification” and which is well understood otherwise in colonisation studies as mimicry. It is then more than ironical that the rejection of postmodern humanities by much of the established academic humanities workforce has had the double effect of blocking the evolution of the humanities as a form of postmodern knowledge and of entrenching their defensive claim to value as Mode I-type disciplines. The adoption of the terminology of scientific research by the humanities is the most evident sign and effect of knowledge politics in the modern university. But it is accompanied by the irony, marked most obviously during the reform of public sector research and research funding in the 1990s, of the common cause established between scientists whose research was “pure”, that is, did not easily fit into a framework of commercial application or strategic priorities, and humanities academics whose work did not fit into any government or scientific view of economic priorities or social value. Hence it can be hardly surprising in New Zealand that the only administrative space to which the humanities has gained access for external research funding is the Marsden Fund, the selection principle for which is research excellence.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Gibbons et al account for the interrelationship between the humanities and cultural production by defining the humanities as the “intellectual representation” of culture. The analysis in the chapter, ‘The Case of the Humanities”, points to a highly interactive account of the relations between creation and interpretation as modes of knowledge production, especially in the attribution to the humanities of reflexivity and immersion in “the creation of values and signification” (93, 105), and the role of cultural production in the economy:</p>
<p class="quote">There are two reasons why this rapid growth of cultural production is a less celebrated phenomenon than the parallel explosion of scientific knowledge. First, it is assumed, wrongly, that its connection to wealth creation is much weaker. In societies where basic material needs have been largely satisfied, cultural consumption, and so production, have become increasingly significant forms of economic activity. The cultural services sector is an especially dynamic component of the modern economy […]. Second, cultural production is apparently less costly, certainly in the restricted form of scholarship in the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But Gibbons et al go on to argue that, even if one focuses on mass media cultural production, “the economy of culture […] is distinct from those of leading-edge scientific and high-technology industry”; taken as a whole, the knowledge created in cultural production is diverse and heterogeneous, a characteristic reflected in another way in the fact that humanities disciplines “have always lacked the robust construction typical of the sciences. […] disciplinary frontiers have always been more permeable in the humanities.” They note that it has been “a tempting option” for humanities practitioners to make the humanities and cultural production more generally fit the criteria for discipline formation and knowledge production legitimated by the academic sciences. The effects of this misdirection are magnified at a time when the shift from material to cultural production necessitates a quite different account of the work of knowledge producers whose materials and contexts of production are social and cultural.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A decade later, Gibbons observed that “a new language is required to make sense of what is going on in the research context” (Gibbons, 2004: 111) – but such a language is still not evident in New Zealand policy documents. He also drew a conclusion about postmodern knowledge which is directly relevant to the fundamental principle of quality assessment which officially justifies research assessment exercises. One of the other features of Mode 2 is a change in the methods used for quality control in knowledge work, which is required because “clear and unchallengeable criteria to determine quality may not be available. Instead, we must learn to live with multiple definitions of quality, which seriously complicates (even compromises) the processes of discrimination, prioritisation and selectivity on which policymakers and funding agencies increasingly rely” (99). One of the most important criteria currently employed to assess quality in research assessment exercises is the form of publication or dissemination of research, and especially the ranking of journals, a criterion challenged by arts and humanities representatives because it privileges the modes of science publication (Arts and Humanities Research Board, 2003: 10; Council for Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, 2005: 68-69). Gibbons et al suggest a positioning for this discussion which goes to the heart of the issue of the relationship between writing (the formation and publication of thought), purpose and social transformation when they identify the essay as the distinctive form in which humanities knowledge work has traditionally been carried out: “Essays [the preferred genre of the humanities] – one of the oldest forms of Mode 2 production – roam freely in the territories seemingly held by the specialisms, link together what would otherwise remain fragmented analyses; they are, at their best, an art form highly conducive to the construction and dissemination of meaning” (106) - but not currently to success in research assessment rankings.<sup><a id="note28" href="#note_28">28</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Gibbons et al’s analysis has been considerably extended by Caravannis and Campbell (2012) with the concept of Mode 3. In its full development, this conception of a knowledge system producing innovation through the complex interaction of heterogeneous agencies and actors opens out the discussion of the nature of knowledge societies in directions which are consistent with my argument for the role of the humanities in such social formations. By insisting that an adequate analysis of innovation must include democracy, culture, media, civil society and the environment, Caravannis and Campbell go a long way towards shifting the discussion of innovation away from its currently privileged locations in science, technology, finance and the economy. However, although the humanities are included as a conventional component of academic knowledge work (15), the context for this acknowledgment is a discussion of the critical role of creativity in advanced knowledge societies, for which the arts are the example, and artistic research is proposed as the complement to research in the sciences, even though the relationship is not worked out. In a phrase which points towards my later discussion, especially in <a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4</a>, but also maintains the current equation of science with knowledge, they write that “The sciences are a manifestation of knowledge, but also the arts, <i>at least partially, can be understood</i> as a manifestation of knowledge” (15, my emphasis). The awkward placing of the arts, and the effective absence of the humanities, in the reconceptualisation of the fields of postmodern knowledge, the knowledge work of universities, and policies for innovation is identified by that italicised phrase.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.4"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-4">2.2 Positioning Critique</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The documentation on the evolution of public policies for knowledge and critical responses to them is enormous, part of the multiplication being the consequence of the formation of national policies which have tended to obscure the common structure informing them. But to engage with knowledge policy formation on behalf of the humanities requires engaging with the forms of discourse in which this policy work is conducted, and with the politics and ideologies framing knowledge policy. It requires a productive estrangement from the aims, purposes and discourses of modern academic humanities. As Douzinas (2010: 71) has argued, “The stakes are no longer or exclusively the development of the delicacy of discernment, the sharpening of hermeneutical aptitude, or even moral edification”; a new humanities must include in its discursive repertoire familiarity with the discourses of government and the critical discourses capable of analysing and interpreting them.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I will refer here only to four critiques related specifically to the modern Western university which can stand for my own positioning in what is a highly politicised situation. The first, Slaughter and Leslie’s <i>Academic Capitalism</i>, provided a deeply thoughtful and early warning of what was to come in the reshaping of universities according to neoliberal principles. This study analysed developments in four nations, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States and, presciently, does not reference the humanities in the index. But one of its conclusions precisely defines the basic shift in resource allocations on which everything else has depended: “technoscience fields gained resource shares while fields that were not close to the market, such as philosophy and religion, foreign languages, letters and performing arts, or fields that served the social welfare functions of the state, such as education or home economics, lost shares” (1997: 211). In this situation of arm’s length manipulation of the value of different kinds of knowledge through funding criteria and quantified methods of evaluating research productivity, the struggle between winners and losers became intra-institutional, and the meaning of the term “university” increasingly became the property of the central administration and its public relations section, rather than its academic workforce.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The second, Max Haiven’s, is an impassioned confirmation of that analysis from the experience of one who has graduated into the tainted opportunities offered to the most advanced minds in the humanities by the neoliberal version of the postmodern university. He describes himself in a chapter on the edu-factory as “a precarious academic worker, which means that, though I have a Ph.D. and a reasonably good record of publications and academic accomplishments, I am unlikely to get a permanent academic job that would afford me some measure of job security, let alone safety from disciplinary measures should I say or write something that offends the powers that be” (2014: 134). He points up the deep irony in a situation where governments have proclaimed the advent of the knowledge society and yet their policies serve to devalue knowledge work, tying the most highly educated segment of their population into debt and insecurity.<sup><a id="note29" href="#note_29">29</a></sup> In his account, the university is “not merely an example of new forms of discipline and exploitation; it is a laboratory. […] While the best aspects of university curricula try to radicalize our idea of responsibility (how are we responsible to one another? to society? to the earth? to the public? to the commons? to our privilege? to our community? to animals, plants and the climate? to power and to resistance?), these efforts run up against and fly in the face of a broader economic agenda through which the university becomes a factory for producing austere subjects: individuals whose sense of self and of possibility is finely calibrated to the capitalist values of accumulation, competition and individualism ” (140, 148-9). For Haiven, hope in this situation lies in our collective ability to imagine differently, “to dream of and build towards different social horizons […] based on the (always provisional and negotiable) values of solidarity, equality, individuality, empowerment and peace” (257-8). His book deliberately refuses to be judged according to the criteria for advanced academic work in the humanities; as Haiven puts it, “It is not an attempt to offer a systematic theory, only to present my own fractured, incomplete, idiosyncratic thinking to the common imagination” (27). A text of the new humanities, in other words, the means by which a singular mind addresses other minds wherever they are located in a process of thinking through to new orders of social life.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For New Zealand, a politically consistent and discursively evolving critique can be tracked through the work of Michael Peters in authored and edited analyses of the complex issues in public policies for knowledge and their wide implications for society as a whole. His writing exemplifies the interpenetration of knowledges required in new humanities work, the theoretical grounding and inherently political character of critique, and the formation through conferences, meetings and publication of a globally distributed community of enquiry which is attentive to the specifics of local contexts. Consistently, his work returns to education as the critical social institution through which a society’s new citizens are disciplined to satisfy the requirements of the neoliberal economy, but where they might also learn how to imagine themselves and their world differently. Latterly, together with others he has challenged cognitive capitalism by propounding the concept of the creative university as a means of locating an alternative set of values for higher education.<sup><a id="note30" href="#note_30">30</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Each of these analyses of the profound changes undertaken in and by Western universities during the past three decades emphasises how the Western university is being reshaped by imperatives over which it has little or no control. To reverse this state of affairs requires that universities (being, as I have proposed, first and foremost local institutions) redefine what makes them distinctive as public institutions in a democratic society, and give value to the multiplicity of social environments in which their knowledge work plays a significant role. A new humanities is clearly one consequence of such an approach, since it is not possible to reintegrate the university without rethinking the diverse kinds of knowledge it professes and what brings them together in this institutional formation. A compelling analysis of what is at stake here is offered by Barnett who argues in <i>The University in an Age of Supercomplexity</i> that “The new university that is not doomed to repeat the past (viz., the modern university) and not committed to making the mistakes of the present (viz., the neoliberal university), might be called, for lack of a better term, the ‘postmodern’ university” (2000: 22). The basis for this renaming is four concepts which he takes to characterise postmodern societies and therefore the conditions under which individual subjectivity is formed, institutions now operate and knowledge work is carried out: uncertainty, unpredictability, challengeability, and contestability (68). Supercomplexity is the combined effect of these qualities, in all domains of life, exemplified by what he calls the “discursive maze” of postmodern knowledge: “The global age spawns continuous reframing in culture, work and life more generally. It is this continuous reframing that produces supercomplexity in which all our frames of understanding are challengeable” (144).<sup><a id="note31" href="#note_31">31</a></sup> For Barnett, the postmodern university will become a “pivotal institution precisely through its insight into the character of this world and through the human capacities it will sponsor to confront that world […] creativity accompanied by critique” (69). I have analysed the conception of research which has informed New Zealand government policy papers (Opie, 2009b) and its focus on and promotion of research-led innovation as new (scientific) knowledge leading to new products of economic value, which fails to account for humanistic knowledge and therefore to give it value. Barnett argues that this kind of discrimination is political (148), and proposes instead that the most important distinction within knowledge work is whether the outcomes are paradigm-endorsing or revolutionary (145); the former he regards as the common mode of academic work, whereas the latter is the now necessary mode, with continuous reframing both of expert knowledge and public understanding as the principal outcome. On the basis of this distinction he repositions scholarship, meaning the reviewing and re-interpreting of existing knowledge, which is not conventionally thought to create new knowledge (although this is how most new knowledge is created in the humanities). The university “has a role to shed light on the manifold accounts that exist. This role has tended to be known as scholarship, an activity that becomes crucial in offering us new interpretations of the already existing accounts“ (70). For it to become crucial, scholarship must escape introversion – the university’s tendency to “conduct inner conversations of the elect” (71). The possibility of new forms of knowing exists as much in the heterogeneity of the records of human thought as it does in the hypotheses and methods of scientific research.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><u>The</u> question, as Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen framed it at the launch of the Humanities Trust in 2005, is “whether society exists to serve our economy, or our economy exists to serve society.” Replace “society” with “university” and the deep challenge to the role of the university as the institution charged to carry out professional knowledge work on society’s behalf is not the economy, but society. Not only is it necessary to challenge existing paradigms of thought framing advanced research, but there must be a full engagement with the public, offering interpretations of the significance of new knowledge so that the members of society as a whole can purposefully and constructively reframe their understanding of the world in which they are living. “Research-led teaching” could be one example of this work of critique and dissemination, one mode of the democratisation of knowledge, but not if most research endorses rather than challenges current paradigms, so that teaching is the transmission of what is already known rather than an opening on to what is yet to be known. The work of independent scholars is another. Just as the arts and humanities are in effect positioned outside research in knowledge society policies, so is much knowledge creation across the disciplines accomplished in formal and informal spaces outside the university by people with varying degrees of formal research training (from doctorate to amateur). There is a strong case (Finnegan, 2005) for public policies for knowledge creation to recognise this aspect of “socially distributed knowledge production” (Gibbons, 2004: 99) because it plays a critical role in the elaboration and circulation of a democratic society’s resources of knowledge. It is axiomatic to my conception of a new humanities that innovation draws fundamentally from the open circulation of knowledge throughout a society, and it is therefore necessary to recognise the contribution of non-academic organisations (think-tanks, NGOs, professional bodies, churches, government agencies, community groups) and non-institutional knowledge workers (independent scholars and researchers) to the advancing of knowledge, as well as to engage academic humanities fully across this spectrum of modes of dissemination, communication, and use of knowledge. A helpful term for such knowledge work is “public scholarship” (Cummings, 2005: 176), much of which is distinguished from academic research in the modern university by being produced in public spaces and for public use and which bears the marks of the postmodern knowledge order – “fluidity and contestation, […] plurality and dissolving identities” (Barnett, 2000: 273). This socially dispersed rather than institutionally concentrated research capability needs particular attention in public policy; it may be a distinguishing aspect of New Zealand’s knowledge society, especially when considered in the light of Gross’s statement that “A society based on brain power, on good new ideas, no longer can rely on one sector (academe) or on a specialized subunit (the R&amp;D divisions of companies) to produce new knowledge. It can and must harness the intellectual capacities of a far wider section of its highly educated and mentally adventurous work force” (Gross, 1982). While the internet is promoted as the democratic medium of knowledge exchange, and is contributing to the enlargement of the scope and character of public scholarship, there is a countervailing tendency, which is that access to resources for advanced research is increasingly closed to those lacking formal institutional affiliation because of the ownership rules governing the use of digitised knowledge and the costs of access to it, even when that knowledge is publicly funded (Finnegan, 2005: 15; National Library of New Zealand, 2007: 27, 30). Educational institutions have a crucial role to play in sustaining this public component of a society’s capability for knowledge creation.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s2.5"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-5">3. A New Humanities Research System</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">From the beginning of the effort to establish HUMANZ, the issue of the lack of representation of humanities knowledge work in official statistics, together with the distribution of public sector agencies across the knowledge field, was a critical stumbling block when addressing government and seeking to influence policy. The idea that there could be a humanities research <i>system</i> integrating the creation and application of humanities knowledge throughout society was simply absent. In a time when quantification is a fundamental aspect of public discourse, it is impossible to give an adequate account of the importance of humanities knowledge when aspects of the economy and society in which this knowledge has value and effects are not counted together. Some examples are publishing, education, tourism, government, diplomacy, trade, design, fashion and entertainment. What they have in common is heterogeneity, of languages, methodologies, locales, cultures, histories, institutions, media, ways of thinking; new ways of accounting for them have to be devised [Hunter et al, 1991; Bennett, 2013). The concepts of cultural and public value (Holden, 2004; Bennington and Moore, 2011) point in a productive direction.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.6"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-6">3.1 In the International Domain</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">In countries with established national organisations set up to represent the humanities (unlike New Zealand), governments have been required to attend to very articulate and well-researched reports on the value of the humanities which reflect the particular policy pressures of the time in which they were written. While the rhetorical skill and conviction of these reports is impressive, they were clearly insufficient to turn public knowledge policies from technoscience, business and their incessant public promotion towards a more balanced conception of the cultural, social and economic roles of knowledge. It is more likely that these organisations will have seen their claims to value undermined, but they have been defending a position already established rather than, as in New Zealand, attempting to modify policies developed without a tradition of representation and advocacy from outside the university system.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Many very substantial studies of the status and role of the arts, humanities and social sciences have been made during the past two decades by organizations representing these fields of knowledge, under pressure from the same ensemble of policies which have been articulated in New Zealand and the conceptual framework which informs them. These studies (for example, American Council of Learned Societies, 2006; Arts and Humanities Research Council. 2013; British Academy, 2004, 2005, 2008; Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences, 2005; Council for Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, 2005; Hassan et al, 2008; Matthae and Birzer, 2004; Turner and Brass, 2014; UNESCO, 2014; Harvard Faculty Working Group, 2013; Working Group on the Future of the Humanities, 2001) have been occasioned by declines in funding, the relentless marginalising of the humanities in government policies for knowledge, the exclusion of these fields from the official accounts of innovation and knowledge of economic value, and by the dominance of technoscientific conceptions of knowledge work in the design and functionality of digital ICTs, most especially now in the area of research using high performance computing.</p>
<p class="noindent1">All of these texts seek to reassert the proper claims of the humanities (and arts, education and social sciences) to having social and economic value, in ways appropriate to them and the kinds of work they perform in and for society. They are also strongly marked by the informing assumption of government policies, that research is typically scientific and the value it produces is achieved through industrial and technological applications. Each text can be analysed closely for the different balance of forces and interests which provide national contexts for their composition and audiences. All I will do here is to identify several positions which these texts share, in order to indicate that the matters of concern to me are being fully engaged in other similar jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The British Academy (2004) report directly takes on the question of the economic value of knowledge in its title while challenging a narrow interpretation of the term:</p>
<p class="quote">The arts, humanities and social sciences also make key (and as yet underappreciated) contributions to the economy, and facilitate wealth creation in a wide range of tangible and intangible ways. Moreover, research findings have shown that capitalist economies function best and with greatest stability under certain political and cultural conditions, and it is to the provision of these conditions that arts, humanities and social science teaching and research markedly contribute (62).</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is repeatedly critical of government policies for knowledge, stating, for example, that “The language and concepts used by government to encourage the development of research and innovation are often derived unthinkingly from now outdated assumptions that seriously impeded the full exploitation of the arts, humanities and social sciences, and the information they yield” (ix, 65) – even while itself using a key term for corporate and state appropriation of natural and human resources. All of these reports make positive claims about the modes of knowledge work which are characteristic of the humanities, like this from the Canadian Working Group: “The actual social, cultural and intellectual relevance of work in the humanities, as in many of the social sciences, lies […] in an ability to articulate the significance of cultural and historical events. Humanities research does not, generally, produce quantifiable results. What it does produce is explanatory models and rich and nuanced interpretations of complex questions. Unlike the experimental scientist in the laboratory, the humanist cannot isolate a single variable: he or she must take into account and endeavour to make sense of the awesomely complex and splendidly messy facts of human existence” (18-19; American Council of Learned Societies, 2006: 8). All of these reports emphasis the effects of underinvestment. The particular importance in respect of the on-going development of the digital informational and communicational infrastructure on the basis of a partial (that is, technoscientific) model of knowledge work is brought out in the ACLS report, where it is affirmed that “the online world is a new cultural commonwealth in which knowledge, learning, and discovery can flourish” but only if it develops as “an online environment that cultivates the richness of human experience, the diversity of human languages and cultures, and the full range of human creativity. Such an environment will best emerge if its design can benefit from the strengths of the humanities and social sciences: clarity of expression, the ability to uncover meaning in even scattered or garbled information, and centuries of experience in organizing knowledge” (American Council of Learned Societies, 2006: 2).</p>
<p class="noindent1">There was one very significant (and, in the event, poignant) parallel to our situation in New Zealand. During the 1990s, when those involved with HUMANZ were trying to establish a national humanities organisation and gain government (and sectoral) recognition for it, the British Academy was trying to gain government agreement to the establishment of a Research Council for the Arts and Humanities, the missing segment of academic knowledge in the United Kingdom’s research councils’ structure and funding. The first attempt failed, but led to the establishment of The United Kingdom Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB), which subsequently wrote <i>The Arts and Humanities: Understanding the Research Landscape</i> following the successful establishment of a research council for the arts and humanities in 2003. This report was initially directed to the other research councils, all of which were science-based. Its premise was that “research in the arts and humanities has tended to become marginalised in national debate [over the past fifty years], and its character and importance only partly understood outside its own domain.” The report also observed that</p>
<p class="quote">the arrival of the arts and humanities within the structure of the research councils and the OST [Office of Science and Technology] must not imply that research in these disciplines should be supported only insofar as it engages with current science agendas, though it clearly has the capacity to do that. The enlargement of the research councils and of the OST’s domain means that these must now embrace and support the wider range of subjects and imperatives which constitute the arts and humanities research. It is not a matter of the arts and humanities simply fitting into the existing research landscape, but about reconfiguring the research landscape to include the distinctive concerns and priorities of the arts and humanities as well as those which they share with the disciplines currently within the OST.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In striking contrast to traditionalist views which regard the introduction of theory into postmodern humanities (aka the culture wars) as having damaged the reputation of the humanities within and outside the universities, the AHRB placed theory work at the heart of humanities research, affirming that “theoretical and conceptual approaches […] are themselves a contested terrain. Such contests are in many disciplines the core mode of intellectual engagement and discourse, and they constitute a key engine for analytical creativity and for advancing knowledge” (2.2; Matthae and Brizer, 2004: 4; Delanty, 2001: 147-150).</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have commented elsewhere {Opie, 2009b: 179-182) on the relative richness of subject specification in the PBRF panels for the sciences, and the meagre representation of the humanities. Another way of underlining this point, which exemplifies the presence to the policy mind of the organisation and elaboration of the sciences and the corresponding absence of the humanities from that mind, is to quote in full a list given by the authors of the AHRB report which set out “a range of subjects and themes of research [which] lie within and across disciplinary boundaries, and […] are reconfigured and renewed in just the same way as within any areas of science research, as the analytical problems and the theoretical and methodological approaches change.” The list deliberately challenges the conventions of academic description by discipline and points compellingly towards a framework for a new humanities:</p>
<p class="quote">Organisation of knowledge<br/>Epistemology and evidence<br/>Language and the character of expression, translation and communication<br/>Media and communications<br/>Cognition, perception and understanding<br/>Consciousness<br/>Ideas, thoughts and beliefs<br/>Subjectivity<br/>Reading texts and images<br/>Narrative and discourse<br/>Representation<br/>Transmission, reception and appropriation<br/>The present as process<br/>Institutions and the construction of power<br/>Culture and identities<br/>Mobility, exile and diasporas<br/>Humans and the historic environment<br/>Creativity, expression and composition</p>
<p class="noindent1">While recognising the lack of an adequate infrastructure for arts and humanities (5.4) which “have not benefited from the increasingly important role of the research councils and the associated expansion of research activity which have been characteristic of the sciences” (1.1), this report took the commendably strong position that the work of the arts and humanities is of equal importance to that of any other research domain because of its “distinctive modes of access to and understanding of human experience and activity” (2.3).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The terms through which a powerful set of policy positions relevant to the large fraction of knowledge work in New Zealand which is unaccounted for in current technoscience-based policy statements could be articulated are set out here. But the first step that is required in order to engage with the current set of cognitive and social practices shaping knowledge policy and begin the process of repositioning it is to specify the terms of “the multiple definitions of quality”, which in New Zealand would include at least those locating the distinctive characteristics of knowledge creation in matauranga Māori, the arts, culture, education and humanities. In other words, what is needed is a conceptual grounding for knowledge creation as the collective work of a whole society and as a public good. What follows here will attempt to identify the components of such a grounding.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.7"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-7">3.2 Configuring Knowledge Creation in a New Humanities</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">I have already discussed in <a href="09_ST_CHR1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter One</a> the definitions set out in <i>The HUMANZ Research Policy</i> (1996) and employed by HUMANZ when representing the case for humanities research to the New Zealand government. A key point to recollect is that, following the post-colonial turn in Aotearoa New Zealand’s constitutional thinking, the recovery of the Treaty of Waitangi (which formalised the relation between the Māori people and the British Crown in 1840) reframed this nation as bi-cultural and bi-lingual. This meant, in principle if not in practice, that “New Zealand humanities” could no longer be only “settler humanities”. The name given to this hybrid was humanities-aronui: “The humanities-aronui are that body of knowledge and those modes of enquiry and reflection which concern what it is to be human<sup><a id="note32" href="#note_32">32</a></sup>, including our inhumanity and our relation to the non-human,” with the qualities of being diffusive, accumulative, and value-laden. The aim was to delineate the features of a distinctive mode of thinking and knowing which extended throughout society and culture and was not located only in universities or defined by specific discipline formations. It was also designed to make it absolutely clear that attempting to conceive of the humanities-aronui in policy (research, knowledge, economic, educational, cultural) by analogy with the technosciences was unfeasible. Appropriate conceiving of the purposes and scope of public sector and media organisations, and cultural and memory institutions, the role of the humanities-aronui in society and the economy, the nature of the productivity of knowledge in the humanities-aronui and its relation to the arts, the law and the technosciences, would depend upon a multi-dimensioned, not unitary, approach to the generation, circulation, use and value of different kinds of knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Re-thinking the position of the humanities in the postmodern knowledge order requires a category capable of including all those objects (linguistic, mathematical, graphic, imagistic, musical, performative, architectural, technological) which are marked by signs and can communicate information, knowledge and meaning to (some or many) interlocutors and interpreters. It also requires a conception of the humanities as a mode of knowing active throughout a society, not only in its current disciplinary form of the academic humanities. I will draw on a number of exemplary studies in order to establish the parameters of the “space of the new humanities”. These will provide terms for the modes of knowing constitutive of the humanities, the objects studied in the humanities and what is characteristic of the space these objects and the work done with them occupy, and defining features of the objects making up the resource for humanities enquiry. As Chartier so succinctly put it, knowledge creation in the humanities follows a common path “which leads from the archive to the text, from the text to writing, and from writing to knowledge” (10), and, he might have added, back to the archive again, which now expands to include a new text and so is no longer the same.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.8"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-8">3.3 Conceiving Worlds of Knowledge</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">In <i>Paradise Lost</i> Milton linked the invention of technology directly to the challenge posed to intelligent beings by a world of inorganic or lifeless matter (now the problem posed by the worlds of the other planets in our solar system), in contrast to human residence in knowledgeable harmony with all other living things in the biosphere of the Garden of Eden. Each world generated its specific kinds of power/knowledge, a situation strongly marked in the postmodern as life sciences and ecological thinking now propose alternative conceptualisations of the world we live in and our human place in it to those formative in modern science.</p>

<p class="noindent1">A work which provides a most helpful account of the nature and evolution of knowledge pertinent to thinking about the new humanities is Søren Brier’s <i>Cybersemiotics</i>, in which the life and information sciences are the principal resource for a theory of knowledge grounded by a strong conception of what it means to be human and an integral part of the spectrum of life on Earth.<sup><a id="note33" href="#note_33">33</a></sup> Brier observes “the modern humanities in their divided specializations and often highly refined aestheticism [to be] standing in weak opposition to financial power joined with a scientific–technological system. The humanities have difficulty finding a common ground on which to formulate their value assumptions, since they wish neither to make ethics into religion or science, nor to define human nature beyond socio-linguistic material consciousness” (2008: 82). He also observes that “The natural sciences […] work towards making one grand historical explanation from matter over life to consciousness and cultural meaning”, but argues instead for a “new paradigmatic foundation that would enable us to integrate the knowledge of the study of embodied consciousness from the exact, as well as the life sciences, the social sciences and the humanities, without reducing one set of results to another” (2013: 230). While cybersemiotics might not immediately recommend itself to academic humanists as providing a common ground on which the weakness of the humanities in relation to the sciences could be addressed, Brier’s argument for the necessary existence of multiple and incommensurate modes of knowledge and his founding of a general theory of knowledge on a theory of the sign provides a powerful incentive to consider it closely.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This is even more so when he affirms that “culture, mind, meaning, consciousness and ethics […] are all natural phenomena inside nature”, invoking Merleau-Ponty in support (2013: 238), and that “we must look for a theory that allows evolution and mind to be parts of foundational reality” (2008: 433). As with other writers whose thought I am engaging to my purposes, Brier is impressive for his perception of connectedness among very different domains of knowledge, and the principles according to which he interprets his findings. He, too, is working with a belief that humanity is in a period of fundamental change, and this provides a generous motive for his work:</p>
<p class="quote">I believe in the need to consciously construct and discuss basic philosophical perspectives, and to contemplate the limits and possibilities of human knowledge and the place of the sciences in it, as a means to develop and optimize the common good in civilizations […] to expand the dialogue between sciences, the humanities, the social sciences, philosophy, and the existential quest to broaden our concept of reason in accordance with my stance towards making common frames for the open and systematic pursuits of knowledge and meaning. […] we stand at the threshold of a new Enlightenment. […] to meet the needs of a new global society […] we need to make the leap to a new <i>level</i> of knowledge and <i>understanding</i> of knowledge (2008: 13, author’s emphasis).</p>
<p class="noindent1">I will comment further on the positioning of the humanities in his transdisciplinary theory of knowledge; but first I will consider his account of knowledge as a human achievement within (and for) our universe. Rather than attempt a summary, I will locate his approach through several substantial quotations which expand the implications of his starting point, which is not with the most advanced or specialised forms of knowledge, but with a universal human capability: “It is the human perceptive and cognitive ability to gain knowledge and communicate this in dialogue with others in a common language that is the foundations of science. An awareness of this will lead one to start in the middle instead of at extremes, to start not with either subject or object, but rather with the process of knowing in living systems” (2008: 83-84). Besides the fact that “the middle” could be exemplified by documentary or fictional narrative, the very carefully formulated first sentence binds together as mutually constitutive knowledge, language and the human as a specific form of life. Instead of foregrounding rationality and objectivity as the criteria for thinking about knowledge, Brier affirms “the non-reductionist view that knowledge always originates from feeling – that is, from a volitional signifying living system with an inner experiential world and with, as well, a body relating to and distinguishing itself from both a natural world and a cultural environment by means of social communication” (2008: 147). What it has been usual to keep apart, Brier puts together without qualification, so that many of the characteristics of human knowing important to humanities thought – will, emotion, memory, individual experience as intrinsically embodied, identity, intersubjectivity, moral concepts and ethical practice, aesthetics, languages and cultures, time and place – are placed at the foundations of the human project of acquiring knowledge, not as sources of distraction or confusion. He writes that</p>
<p class="quote">It is important to acknowledge our existing ignorance regarding what it is to know and how knowledge comes about. We must also acknowledge that we are observers coexisting in language with other humans in culture and society. Our living in nature and in the social world is based on our biological existence as embodied beings with inner conscious worlds – that is, our psyches, in which volition, emotions, and (pre-linguistic) thought are born. […] All kinds of knowledge, such as scientific, phenomenological, and practical knowledge, are specializations of human knowledge and are based on the ability to make distinctions (and interpret them as meaningful signs) and to communicate them through everyday language. […] We awaken to a world situated in language with other humans, to a world or our own feelings and tendencies (will, affections, and drives) and to some non-human surroundings: the environment or nature […] The systematic expansion of knowledge generates three major and qualitatively different knowledge approaches: the sciences, the arts and humanities, and the social sciences. In most cultures each of these subdivisions entails an authorized system of knowledge. (119-120)</p>
<p class="noindent1">The final phrase completes the steps from the moment when we each “awaken to a world” through pre-linguistic thought, to learning our culture’s knowledge in its diverse kinds and to working with formal and objectified knowledge<sup><a id="note34" href="#note_34">34</a></sup> which has been determined according to socially agreed methods, principles, and forms of record. At the opposite extreme there is the reality which this objectified knowledge is a society’s “knowledge of” and which is only very partly comprehended by it, which Brier describes as “randomness or chaos […] a hypercomplexity of potential structures and potential information in an infinite, living dynamic” (2008: 201). Hypercomplexity is a characteristic of reality perceived to be positive in its implications, and it is not only experienced as external to consciousness. Brier expresses this in a way which brings some of the most fundamental aspects of inquiry in the humanities into the foreground when he writes that</p>
<p class="quote">It is not only the ‘outside’ world that persistently surprises us with its complexity and spontaneity, but also our ‘inner’ world, the ‘subconscious’ complexity and spontaneity behind our behaviour, including communication. […] This basic incompleteness of our knowledge of ourselves, the unknown reasons for our behaviour, and our lack of absolute conscious control over speech, are at the same time prerequisites for our ability to say and cognize something new (2008: 118).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Amongst all that Brier draws out from the work of Charles Sanders Pierce, there is one term which extends this notion of incompleteness in a way which is constructive for thinking about the forms of interpretation and argument by which humanities knowledge is created. He offers two explanations of Pierce’s term abduction, which adds a third term to the traditional logical pair of induction and deduction: firstly, abduction is “the ability to produce meaningful interpretations from a variety of experiences based on a mixture of perceptions and memories” (2008: 114); and, secondly, “Abduction is crucial to signification. It is the capacity to see something as a sign for something else, which is the deep wonder of consciousness and human intentionality and linguistic interpretation and understanding” (2008: 439). The interpretive and sense-making process<sup><a id="note35" href="#note_35">35</a></sup> which abduction identifies is common in ordinary reflection on experience and the double process of finding and making meaning, just as narrative is a “fundamental part of the communicative competence of modern man, <i>homo sapiens sapiens”</i> (2013: 231). Abduction offers a much better way of accounting for the lack of finality in humanities knowledge than the appeal to the individuality of the interpreter alone, because it integrates an openness to the multiple possibilities for knowledge in or among situations or texts with a will to find patterns and relationships linking what is otherwise disparate in knowledge and experience. It also gives a positive value, rather than regarding it as a distraction or source of error, to the grounding in time, place, inheritance and experience of each interpreter. Rather than produce exact knowledge (although some knowledge in the humanities is exact, for example, in bibliography), the work of the academic humanities is, through theory development and reflexive critique, to make expert an inherently human practice, that is, to “reduce complexity through meaning” (2008: 50). Knowledge work in the humanities reaches out towards universals, but these are always formulated as principles and values, meanings and interpretations. The individual mind persists as a critical variable in this work. Thinking and writing in the humanities is always conducted by a person or persons, positioned in culture, language, geography and history, drawing on a corpus of texts selected from the totality of texts, and directed to an audience, with the aim of affecting that audience’s thinking about what it means to be human – whether the audience is small or large, specialist or general, local or international.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Brier’s theory of knowledge, and the cluster of terms – emergence, complexity, autopoiesis, semiosis – which inform it opens thought on to a way of conceiving of creativity and innovation which challenges the present policy model and which I will take up below. But it also opens more generally on to the space of the new humanities because thought in that space is engaged with reality conceived in these terms, (see for example the work of N. Katherine Hayles, Alan Liu and Jerome McGann), because Brier grounds his theory of knowledge in the human individual embedded in language, society, culture and nature, and because the artifacts, practices, conventions, and technologies of communication are integral to the existence of the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">However, there is a significant hesitation in Brier’s placing of the humanities in his overall conception of knowledge. While he identifies the humanities as the name for the modern Western knowledge culture which is the other to the sciences, and presents them as having a common project, “to produce as much consistency and coherence in our thinking about ourselves and the world as possible” (2008: 13), his overall conception of the parts of knowledge, as signified in the evolving diagrammatic representations in <i>Cybersemiotics,</i> (figs 2.5-2.15) which culminate in the Cybersemiotic Star (2013: 224), seem to require only the sciences, the social sciences and philosophy. The issue is, I think, similar to that arising from Badiou’s conception of the parts of knowledge perceived as a totality from within philosophy (discussed below in <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a>) but without adducing a term for the whole including philosophy. Brier (like Badiou) is oriented towards the sciences, and it is not his task to propose what might be the implications for the modern humanities of his thinking and the disciplinary fields on which he draws. But this absence from another perspective points to the failure of the modern humanities to articulate a strong conception of what is distinctive in their work of knowledge creation; to do that now requires, as Derrida affirmed, the reconstruction of the space of the humanities from within.<sup><a id="note36" href="#note_36">36</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s2.10"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-10"><i>3.3.2 The Semiosphere</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">Brier’s critique of information science brings him close to the foundations of the academic humanities, through his discussion of the problems encountered in the development of information retrieval systems in Library and Information Science. I intend to consider the role of the library together with other cultural memory institutions in <a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter Four</a>; but the problem which concerns him, the adequate description of objects recording knowledge so that they are accessible to any user, points directly not only to the work of archivists and librarians, but also to humanities researchers. He observes that the materials librarians and archivists work with “can include recorded measurements and observations, theoretical knowledge, and meanings and visions or experiences, through media such as documents, books, records, tapes, programs, floppy disks, hypertext, compact discs, pictures, films, and videograms. These mediating forms (and future ones) can be summarized under the general LIS concept of a ‘document’ […] I will define a document as a human work with communicative intent directed towards other human beings and that is recorded in a material way” (2008: 45). The wider context, in which traditionally humanists, librarians and archivists were co-dependent, even if the humanist assumed that the librarian was only a service worker, is the literate learning required for the conservation, management and on-going interpretation of a society’s documentary inheritance.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The shift from oral to written memory created a new class of material objects, texts or semiotic objects, the recorded expressions of human thought. They are distinctively human additions to the objects of the given world, individually and collectively authored, conserved by law and convention as the collective memory <sup><a id="note37" href="#note_37">37</a></sup> of humanity, testimony to the potentials and limitations of human knowledge (moral, religious, legal, political, scientific, technological and artistic), and the fundamental resource for social, economic and cultural (re)invention. It is this class of objects which constitutes the distinctive field of inquiry of the humanities and, as Brier has argued for the mind and its products, they are in reality and participate in its ongoing formation. Hence, like physical objects in the space and time of the given world, semiotic objects also occupy space and time, but in a distinctive manner; they combine in themselves the cultural, the virtual and the actual.<sup><a id="note38" href="#note_38">38</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">One helpful term for that dimension of space, which immediately also applies to the space occupied by the university, is Lotman’s term “semiosphere”. He defines ‘”the intellectual world in which humanity and human society are enfolded and which is in constant interaction with the individual intellectual world of human beings” as “the semiosphere, that synchronic semiotic space which fills the borders of culture.” He writes that “The semiosphere, the space of culture, is not something that acts according to mapped out and pre-calculated plans. It seethes like the sun, centres of activity boil up in different places, in the depths and on the surface, irradiating relatively peaceful areas with its immense energy. But unlike that of the sun, the energy of the semiosphere is the energy of information, the energy of Thought” (1990: 3, 150).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Among the many important implications of this view is that it, like Brier’s, locates the order of information in culture at large rather than in the more restricted domains of research, new information and communications technologies, and the economy, with the consequence that these domains can be understood as special cases within a particular cultural formation. Lotman does not need the terms creativity or innovation to identify a specific but not necessarily constant feature of “the space of culture”, the formation of the new in whatever form, because he attributes an inherently dynamic character to the engagement of minds with information, the latter “enfolding” but not the possession of individuals, groups or institutions. The semiosphere as a concept accounts for how attempts to discipline information and knowledge must always fail, however powerful they may be for periods of time, as cultural agents explore the potentials of accumulated human knowledge, in Derrida’s phrase, “without condition”. Another important implication is that the contents of the semiosphere are in principle totally inclusive; nothing once thought (and transmitted to another) may be finally lost, everything that has been thought (and recorded) may be thought again in the new context of another human mind active in another specific time and place. Crucially, of course, if societies do not conserve the knowledge they create, or make it publicly accessible, it is lost to the collective memory. In short form, the semiosphere is a name for the real world of the materials used in the knowledge work of the humanities. It has no inherent order but is heterogeneous in its accumulated and contested presentations of humanity’s knowledge and of what it means to be human, that is, while each text is culturally, temporally and spatially conditioned, the totality of texts is “without condition”. It also identifies, in the attribution of energy to information, how differently the work of the university can be conceived if it is understood to derive its character and function from the inclusiveness of the semiosphere while, within the general human activity of “Thought”, having responsibility for the highest levels of abstraction and formalisation of knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To accept that “the semiosphere” gives a name to that “world” in relation to which the humanities came into existence, its work and purpose shaped by the nature of the semiotic objects which constitute it, is to accept that a much wider conception of the humanities than that formed in relation to manuscript and print culture is needed. Brier’s conception of the document includes all present and future media technologies, just as a new humanities must. But at present the semiosphere is divided in one way by the territorial boundaries set in place by the disciplinary organisation of the modern university, in which the humanities are supposed to occupy a small and contracting corner, and the historical evolution of information and communication or media technologies is crystallised into separate disciplines, typically in the social sciences. As the new field of digital humanities demonstrates, this process of specialisation based on the continuing invention of media technologies continues to fracture the humanities as a coherent project of knowledge formation.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s2.11"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-11"><i>3.3.3 The I-space, or Mapping the Semiosphere</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">The other term I wish to insert into this discussion is a conceptualisation of information developed from the analysis of the role of information in business organisations. Boisot has developed a concept, the I[nformation]-space, which, while applied specifically to understanding the evolution of the firm, extends in its most general form to a conceptualisation of the dynamic social space of cultural knowledge and cultural production and reproduction.<sup><a id="note39" href="#note_39">39</a></sup> If Lotman’s semiosphere is a universe studded with galaxies and constellations<sup><a id="note40" href="#note_40">40</a></sup> of texts, Boisot’s I-space represents the manifold organisational forms and contexts in which knowledge is created, controlled and put to work. As Boisot (1998: 55) defines it, the I-space is “a conceptual framework within which the behaviour of information flows can be explored and, through these, the creation and diffusion of knowledge within selected populations can be understood.” It is a dynamic space constituted by three dimensions represented as a cube: concrete-abstract; undiffused-diffused; uncodified-codified.<sup><a id="note41" href="#note_41">41</a></sup></p>
<div class="image" id="fig2.2">
<p class="fig"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/ill2.2.jpg" /></p>
<p class="imagecaption">Illustration 2: Boisot, 1998: 59.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Boisot understands knowledge creation as a human activity shaping and shaped by individual, institutional, social, cultural and ideological factors operating in dynamic relations with one another and exemplifying Lotman’s conception of “the energy of Thought”. The I-Space is, therefore, an inherently political domain, but it has no single reference point (unlike, for example, the world of the <i>Leviathan</i> title page<sup><a id="note42" href="#note_42">42</a></sup> ); the contents of the semiosphere can be classified and assembled (and declassified and re-assembled) by human action over time into textual communities, textual institutions, textual nation states, textual public spheres, but they always exceed any classification.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Two visualisations of moments in the formulation and diffusion of knowledge are also highly relevant to a broad conception of the multiple social functions of education as a knowledge institution. <a href="#fig2.2">Figure 3.2</a> above focuses on stages in the formulation of knowledge and its diffusion through a population: new knowledge begins as “highly idiosyncratic knowledge of particular events”; as knowledge becomes increasingly abstracted from specific situations, it becomes more widely sharable and applicable; as a result of its increasingly wide diffusion through society, using all the means of socially available communication, it can over time become generally taken for granted. <a href="#fig2.3">Figure 3.3</a> (below) identifies phases in the processing of information, which Boisot calls the Social Learning Cycle (SLC). It is important to emphasise Boisot’s double conception, that new knowledge can surface anywhere and its acquisition by a society’s members is a learning process requiring means for the new to become widely disseminated and habitual while new knowledge is continually being generated. In respect of the directional arrows in <a href="#fig2.2">Fig 3.2</a> and numbered phases in <a href="#fig2.3">Fig. 3.3</a>, Boisot affirms that they schematically represent a tendency in the creation and diffusion of new knowledge; data is “constantly on the move” and individuals and organisations interact with it in highly contextual ways (58-61).<sup><a id="note43" href="#note_43">43</a></sup></p>
<div class="image" id="fig2.3">
<p class="fig"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/ill2.3.jpg" /></p>
<p class="imagecaption">Illustration 3: Boisot, 1998: 60</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Three critical and related parameters in Boisot’s overall analysis are: the conception of knowledge substrates in which knowledge assets are embedded, categorised as heads, documents, and objects (1998: 154-157); the conception of three distinct kinds of information environment or regime - ordered, complex and chaotic - in which relationships are more or less structured in the I-space (67-69, 202-205); and the categorisation of social processes in the I-space as team, networking, organisational, and community (1998: 226-228). It can be readily imagined how knowledge creation in the university as it is now and as it could be in the future can be analysed through this set of parameters, although this is not Boisot’s aim. He does, however, in a chapter entitled “Culture as a Knowledge Asset”, open up a field of enquiry which is suggestive for a conception of knowledge work broader than that defined by economic considerations. His purpose in this chapter is to demonstrate that “it does not make much sense to talk of knowledge assets independently of the cultures in which they are embedded”. He observes that “Only a small part of what we call cultural knowledge gets itself embedded in technologies and artefacts. A large part is embodied in social processes, institutional practices, and traditions, many of which are carried around in people’s heads. For this reason cultural knowledge has been taken for granted […] At best, it is perceived to be behaviourally useful knowledge” (Boisot, 1998: 119, 117). Boisot builds on these points with a definition of cultural knowledge which provides a strong, fundamental basis on which to reposition knowledge creation as grounded in and driven by cultural rather than economic imperatives. He writes that</p>
<p class="quote">Culture operates at many levels of aggregation. We can talk of the culture of a group, of a firm, of an industry or a profession, of a region, of a country, or even of a group of countries. Yet at whatever level we choose to define it - national, regional, industrial, or corporate - culture remains the means by which non-genetic information is transmitted either within a given generation or from one generation to the next. Technological practice forms an integral part of such cultural transmission. But technological practice usually combines theoretical knowledge that may itself be pretty well universal in scope with more practical knowledge that is much more local and culture-specific in its application (Boisot, 1998: 118).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Although cultural knowledge is typically associated with the local, the particularistic and the contextual in Boisot’s account, it can manifest any combination of the dimensions which constitute the I-space. By describing it as “non-genetic”, he emphasises its non-natural origin and its humanly invented modes of representation and transmission, of which the Internet is the latest development. He notes that “An item of knowledge has to be internalised by contemporaries as well as by descendants before it can be properly considered cultural”; culture can be thought of as “a kind of collective memory whose spatio-temporal reach is determined by that of its biological and physical substrates” (120). Furthermore, “individual agents typically have multiple affiliations […] and are therefore subject to multiple cultural influences that interact and overlie each other. […] Thus, the cultural influences that bear down on a given data-processing agent - whether the agent be an individual human being, a small group, or a firm - are often superimposed on each other in overlapping layers” (136). For these reasons, in his account languages are one of a number of “discontinuities”, like laws and traditions, which nation-states can use to “foster a sense of cultural identity among their citizens” (123). As Kuokkanen demonstrates, they can also serve to maintain cultural differences against the impositions of dominant cultures.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This opening beyond the economic is characteristic of Boisot’s overall approach. One other set of connections which he draws (particularly significant for my later discussion of the gift and open access) is his distinction between contract and gift structures within the I-space (140-141). He shows that the culture of “more contract-oriented firms {…] confines them to the upper reaches of the I-space”, whereas a “different cultural logic” is at work in firms which can operate in the lower reaches of the I-space. This is the logic of the gift relationship, which is “far more open-ended and uncertain than the contract. […] It operates at a much lower level of codification and abstraction than contract-oriented exchange. Gift-based transactions not only require trust for their consummation, they create it as well.” He observes that national values and beliefs exercise considerable influence on forms of knowledge exchange and the demarcation of the boundaries of the firm, giving as an example the “strong preference for competitively determined contractual relations” characteristic of US culture. But in the case for a new humanities which I am developing, the most important level of social interaction and circulation of thought is the lower level, where metaphors like well-spring and seed-bed capture the generativity of thought in open exchange and shared learning.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Boisot does not apply his analysis to the university as, for example, a bureaucratic organisation or a firm, but it is clear that it is immediately possible to plot positions for various modalities of the university in the I-space. The critical value of his analysis is that it exposes the profound implications for the university of being an organisation the principal work of which is carried out in the space of information, and for the humanities of being a mode of knowledge in which the objects of its investigations are already present in the I-space. In particular, different modes of the humanities can be located at different points in the I-space, depending on whether their methods and theories emphasise order and continuity in knowledge and practice, or disruption and discontinuity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Furthermore, their materials can also find locations in this space, regardless of whether they are narratively or analytically structured. As with Lotman’s semiosphere, this conception does not invoke creativity as a necessary explanatory term for discovery and innovation in knowledge work, partly because it assumes a dynamic informational, institutional and cultural environment within which individual agents produce and circulate meaning and knowledge, rather than locating that dynamic only or primarily in the individual. The modern university reaches its bureaucratic limit in the on-going fracturing of traditional disciplines and the fuzziness of their administrative borders through alternative forms of relationship signified by terms like multidisciplinarity or interdisciplinarity. It can make more sense in respect of humanistic knowledge to think of groupings of kinds of non-genetic knowledge as evolving cultural fields, so making accessible the dynamic relations between different kinds of knowledge as these are shaped by local conditions, histories and inherited and new values. To locate the postmodern university conceived of as Derrida’s “university without condition” in the I-space requires imagining a border state in which abstract and highly codified knowledge in the humanities is formed from chaotic<sup><a id="note44" href="#note_44">44</a></sup> semiotic materials encountered and interactive in cultural fields. The proper effect of such a process is that the humanities themselves become chaotic in relation to existing institutions and disciplines. This is the condition of the humanities in their encounter with poetry, to be discussed in <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a>.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s2.12"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-12"><i>3.3.4 Creativity and innovation</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">The dynamic terms used of the information order by Lotman and Boisot, energy and flow, are also conventional attributes of creativity, as is Derrida’s term “without condition”, since the association between creativity as the name for a human disposition and capability and the work of bringing the new, the possible, the potential into existence is strong. But the term’s relation to the work of the modern university is ambiguous, especially when it has been historically attributed to kinds of object and modes of work which are informational and aesthetic in origin, and for which the term fiction marks a decisive attribute. Furthermore, since mental work in itself does not necessarily produce the new, but much is directed towards preserving or extending the already known, what characteristics of the terms creativity and innovation need to be identified when the full range of the real objects filling the semiosphere or the I-space is considered, rather than only the set of objects constituting technoscientific knowledge? And what characteristics of the objects comprising the semiosphere are of decisive important in determining how creativity and innovation can occur in the knowledge work of a new humanities, and therefore contribute to bringing into existence a new conception of the university?</p>
<p class="noindent1">At the heart of my approach to these questions from a perspective in the humanities is Brier’s inclusive conception of “our ability to say and cognize something new” (2008: 118). A study of innovation conducted through the disciplines of psychology and anthropology in the 1950s is refreshing because of its differently organised frame of enquiry, in which neither government nor the corporation is of particular significance. In his study <i>Innovation. The basis of cultural change</i>, H. G. Barnett is interested in a general theory of innovation, and he grounds it in a set of basic concepts of particular relevance to my interests.</p>
<p class="noindent1">His initial point is two-fold, and is resonant with Brier’s conception of the origin of meaning and knowledge. As the title of the book makes clear, it is cultural change which Barnett takes to be the proper or full context for understanding innovation; in this context, “Everyone is an innovator, whether popular definitions allow him that recognition or not (1953: 9).” From a university or governmental perspective, adopting such a basis for trying to establish an innovation policy or direct academic development could seem hopelessly inclusive and incapable of providing the categories needed for defining strategies and priorities (a “chaotic” conception, in other words). However, by locating the discussion in a proposition that, in effect, claims that the ability to innovate is a human characteristic, and is not restricted to a specific domain of knowledge, a kind of institution, or a market, Barnett provides an opening for the view that a knowledge policy and a new humanities must be grounded in a democratic conception of creativity and innovation. This argument has been fully extended into the early twenty-first century by Hartley (2012: 47), who describes conceiving of creativity as a “population-wide attribute [which] requires social networks, and its ‘product’ is the growth of knowledge,” as a “radically democratic move.”<sup><a id="note45" href="#note_45">45</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Barnett defines an innovation as “any thought, behaviour or thing that is new because it is qualitatively different from existing forms. […] ‘Innovation’ is therefore a comprehensive term covering all kinds of mental constructs, whether they can be given sensible representation or not” (1953: 7). He notes that, “Because man-made objects have an extramental existence, it is deceptively easy to formulate a theory of innovation which will purport to describe their conception. It is much easier to explain them as things than as ideas” (3). This special case in his general theory is in effect the exemplary case on which much current innovation strategy is built. By contrast, he affirms that “Every innovation is a combination of ideas. The only bonds between its parts in a cultural setting are mental connections” (16). Furthermore, “the size and complexity of the cultural inventory that is available to an innovator establishes limits within which he must function. […] A sizable inventory allows for more new combinations and permits more differences of approach in problem solution than does a small one. […] facility and extent of communication influences the communication of ideas” (40). The domain of innovation is thus the domain identified by Lotman’s semiosphere and Boisot’s I-space, as indicated by Barnett’s focus on “mental constructs”, the “cultural setting” and the “cultural inventory”, and the intersections between this collective inheritance and the mental work of individuals as these are particularly facilitated (or obstructed) by the available communications and institutional infrastructure.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The implications of emphasising creativity and innovation as fundamentally cultural processes involving individuals’ mental work are extended by an essay considering a performance of Shakespeare’s <i>Othello</i>, in which the ability of a theatrical event to reframe human experience for its audience and so release the new in the experience of the audience is considered. Hastrup introduces another key term into the consideration of creativity when she argues that “Creative agency in my view is a capacity to bring the as yet unknown to effect by way of imaginative power” and through offering access to “the potentiality of the moment” (2011: 40, 43). Imagination is critical because “Understanding is an <i>event</i>. We ‘intimate’ unprecedented incidents or other worlds by means of imaginative projections from previous experience. […] The logic of imaginative creativity is not distinct from the logic of reasoning; they are aspects of the same capacity for intimation, which is part of our being ‘cultural’” (40-41). Hastrup’s argument is based on a distinction between discovery and invention, in which discovery is the outcome of a prior conceptualisation, whereas invention produces the ontologically new. Creativity is, as a mode of invention, “not only to discover or innovate […] It is to reach a new potentiality by finding the ontologically new” (31-32). The play is a fictional vehicle engaging its audience in the kinds of mental work which can open out on to the state of being “without condition”, engaging with the “what if?” in an environment which can displace the familiar and conventional with mental events making what is potential in knowledge and experience accessible to thought. The play, in this way, facilitates what Derrida describes as “an experience [which] is a traversal, something that <i>traverses</i> and travels toward a destination for which it finds the appropriate passage” (1992: 16; author’s emphasis) – a mental event which can accomplish a qualitative transformation in collective knowledge. The play externalises and makes what is normal in human mental activity, that is, the private projection of ideas, scenarios, narratives on the screen of the mind, the means of a collective experience.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In Barnett’s and Hastrup’s accounts, creativity and innovation refer to a mode of mental work which produces something others will perceive as new. That the outcome could be a commercial product is only a special instance of a general process, not the end-point; the context of evaluation is cultural, not scientific or commercial, and no particular kind of knowledge is privileged as a source of the new. It is particularly important to underline what is at stake in Hastrup’s argument: a old fictional text generates a new event by combining with cultural elements contemporary with the modern performance and not available to Shakespeare in the same way that human memory combines knowledge and experience from different times and places, personal and social, in the on-going process of sense-making, a process which is anchored in subjectivity and to inherited knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is, however, worth being reminded at this point that the shift towards a technoscientific conception of innovation was observed by William Kingston in the 1970s. In his study of innovation, <i>Innovation: The Creative Impulse in Human Progress: Industry, Art, Science</i>, he wrote that “innovation is simply one way in which human creative energy is expressed, but it has been characteristic of recent stages in the culture of the West that this particular type of energy has tended to run into technological and technical innovation, rather than into survival or liturgy or art or literature” (1975: 7). He marked a critical factor in this social evolution, which is acknowledged by Boisot’s later focussing of his analysis on the firm, in proposing that business culture should be added to the two cultures of art and science discussed by C. P. Snow (he noted that a fourth, government, should be added as well). It is also the case, of course, that the texts of science, policy, technology and commerce constitute increasingly substantial sectors in the semiosphere.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Two extensions of Brier’s and Barnett’s emphasis upon a democratic conception of creativity and innovation and the multiple worlds of knowledge-making are important at this point, because they take us further into the implications of making the semiosphere and the scope of the humanities in the university co-extensive, in respect of what humanity knows (as distinct from what humanity may come to know). One is the standing in the university and elsewhere of indigenous or traditional knowledge; the other is open access to knowledge and information.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s2.13"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-13"><i>3.3.5 Indigenous knowledge</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">At least in nation states like New Zealand which were formed as European imperial colonies, postmodernity has come to include the need to reset the common colonial history of cultural, linguistic and economic oppression of indigenous peoples. At its core, this resetting requires the recognition that there is more than one kind of true knowledge, one version of human history, one conception of the economy, or one way of thinking about what it means to be human in the world in which humanity finds itself. It installs at the centre of discussions about knowledge, truth and innovation the multiplicity of knowledges, their origins, their terms of reference, and their methods of validation, and hence a politics of knowledges, because productive relations between them can only be negotiated, not authoritatively determined. In whatever domains of society these negotiations take place, from negotiations between individuals to groups and institutions and nations, the guarantor of them in a democratic society must be the law and Parliament. In New Zealand, the creation of the Waitangi Tribunal, to provide a formal means of hearing and resolving historical grievances and claims resulting from colonisation, has also served to foreground the relation between culture, land and knowledge. This relation has been powerfully elaborated in a report <i>Ko Aotearoa tēnei</i> (2011), which looks beyond the claims process to the form of future relations between different conceptions of knowledge in the postmodern world order.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As the role of the arts and humanities has diminished in modern Western universities, so has the fundamental role of traditional or inherited knowledge in the sustaining of societies and their citizens through time diminished in general understanding as well as in policy thinking. Science developed as a knowledge system through its challenge to inherited authoritative knowledge about the natural order and through a positive and progressive relation to the formation of new knowledge, encouraging as it did so a future-oriented culture (marked, for example, by the development in the late nineteenth century of science fiction as a new narrative genre) based in universally valid rather than locally specific knowledge. Technoscientific knowledge is now assumed to be the defining attribute of culture in a progressive society like New Zealand. However, as a result of the recovery of the Treaty of Waitangi and its reassertion as a foundational element of New Zealand’s unwritten constitution, another body of traditional knowledge has been reaffirmed – matauranga Māori. As indigenous knowledge, in the context of the partnership between Māori and Pakeha cultures affirmed through the Treaty, traditional knowledge persists in the negotiations of knowledge policy (Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, (2014: 23) “Vision matauranga”) like grit in the gears and draws attention to the politics embedded in the assumption that Western scientific knowledge is principally (if not exclusively) the knowledge of social and economic value.<sup><a id="note46" href="#note_46">46</a></sup> It is at the least a matter for ironical reflection that an endangered knowledge and the language in which it is properly known, that of the indigenous peoples of Aotearoa New Zealand, should be the means of keeping the importance of inherited knowledge and the institutions supporting its conservation, transmission and transformation in place in government policies, even if the traditional knowledge of European settlers is otherwise practically absent from the nation’s research and innovation policies. It is primarily through teaching and scholarship (inside and outside the university) that the meaning and value of this knowledge is reconsidered and re-evaluated for each new generation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Although there are governmental spaces for Pakeha traditional knowledge – heritage (artistic, historical, architectural and scenic) is probably the most inclusive concept, but New Zealanders’ participation in the major wars of the twentieth century provides currently the most culturally unifying theme – this knowledge is allocated in the current government’s priorities to national identity, not to economic transformation, a split characteristic of neoliberal social theory and the knowledge rankings which follow from it. In claiming a similarity between indigenous and settler knowledge traditions, I am nonetheless aware that such a claim is unlikely to be readily accepted. European culture in its imperial form, of which British settler culture is an instance, has typically asserted its superiority over indigenous cultures (including folk cultures in Europe) and has based that assertion on the combined outcomes of developments in the scientific, historical, aesthetic and moral dimensions of knowledge, collectively represented in the term civilisation and its technological enforcer. However, the drastic reduction in the later twentieth century of the grounds of this assertion to technoscientific knowledge, and the retreat of the academic version of inherited European knowledge out of policy discourse and into the universities, makes another view worth entertaining.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The terms of such view are insightfully argued by Kuokkanen ((2007); see also White and Grice (2008) and essays in Bakker et al (2006), Smith and Jesson (2005)) in her eloquent case for a new settlement in the relations between Western and indigenous knowledges as those relations are currently represented in modern universities (a case which extends to governments as well). At first glance, her arguments are unhelpful because they include a trenchant case against liberal humanism as “complicit in the processes of colonisation” (19). By so firmly locating the humanities together with the rest of the knowledges which constitute the modern university and have participated in the European imperial project, Kuokkanen makes from another perspective a judgment similar to that made by Gibbons’ et al in their succinct summation of the accommodation of the academic humanities to the scientific paradigm in the term scientification. In particular, her argument exposes the very difficult question whether there are knowledge universals deriving from enquiry into human cultures, as there are from scientific enquiry into nature. Her position, as that of postcolonial theory, is that cultural universals are a component in the claim to dominance of one group over another, a function of power relations, not of truth. She observes that the values of liberal humanism “ - equity, individualism, rationalism, progress and democracy – are inherently problematic in that they run squarely counter to key principles of indigenous philosophies and world-views” (19). The terms of her argument which point in a direction pertinent to my analysis of the situation of the humanities derive from the striking conjunction which is established by two ratios: as Western knowledge is to indigenous knowledge, so science is to the humanities. The way in which she positions her argument is of particular importance, because she rejects a “return to precolonial indigenous practices [or] formulating action plans grounded in cultural authenticity, nationalism, or separatism” (24) as the basis for her case for a new relationship, just as I reject the possibility of achieving recognition by government of the critical role of the humanities in the postmodern knowledge society through a reassertion of traditional humanities disciplines. Instead, she argues that “the academy must [reconsider] the epistemological and ontological assumptions, structures and prejudices on which it has been founded” (125), if indigenous epistemes are to participate equally in the work of the university through the “convergence of different epistemes” in a process of “conceptual transformation and ongoing epistemic engagement” (120). Engagement is premised on “the logic of the gift, which is characterized by commitment to and participation in reciprocal responsibilities. […] One is given a gift, which comes with a responsibility to recognize it – that is, not take it for granted – and to receive it according to certain responsibilities. When we understand the gift as an expression of responsibility towards the ‘other’, we foreground the law of hospitality” (127). Recognising the gift of indigenous knowledge requires recognising that “The world is not an abstraction or a location ‘out there’; it is the concrete environment in which we find ourselves in our everyday lives and in whose processes we participate […] concepts can be understood in multiple, significantly different ways, depending on the lens through which we interpret them and on how we relate ourselves to the world” (119-120). By adopting the concept of the gift as the anchoring principle of a theory of knowledge relations, Kuokkanen inverts the current dominant paradigm<sup><a id="note47" href="#note_47">47</a></sup> (which fully informs every aspect of current knowledge policy), which she describes as the “exchange paradigm, which is fuelled by self-interest, possessive individualism, and accumulation of profit (one form of which is cultural and intellectual capital). […] Today’s logic of exchange is affecting the entire culture of learning, education, and academic freedom by limiting the possibility of engaging in the pursuit of knowledge. […] we should call the academy what it is: a corporation inhabited by privatised academics who manufacture a commodity called knowledge” (89). By locating her analysis in a theory of social relations in which the logic of the gift is the fundamental premise, Kuokkanen establishes the basis for a theory of knowledge work in which human purposes, values and differences, not the universals of nature, are the most important defining characteristic, and for a theory of knowledge institutions which is grounded in discursive equality, not the hegemony of one part of knowledge over all its other parts. The current academy as Kuokkanen perceives it from a position both inside and outside the institution is unsparingly condemned: “Academic discourses and practices are exploitative, hegemonic, asymmetrical, and patriarchal. […] Before indigenous epistemes can ever be recognized as an invaluable gift to intellectual inquiry and knowledge production, there will have to be nothing less than an overhaul of the value system that underpins today’s academic structures and discourses” (88-89). The rigour of her critique is both necessary and invigorating because it seeks to restore to knowledge work the values which liberal humanism espouses but which she sees, from her position in indigenous knowledge, to be complicit with a “dominant neo-colonial and neoliberal paradigm” (88).</p>
<p class="noindent1">However complicated the evolution of the relationship between the humanities and indigenous knowledges, it is clear that the sciences’ break with traditional European knowledge was also a break with the humanities, and that in fundamental respects indigenous knowledge and the humanities are closely aligned. The ultimate source of the vitality of the humanities is local, from the deep well of human experience and embodied living in a specific place and time made conscious in thought and available to others through shared systems of representation. The most universal system is languages; the invention of writing brought about the invention of institutions for accumulating and storing objectified and depersonalised knowledge and disseminating it across time and space. Put another way, the embodied mind is a singular intersection of collective human knowledge, shaped by local social and personal memory, the grounding of identity in the local specifics of land(scape), built environment, familial relationships, life history, social and economic status, education, dominant institutions, ideologies, and modes of social and political governance. The invention of new knowledge is a collective, profoundly complex process in which no kind of knowledge, no social group, no intellectual system, should have any inherent priority.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s2.14"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-14"><i>3.3.6 The Commons of the Mind</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">Re-thinking the position of the humanities in the postmodern knowledge order requires a category/conception inclusive of all those objects (linguistic, mathematical, graphic, imagistic, musical, performative, architectural, technological) which are marked by signs and can communicate to (some) human interlocutors/interpreters. If the concepts of the semiosphere and I-space perform this inclusive function for thought, the most important division of semiotic space, its Mason and Dixon line, is now the division between private and public ownership of knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The social theory and value spectrum which derives from substituting the contemporary Western economy for a more complex account of human societies places science, industry, and business into the category of private ownership, and the arts, humanities and education into the category of public ownership. While there is a large grey area where this distribution is ambiguous, for example, scientific research as a public good, the art market, cultural creation defined as creative industries, private education, media systems as channels for public communication and education, the present default model in Western (shareholder) societies is private ownership. The gift relationship argued for by Kuokkanen proposes, like analyses of the knowledge society proceeding from civil society or public good perspectives, to advance a model of knowledge creation and dissemination which is grounded in a social theory more inclusive than neoliberalism because it focuses on collective social interests which may have economic implications or effects but where this is not their main purpose. For the purposes of this study, it is education (as a social institution, a learned profession, a public responsibility, a transmitter of civic values across generations, and an area of enquiry) and not the economy which is taken to be the primary location of the knowledge work accomplished by the arts and humanities. The extension of this work into the political and values domain of social action is accomplished, on the one hand, by the media, and on the other, by civil society organisations.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The promotion of the concept of the knowledge economy as the core of a new, post-industrial economy occurred in step with the rapid deployment of digital and networked information and communications technologies, in the last two decades of the twentieth century. This development was complemented by the transfer of the ownership of media and telecommunications systems from the public to the private sector. As many writers have recognised (but many politicians have not), making information the new material for economic production in a context of increasing private control over access to information may serve private interests but has profoundly negative implications for the wider public interest, especially in all those aspects of democratic social and institutional development which are not contained within the bounds of the market economy, but on which the market economy depends for its vitality.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Consistent with the position that the medium is an integral component of a text, not a neutral vehicle for its content, and participates in meaning-generation, the complex medium shift from print to digital information and communications technologies focused sharply many of the issues of concern to the humanities. As Lawrence Lessig (2001: 23) has noted, for example, the Internet is not just a technological product; it is an artefact informed by a design philosophy with the original aim of making possible “an innovation commons.” Lessig’s alarm at the erosion of open access to information on the Internet led him and others to an important invention, Creative Commons, an alternative to copyright which recognises and seeks to oppose a predominant political and institutional tendency towards the control of information (86), which is especially evident in the evolution and management of new information and communications technologies.<sup><a id="note48" href="#note_48">48</a></sup> Against this tendency he affirmed the principle of open access, based on a conception of creativity and innovation which reflects the historical role of information in social development as a cultural resource: “in the digital world, all the stuff protected by copyright law is in one sense the same: It all depends fundamentally upon a rich and diverse public domain. Free content, in other words, is crucial to building and supporting new content” (50).</p>
<p class="noindent1">While this principle is gaining significant support among academics, researchers and research funders, research publications based on open access principles have been established<sup><a id="note49" href="#note_49">49</a></sup>, and procedures for open access to government information have been instituted<sup><a id="note50" href="#note_50">50</a></sup>, its implications for universities as publicly funded knowledge creators, and the modes of publication and distribution of their work, have yet to be fully addressed. Notably, the marginalizing of the humanities (because of their dependence on public research funding, and their exclusion from the science-technology-business nexus) is itself direct evidence of the recent shift in government policy both to limited economic conceptions of what constitutes knowledge of value and to the downgrading of the public domain in relation to the private sector. The traditional concern of the humanities with education for democratic citizenship, conservation and analysis of the contents of humanity’s collective memory, and interpretation of aesthetic texts, are all functions of a mode of knowing which focuses on a society’s self-understanding and the complex, public and open conversation by which this understanding is revised and elaborated.<sup><a id="note51" href="#note_51">51</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">An early and very important instance of this challenge was the National Scholarly Communications Forum, a project led by the Australian Academy of the Humanities in collaboration with the National Library of Australia and Australian research libraries and involving all four Learned Academies, academics, publishers, and specialists in copyright and in digital technologies. Its first Roundtable was held in 1994, and it has continued to the present.<sup><a id="note52" href="#note_52">52</a></sup> It exemplified Kranich’s view that the “collaboration of institutions like libraries and universities remain[s] so vital to protecting, promoting, sustaining, and preserving newly emergent knowledge commons” (2007: 95) by providing a site where key institutions in the nation’s knowledge system could challenge the business model of information as a profitable resource. A key text was John Houghton’s “The Economics of Scholarly Communication”<sup><a id="note53" href="#note_53">53</a></sup>, which provided a powerful demonstration of the new imperialism of global media corporations and their appropriation of national and publicly funded knowledge assets through the acquisition of academic journal titles (Kranich, 2007: 88). It also illustrated the ease with which universities could become co-opted to serve these interests through the academic promotion system.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The term scholarly communication has become a key term in the development of knowledge commons concepts and practices in part because universities remain in a state of conflicted goals and purposes. On the one hand, they are still primarily publicly funded knowledge creating and transmitting institutions; on the other, they are under enormous pressure to conform to political and corporate conceptions of the economic value of (specific kinds of) knowledge. The communicational circuits within which new academic knowledge is formulated and exchanged, the forces which shape and prioritise them and the conflicting forms of valuation of knowledge work, reveal a great deal about the ways in which the meaning and purpose of research as the generation of new knowledge in all domains is being directed by private interests through public policies. But the same is true, of course, of the communicational circuits through which public knowledge of all kinds is disseminated. At its most general, the myriad conversations between members of a society, on which the very possibility of any society depends, and the openness of which is fundamental to the maintenance of a democratic society, have also become captured by the technological systems which facilitate their global circulation. Social media is now only the most obvious example of this capture for corporate purposes; the surveillance state is another. While each new information and communications technology (ICT) providing a distance communication capability and therefore creating a record of the communication has generated new forms of surveillance and censorship in states troubled by the potential for innovation offered by communications technologies and free thought, digital networked technologies have made possible by democratic as well as authoritarian states the previously unimaginable global screening of human communication. Here, one might say, is the evil twin of the (digital) humanities; (machinic) analysis and interpretation of human communication and thought is conducted with the end of political and social control rather than the expansion of our knowledge and understanding of who and why we are as a species in this world.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The view in HUMANZ that the humanities function primarily as public good knowledge was a strong motive for taking the opportunity to lead the development of the Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) licences. CCANZ has since become a focal point for creative work, notably in music and digital arts, the development of educational materials by teachers, access to cultural collections, and access to academic research through universities’ digital repositories. But a critical, cultural question which this development raised was, Could these licences be applied to indigenous cultural and intellectual property? The then Ministry of Economic Development had published a report in 2007 aimed at providing advice to Māori about intellectual property law, but the writers also acknowledged the “inability of conventional IP rights systems to provide adequate protection for traditional knowledge, or to limit the use of traditional knowledge to the appropriate holders of that knowledge only” (2). Reports written by Terri Janke in Australia offered a very thorough investigation of the issues.<sup><a id="note54" href="#note_54">54</a></sup> Just as the writing of the CCANZ licences had required confronting the embeddedness of the CC International licences in the culture and language of American law, so the core conceptions in New Zealand as in American IP law of originality and the individual property owner imposed a fundamental barrier to any simple adaptation of the CCANZ licences.<sup><a id="note55" href="#note_55">55</a></sup> The fact that collective ownership of knowledge makes it very difficult to distinguish between cultural heritage and intellectual property points back to the inadequacy of Western conceptions<sup><a id="note56" href="#note_56">56</a></sup>, especially when the issue of public ownership and the role of heritage institutions (to be discussed in <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a>) is considered. A full survey and consideration of the issues in an Aotearoa New Zealand context has been recently published as <a href="09_ST_CHR1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1</a> of the report, <i>Ko Aotearoa Tenēi</i> by the Waitangi Tribunal<sup><a id="note57" href="#note_57">57</a></sup>, a report the significance of which for the future evolution of culture, research and knowledge creation in this country cannot be underestimated. An important framing of the discussion at this time in relation to creative arts was given by a Māori filmmaker, Barry Barclay, in his book on the concept of mana tuturu: “I felt it was important to have a Māori marker stone established in the English-language landscape, something which spoke up for another world. […] The mana tuturu principle will mean ‘Māori spiritual guardianship’” (2005: 113-114). His emphasis on the gift relationship effected by a cultural object invokes the principles also advanced by Kuokkainen, acknowledging that the dominant culture’s legal system and conceptions of ownership are not those of the indigenous culture occupying the same land: “We necessarily talk of rights, but the spirit of the mana tuturu agreement has much to do with generosity, with dignity for all parties, with sharing, and, yes, if you like, with exuberance and confidence” (135). Barclay contrasts this conception of an on-going connection between cultural works and persons who care for and about them, which sustains the gift relationship, with the situation of such works when the copyright term has expired; he thinks of “film images of individuals and their families” as then entering “that bleak hinterland called public domain” (116). By insisting that the vitality and value of a culture’s knowledge is a function of its intimate and continuing connection with those who were its source, Barclay demonstrates how reductive it is to conceive of the work of knowledge creation as commodity production. He connects instead with a humanistic conception of the dependence of a culture’s knowledge inheritance on the will and ability of its people to maintain its vitality by respectfully conserving, curating, re-experiencing and re-interpreting its texts.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The implicit value opposition in copyright is between new and old knowledge, respectively commercially valuable and commercially worthless, which can be made to, but does not properly, apply either in the humanities or in indigenous cultures. A different conception of the public domain to Barclay’s has been advanced by Christopher Moore, but by way of declining this way of valuing out-of-copyright texts:</p>
<p class="quote">The public domain is at its greatest potential when considered, not as the retirement home or dumping ground for old material, but as the raw resource for future productions. […] As the ability to access the public domain is removed by longer copyright duration, people lose access to their cultural heritage, both to works from the past and to those works to come in the future. […] A growing public domain not only increases the amount of uncontrolled and unregulated information that educators, scientists, creative artists and policy-makers can draw from and innovate on, it also reduces development costs and increases productivity. The strengths of the public domain are exponentially increased by digital and communications technologies, yet diminished by the extension of copyright. Without fixed and stable limits on copyright, costs to use copyrighted material will preclude the majority of innovative activity, and people are thus denied unrestricted access to the materials formed as part of their common culture (2005: 75).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The usual binary pair of time-delimited intellectual property and its ultimate residence in the public domain as either a wasteland or the repository of cultural heritage, the “negative of the private domain”, (Dusollier, 2009: 7) is less helpful than it might seem, as Dusollier argues in a critique of the metaphor of the public domain by demonstrating that the boundaries between the realm of intellectual property and copyright, and the public domain, are not sharply demarcated; resources in the public domain can easily become intellectual property, and resources covered by an intellectual property right may also be freely usable in specific circumstances. Her concern, like Moore’s, is the need “to counteract the pervasive diminution of the publicly available intellectual commons” (7), but to do this by understanding that “The evolution of the intellectual property regime shows that the public domain is not as much as [sic] an open territory from which some limited lands are grabbed to form islands of exclusivity than a way to allocate rights of access to intellectual resources, whether in the form of exclusive property or in the form of non-exclusive liberties” (14)<sup><a id="note58" href="#note_58">58</a></sup>. This line of thought opens out on to an issue of considerable significance for much of my case for the humanities as knowledge perceived to lack economic value in current government policies. To turn this apparent negative to a positive by arguing that humanistic knowledge properly belongs to the public domain and is a public good does not alter the balance of power because, as Dusollier argues, in this Western and not indigenous structure of relations, “nature, or the public domain, [is] private property to be” (11). Furthermore, traditional knowledge, the whole matter of <i>Ko Aotearoa Tēnei</i>, is particularly vulnerable to use (and abuse) because it falls outside the legal conventions governing intellectual property regimes. Dusollier concludes that “the (now global) regime of intellectual property denies the exclusivity to other forms of intellectual production, knowledge or cultural expression, not to promote a vibrant cultural, scientific and knowledge public domain, but to empower Western entrepreneurs to benefit from monopolies based on such primary materials, which they do not own originally” (14-15).<sup><a id="note59" href="#note_59">59</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Seen from the perspective of collective ownership and the conception of knowledge as heritage, the inadequacy of Western conceptions of intellectual property for understanding the work of knowledge in culture and the humanities as it is grounded in access to the past (which begins a nanosecond ago) is underlined, and the link with conceptions of indigenous knowledge is made more firmly. From the perspective of culture, the fundamental role of creativity and innovation is to bring the future into consciousness, which means placing a human direction on the course of time and human evolution, that is, continually creating history and society and, in the process, revealing more of humanity to-come. Because there are many knowledge cultures (not only in the form of academic discipline groupings within the expert system of the university but in communities based on shared knowledge in all reaches of society, local and global) a public policy for knowledge needs to provide an account of the diverse ways in which knowledge of all kinds is socially generative as it is diffused through a society by means of all the communication channels available to it.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s2.15"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-15">4. Semiotic Objects and the Space of the Humanities</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">How many-dimensioned is the space of the humanities? A succinct idea was given in 2013 with the publication of four studies of the humanities. Rens Bod’s <i>A New History of the Humanities. The Search for Principles and Patterns from Antiquity to the Present,</i> provides an anchor for the others which at the same time confirms their difference of orientation and permits a larger point to be made about the critical importance of locality in the creation of thought in the humanities. Bod claims that his study is the first general history of the humanities while observing that, unlike the sciences, “there is no central humanities discipline on which all the other disciplines can be modelled.” Furthermore, considering these disciplines across regions and in different periods (across cultures and languages, as well as times and places) leads to the recognition that “The contexts of these disciplines, as well as their concepts, can differ endlessly [but] there appear to be deep commonalities at the level of principles used and patterns found “ (4-5). For this reason, Bod’s history searches for these commonalities, also observing that actual interactions in humanistic thought between regions and periods are obscured both by confining analysis to the Western tradition, and the unavailability of many texts because they cannot be accessed or have not been translated. While he concludes that “The quest for principles and patterns in language, texts, music, art, and literature is of all times and places” (361), and that this should be the motive for a universal history, he also discovers that a pattern-rejecting tradition is ancient and widely distributed. This diversity, marked for example, by the “coexistence of mathematical modelling […] and subjective narration […] makes the humanities the most unlikely of all human doings” (362-363).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The framing perspective of Bod’s work is European<sup><a id="note60" href="#note_60">60</a></sup>. The other three studies which I will briefly notice confirm his core perception of the shaping importance of the different contexts (temporal, geopolitical, linguistic and cultural) in which academic work in the humanities is carried out. They are all written and published in Anglo-American jurisdictions (the United Kingdom – by a New Zealander, the United States of America, and Australia), and this fact of the authors’ locations and their multi-national experience makes a real difference to the concerns and outcomes of each study. They instance the diversity of thinking which is generated by trying to face the problem presented by the utter marginalising of humanistic knowledge in democratic societies; taken together they provide a helpful contextualisation for my argument in this book.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Helen Small, <i>The Value of the Humanities</i></p>
<p>The immediate context for this study is the requirement placed on the humanities by United Kingdom government policies and university administrations to justify their continued funding by demonstrating their public value. Her book tests and seeks to clarify the arguments which can be used in “situations in which it is, obviously, necessary to respond to demands from government, and from university administrators who have to answer to government, that those who study and teach the humanities should be able to articulate the public value of their work: giving reasons why their subject area matters comparatively with other subject areas, and why it matters in its own right” (2). To do this, Small isolates five claims which are adduced commonly to make the case for the humanities: their mode of knowledge work is distinctive; their value should not be measured by their utility; they contribute to happiness; they underpin democracy; and they have value for their own sake. Her approach is based on identifying “genealogies of argument” and engages the work of English writers principally from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries who have mounted defences of humane letters. While significant changes in context for this defence have occurred – a good example is her recovery of a defence based on the humanities’ contribution to happiness – there is also a strong sense of continuity which is manifested in both the book’s mode of literate conversation and a sense that the humanities disciplines are stable, any case for “the humanities” in general being academically evaluated from a disciplinary perspective. She notes that the “democracy” claim is currently prominent but needs to be carefully qualified; on the positive side, the humanities contribution derives from being centrally concerned with “the cultural practices of reflection, argument, criticism, and speculative testing of ideas” (7). She concludes that this distinctive kind of intellectual labour does have public value even if it is currently unacknowledged in “the public conversation about matters of common interest” (174) and the “government-imposed requirements that public money should promote ‘knowledge transfer’, ‘economic relevance’, and ‘impact’ or social benefit” (15). This distinctive character is qualified by discipline differences, on one the hand, and national differences, on the other. Because of the single honours system in English universities, the term humanities “remains more of an American than an English term” (14) and traditions of defence in the two university systems, embedded as they are in different systems of government and funding, and different histories, are significantly different in orientation and emphasis (17-18)<sup><a id="note61" href="#note_61">61</a></sup>. As well, “few of us working in humanities departments seem to identify closely with the term ‘humanist’” (24). Among all the issues Small considers, I was particularly interested in her treatment of the “two cultures” debates, which take the form of a binary opposition from classical times. The late phase is marked by a shift in the latter half of the twentieth century from social and class contexts for humanities scholarship (Leavis and Snow) to a professional context (Sokal and the <i>Social Text</i> collective) and an intemperate tone to the exchanges between the disputants. Rather than change anything, the debates’ value lay in their engaging a wider public in matters of academic interest (36-38). For Small, advancing a case for the humanities based on a sharp distinction between two intellectual cultures would not be satisfactory because it would make antagonists of the social sciences (4), even though they are presented as having a “scientific wing” (57). Nonetheless, a claim for the distinctiveness of the humanities needs to be made and the most general form which it can take is: “The humanities study the meaning-making practices of human culture, past and present, focusing on interpretation and critical evaluation, primarily in terms of the individual response and with an ineliminable element of subjectivity” (57). This work is a “cultural good” (176) which must be preserved.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Toby Miller, <i>Blow Up the Humanities</i></p>
<p>Miller’s vigorous anatomising of the state of the humanities in the United States in the context of profound shifts in societies and economies globally leads to his proposing a new formation, a third humanities, which is to displace what he describes as the “banal Arnoldian training of Humanities One and the supine vocational training of Humanities Two” (a result of the massification of higher education and its class division between acquiring civilisation or employability) with “a blend of political economy, textual analysis, ethnography, and environmental studies such that students learn the materiality of how meaning is made, conveyed, and discarded” (105). The force of this argument derives from the double significance of modern media technologies: understanding the significance of the culturally productive relations between author, text, and reader has become much more complex with the development of new media technologies and their integration in digitally networked media; and the rapidly expanding economic role of cultural production in the creative industries, together with the cultural diversification of nation-states under economic globalisation, has utterly changed the conditions for humanities knowledge work. This line of thought leads Miller to two conclusions: that the humanities must engage with the world in which their materials and students circulate, and that this engagement is necessarily political. Cultural studies as a “tendency” rather than a discipline (107-108), and media studies rather than history or literature as the core of humanities study, locate the constituent parts of a third humanities. As he writes in conclusion, “Here is the future for the humanities: comprehensive, omnibus survey courses about how meaning is made, circulated and received in all media – running across science, capital, fiction, sport, news, history and politics” (122).</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>Challenging (the) Humanities</i> ed Tony Bennett Australian Academy for the Humanities Occasional Paper No.? (Canberra, 2013)</p>
<p class="noindent1">In his introduction to this collection of papers given at the 2012 Symposium of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, Tony Bennett defines the focus of the Symposium as “a set of issues which […] have their origin in debates that are likely to have longer term consequences in reconfiguring the intellectual landscapes both within humanities disciplines, and between those disciplines and other knowledge clusters” (xi). Its most immediate point of local reference is the 1991 Symposium, <i>Beyond the Disciplines. The New Humanities</i>, which provides a means by which the developing challenge of new intellectual formations to the foundational conceptions of the humanities can be identified. These challenges are “presented by the posthuman and material ‘turns’ that are now in evidence across the social sciences and the humanities” (xii). A striking consequence of this double perspective – a previous Australian symposium, and intellectual formations which, if they do not typically have an (inter)national origin, are not specific either to the humanities or to Australian intellectual culture – is a volume in which groups of papers consider conceptual problems generated by these “turns” using typically Australian settings and problems. Two concerning indigeneity are located with some symbolic force at the centre of the collection, marking how concepts formed internationally are contextualised and their significance elaborated by their passage through local settings and specific histories. In principle, nothing at either end of this interchange remains unaffected by it; and, as Bennett observes, not least the “values and dispositions” which inform the practices and subject formation of academic humanists (xxv).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Each of these studies sought to understand the present complexities facing the humanities by providing ways of thinking which locate the issues in national or regional contexts and as they are shaped by cultural and historical differences. My own argument to this point has sought to establish some parameters for defining the scope of the domain of a new humanities as constituted by a particular kind of objects which are in themselves worlds, are multiply linked to other worlds, and move through social space in unpredictable ways, from the most public and open to the most specialised and closed institutional and personal contexts of interaction. If the objects of scientific enquiry are everything that makes up the physical or given world, about and from which knowledge is derived (and including human modifications of and additions to that world), the objects of humanities enquiry are semiotic objects composed with any sign system, form and media technology or any combination of them and in their totality constituting the semiosphere. If the given world is not unique to humanity, the semiosphere is: as Brier affirms, among humans, “signs are organized into language through social self-conscious communication. Accordingly, our social universe is organized as and through texts” (2008: 100).</p>
<p class="noindent1">It has become conventional to equate the humanities with academic humanities, because it is only in the university that this form of knowledge is now readily distinguishable. But it is important to recollect the distinguishing qualities of humanistic knowledge in the world at large: diffusive and accumulative, as the HUMANZ Research Policy 1996 defined them, and made of the same stuff as the objects providing the material for thought. It is also important to be more specific about some of the critical features of semiotic objects in order to clarify the implications of the difference of the humanities to the technosciences in the universal human process of knowledge creation, and to transcend the limits of the account offered by implication by the conventional disciplinary array of kinds of knowledge currently representing the work of the academic humanities. The terms to be discussed further here are Text, Languages and Translation, Medium, Writing, and Reading.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.16"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-16">4.1 <i>Text</i></a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Texts are artefacts, intentional, social and technological objects composed from the matter of sign systems and media forms and shaped by their institutional and cultural context of composition and their communicative purpose. Brier puts the issue in a way which emphasises their human origin: “Manifest cultural objects are not real in the way natural objects are – they are fictional. This goes for works of art and the architecture of buildings and machines, although the parts they consist of are natural objects or ‘matter’” (Brier, 2008: 139). Because the term text is still generally associated with print forms and their virtual instantiations, on the one hand, and with texts having a primary reference to actuality (a legal or historical document, a documentary film, etc.) I am using the term text as the most inclusive term for all the kinds of semiotic objects (the material objects constituting the semiosphere), whatever the medium, language or system of signs in which they are composed and disseminated and whatever their purpose.<sup><a id="note62" href="#note_62">62</a></sup> Not that the term is uncomplicated; in its conventional use it refers to the primarily alphanumeric component of a semiotic object, its “content”. What is at stake here is nothing less than a very long tradition in Western thought, in which truth, to be mentally apprehended as such, had to be separated from its material vehicle. Furthermore, what particularly matters here is the recognition that the medium in which information is instantiated is not a neutral channel but is intrinsic to the meaning of that information.<sup><a id="note63" href="#note_63">63</a></sup> To regard the vehicle as an integral or formative component of the knowledge/truth it conveys transforms the significance of the medium in thinking about the creation and circulation of knowledge, notably because it recognises that there is no access to or conservation of knowledge except by means of a media technology, a human invention the design of which is infused with human characteristics, qualities and values. This position includes science, in the texts of which the multiple meanings and forms characteristic of the social uses of communicational media have to be rigorously suppressed if the exactness of scientific knowledge is to be preserved.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Each text occurs at a multi-dimensional intersection: there is the totality of the semiosphere; the totality of the given world; the time-space specifics (historical, cultural, geo-political, socio-economic) of the locality in which the text is composed; the singularity of the person or collectivity writing or reading it. McGann thinks in terms of the textual field; textual space is characterised as n-dimensional, a “multivariate manifold” (2001, 179): “although the formal structure of pagespace is planar and two-dimensional, the forms of pagespace can be made to generate themselves through n-dimensional orders” (149). What a new text instantiates extends the boundaries of the semiosphere in however imperceptible a way; it may configure relations between elements of the given world such that their meaning in culture is modified or disrupted; it may alter the possibilities for thought in a specific time and place, or in many disjoined times and places; it may alter how the singularity of the person or collectivity composing it is conceived by them and/or by those encountering the text.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Each text is, to some degree and unpredictably, an agent of change. As a new object in the semiosphere, a text may be the means to generate new physical objects, whether in nature (for example, biotechnology, nanotechnology) or in society (for example, architecture, media technology, fashion). But, of course, a text may also serve a conservative purpose, aiming to reproduce, entrench or highlight valued components of existing knowledge. Even with this deliberate purpose, however, such a text will still be marked by the temporal, locational, cultural and personal contexts of its composition, all of which will be modified as it enters the different situations of its readers.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Lotman defines a text as “an isolated, self-contained semiotic function, with its integral indivisible meaning and its integral indivisible function” (47) and identifies three functions of texts: a creative function; meaning-generation; and recollection<sup><a id="note64" href="#note_64">64</a></sup>. The second refers to the inseparability of language from the content it expresses, language being both medium and sign, so that meaning is not just transferred from writer to reader in the process of communication but is actively generated in that process; the first understands a creative act through the instance of translation, in which the many versions of a translated text are possible interpretations of it and not precise equivalents, so that the translation is a new text generating new meanings as a consequence of its asymmetry with its original; and, a text is a conserver of some part of a culture’s collective memory: “the sum of the contexts in which a text acquires interpretation and which are in a way incorporated into it may be termed a text’s memory” (13-18). Lotman offers a brilliant metaphor summarising this conception of a text: “a text, like a grain of wheat which contains within itself the programme of its future development, is not something given once and for all and never changing. The inner and as yet unfinalized determinacy of its structure provides a reservoir of dynamism when influenced by contacts with new contents” (2008: 18). Another metaphor, from the beginnings of the modern period, uses the same instance of the seed, but also makes explicit both the aspect of the medium and the text’s existence through time as integral to its cultural function. In <i>The Advancement of Learning</i> (1604), Bacon brings into the foreground the profound alteration of time-space relations which is accomplished by the preservation of books, comparing printed thought to seeds and printing to a transport technology:</p>
<p class="quote">The images of men’s wits and knowledges remain in books, exempted from the wrong of time and capable of perpetual renovation. Neither are they fitly to be called images, because they generate still, and cast their seeds in the mind of others, provoking and causing infinite actions and opinions in succeeding ages. So that if the invention of the ship was thought so noble, which carrieth riches and commodities from place to place, and consociateth the most remote regions in participation of their fruits, how much more are letters to be magnified, which as ships pass though the vast seas of time, and make ages so distant to participate in the wisdom, illuminations, and inventions, the one of the other? (1974: 58-59 (I. viii. 6)).</p>
<p class="noindent1">While thinking about texts is likely to bring with it implicitly the mental model of a print book, because that has been the most intensively evolved form for the communication of formal knowledge since print technology was invented<sup><a id="note65" href="#note_65">65</a></sup>, it is important to have in mind the generality of Lotman’s definition quoted above. Every semiotic object in the semiosphere, using whatever combination of sign systems and media forms, is a text. It is only recently that texts produced outside of elite culture and in twentieth century mass media, and texts disruptive of established conventions of textuality, have become objects of analysis in the humanities, and it is even more recently that the new media forms of digitally networked communication (including txts, blogs, social media, e-literature, massively multiplayer on-line games, wikipedia) have become recognised not only as generative components of the semiosphere but as objects for investigation by humanists. The social sciences have typically led the way in the analysis of mass and new media, as witnessed by the development of Communication and Media Studies, and have in the process widened the terms of thought about the complexity of factors bearing upon the analysis and interpretation of texts, and hence upon any enquiry into what it means to be human, or the idea of humanity. Here, in a nutshell, is the reason why the space of the humanities has expanded enormously, and why a new humanities capable of engaging analytically with this extraordinary efflorescence of textuality is needed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The humanities come into existence together with the development of textual objects for objectively recording knowledge otherwise recorded by individual memories and collectively in a spoken language and cultural artefacts. It is only when that knowledge can be fixed in a material form that the humanities, as knowledge created from the deliberated analysis and interpretation of humanity’s accumulated learning about themselves and their world, can begin to develop.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.17"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-17">4.2 Languages and Translation</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">I propose to take as axioms two statements by Brier about language: “Language is at the very core of human existence” (2008: 50); and, more contentiously because of its metaphor, “Human beings are linguistic cyborgs, in that we are natural beings programmed by culture through language and therefore very much cultural products” (408). In order to fill out the implications of these propositions, I will quote a later formulation which brings together succinctly and in one place the relations in thought which go to the heart of the enterprise of the humanities:</p>
<p class="quote">As human observers we find ourselves in language and therefore in intersubjectivity with other linguistic beings. We do not have to postulate the other(s) after becoming aware of ourselves, because they are prerequisites for our becoming aware as linguistic self-conscious beings. We live in language, so to speak, and take it with us wherever we go. We cannot speak of being without knowing: if we exist but don’t know, our existence doesn’t matter. When becoming becomes aware in language it reflects on what it itself is and it realizes that it never becomes aware alone but only as a process embodied in flesh and language with others; this is fundamental to the definition of what it means to be human. Reality in the form of semiotic objects such as the other, language, culture and society, is established in the process of becoming aware (2013: 247).</p>
<p class="noindent1">One might say that every text in the semiosphere, however canonical or mundane, truth-claiming or self-presenting, is an instance of this human process of establishing reality from a position in language, society and culture. This unequivocally human ground of knowing and the kinds of expertise proper to its investigation is what authorises a claim in the humanities to create knowledge of value from the objects of the semiosphere (including the sciences as one domain), knowledge aimed at enlarging humanity’s idea of itself.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Creating such knowledge does not resolve the unresolvable plurality of human individuals, texts, languages, and cultures, which is the ground for the possibility of on-going innovations in thought and in reality. For this reason, taking as axiomatic the foundational importance of language to the formation of knowledge means also highlighting the importance of translation as an integral function in humanities knowledge work in two respects: the ability of an interpreter to read among texts in different languages, and the status of a text read in translation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Lotman’s reference to the asymmetry between versions of a text in translation implies that, at least in a university context, the plurality of languages must be as much emphasised in the constitution of the postmodern university’s work as the plurality of cultures must be. Kuokkanen’s critique of the modern Western university from the marginal position of indigenous knowledge also points clearly in this direction, as does the globally important case for language as a taonga (treasure) of a culture and its people which is made in relation, for example, to the Māori language in <i>Ko Aotearoa Tenei</i> (Vol.2, Ch. 5).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The ancient story of the Tower of Babel provides a succinct entry into this fundamental question of the multiplicity of languages, since it usually sustains the moral that the multiplicity of languages is a punishment for pride in the power of the human mind and the knowledge it can create, and brings disorder and confusion into knowledge work. To multiply languages is to frustrate communication and hence limit human power. A different conception of linguistic diversity, directly challenging this interpretation, is offered in a UNESCO report which focuses on the intimate relation between languages in their cultural environments and local contexts and emphasises the importance of “the tendency of languages to split into dialects. […] they evolve ceaselessly and constantly adapt to their environments”, affirming that “no language is inherently ‘superior’ to another; each performs its role in a specific cultural, economic, social, ecological and political context and each describes in its own particular way a different environment” (Mayor, 2001: 341, 339-40, 342). Another interpretation of the Tower of Babel, in Neal Stephenson’s novel <i>Snow Crash</i>, argues that the outcome of the judgment is positive because a multiplicity of languages prevents anyone (notably, in this novel, a media corporation) from achieving total control over human communication and information (1992: 202-203, 369-376). A third interpretation is offered by Terry Cutler: “An unintended consequence of the destruction of the Tower of Babel is the creation of diversity. And diversity is widely recognised as a pre-condition for creativity and innovation” (2008: 28).</p>
<p class="noindent1">There are many examples of the fact of linguistic diversity and its social and cultural implications, including the need for translation, but I will give several here because it is important to underline the claim that just as the search for a common language is complementary to pursuit of universally true knowledge (as suppression of minority languages is complementary to most imperial regimes and nation states controlled by a dominant ethnic group), so the link between locality and language evolution is, like the link between locality and biodiversity, critical to the generativity and adaptability of cultures and societies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have previously referred to the Treaty of Waitangi. This document, accepted as establishing the basis on which indigenous and settler populations in the territory of Aotearoa New Zealand can conduct their relations with one another, exists in two languages, Māori and English. All interpretation of the document in law and politics has to deal with the always incommensurate nature of the two texts, a situation which requires political negotiation over the meaning of this founding document because translation by itself does not remove the difference in fundamental concepts informing the customary and common law systems, the cultural principles which they enshrine, and hence its interpretation, especially in contexts remote from its composition. The point is made succinctly at the beginning of <i>Ko Aotearoa Tenei</i>. The Letter communicating the report to the relevant Minsters of the Crown from the Presiding Officer, Justice J. V. Williams, states that “We have called this report Ko Aotearoa Tenei – meaning either ‘This is Aotearoa’ or ‘This is New Zealand’, or both. The ambiguity is intentional: a reminder, if one is needed, that Aotearoa and New Zealand must be able to co-exist in the same space” (xxiii). As the report notes, the extent to which this co-existence is a reality is a direct function of the relation between the two founding languages: “Fundamentally, there is a need for a mindset shift away from the pervasive assumption that the Crown is Pākehā, English-speaking, and distinct from Māori rather than representative of them. Increasingly, in the twenty-first century, the Crown is also Māori. […] The idea of the Crown speaking Māori is of course not novel; by necessity, this was the status quo for a large proportion of New Zealand’s colonial past” (Vol. 1, 451). Another elaborated example of the real implications of translation in the context of asymmetry in cultures and histories is the discussion of rights over knowledge (Vol. 2, 78-79), which extends my earlier discussion of indigenous knowledge and the commons.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Another perspective on the linguistic and cultural interface between colonised and coloniser is given by Charles Bernstein, whose work <i>The Attack of the Difficult Poem</i>s I will take up in <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a>. He refers at one point to a translation into English from Spanish of Mapuche poetry, the original language of which is Mapudungun, and regards the volume, which presents the poems in all three languages, as an example of a crossroads, a place of encounter between different languages, cultures and histories out of which the “always plural” and syncretic identity of the Americas is continuously created, no one language being able to claim or being granted sovereignty over the others (2011: 68-70). A complementary example is Hofstadter’s and Sander’s study, <i>Surfaces and Essences. Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking</i>. This collaborative project about analogy as “thought’s core” (2013: 18) was realised in two original texts, one in French and one in English, the result of “back-and-forth exchanges between two languages”, otherwise expressed as going “around the bilingual, bicultural, bicerebral loop” (x). An extended discussion of translation in Chapter 6 demonstrates the general proposition that “<i>Genuine</i> translation – translation that merits the label ‘translation’ – is indeed about analogy-making at all levels imaginable, from the most miniscule grammatical ending of a word to the entire overarching cultural context in which the text and events and notions of which it speaks are embedded” (376). One example discussed in detail is the use of a reference to the Paris Metro in <a href="09_ST_CHR1.xhtml#ch1">the first chapter</a>, intended to locate the text in a familiar setting for a French reader; to create the same sense of familiarity for an American reader, the English version refers to an airport, not to the New York subway. So, reading one version of the book is to read the outcome of a study which could not only not avoid the differences carried by the two primary languages and cultural locations of the authors, but is enlarged by them. For a reader fluent in both languages, the outcome of this project will be richer than for a reader able to access only one of the versions; however much each version works to keep its reader in mind of the bi-lingual and bi-cultural context of the study, it will inevitably communicate its results within the terms of the cultural and knowledge framing brought to it by its reader. This does not falsify or render the work in either version less true or valid, just different. The same point is relevant to my later use of Badiou’s writings, the translation of which is extensively discussed in forewords to the translations. Like any reading, the result is both a translation and an interpretation of his texts, a process which extends and modifies their possible meanings as they travel from their context of composition to their contexts of reception. A particular instance from his work is his use of his own translations of Greek originals.<sup><a id="note66" href="#note_66">66</a></sup> One further perspective is offered by <i>Le Monde Diplomatique,</i> which is now published in 20 languages. In one respect, this is a remarkable recognition of some facts of globalisation: that “the news” and news media are global in scope and dissemination but there is not one common language in which the news can be disseminated to everyone. As I have noted above, the news in each edition cannot be “the same” since it will be interpreted into the cultural framing of the world each language effects.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In each of the instances I have mentioned, the linguistically complex and hybrid situation of the majority of the world’s population who are not native speakers of a world language like English, and who are required to be linguistically mobile if they wish to relocate outside their native language domain, is normally disguised from native speakers of a world language. Ironically, an article on translation, acknowledging the now common use of machine-assisted translation, in the context of a review of the <i>Dictionary of Untranslatables: a Philosophical Lexicon</i> (2004, English trans. 2014), includes a quotation from an Oxford Professor of Philosophy of Argentinian origin arguing that “All research in philosophy should be published in English, even research in philosophical traditions that are not represented in English. […] having a unique philosophy language (English) will make it easier for a fertile interaction between different philosophical traditions” (Miller, 2014: 16). A new humanities riposte might be that accepting the difference of different languages and thinking and writing with and between them would be the more fertile approach.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.18"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-18">4.3 Medium and Materiality</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The field of enquiry we know as the (modern) humanities came into existence together with the invention of printing as a new ICT, and has evolved in association with the techniques of printing, the design of print objects, new conceptions of authorship and the invention of institutions established to manage the productivity of printing and the creation of knowledge. Among the most highly evolved print forms are the scholarly monograph (the mind of the author shaping a diversity of interpretations and evidence in a field of enquiry into a large-scale, internally coherent argument and making that field present to the reader through footnotes and bibliography), and the novel (a large scale narrative generating an imagined world).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The difference the medium makes is succinctly defined by Mark Poster: “Each method of preserving and transmitting information profoundly intervenes in the network of relations that constitute a society” (1990: 7). His point is that everything to do with how we understand ourselves, how we relate to others in society, how we think about knowledge, how we design our institutions, is disrupted and reframed when a new information and communications technology is introduced. With respect to digital media technologies, David Porush (2007: 151-152) argues that “if humans have evolved at all since we have been aware of ourselves as humans, it is largely because of the development of communications media and technologies: language itself, then writing, the printing press, telegraph, telephone, the networked computer, immersive 3D sensory simulation, the consensual hallucination predicted in William Gibson’s 1984 nightmare of cyberspace <i>Neuromancer</i>. […] the most dramatic evolutionary push comes [from] the cybernetic gear that alter our cognition, namely, the communications technologies that mediate and activate the feedback loop between culture and cognition, moulding the plastic human brain to our artificial information environments: the 3Cs loop among Culture, Cognition, and Communications Technologies.” Both of these writers understand information and communications technologies as active agents in human evolution, without arguing that they necessarily determine that evolution. Technologies are, after all, designed by humans according to human purposes and conceptions; their effects are a consequence of human agency even if it is concealed by the apparent independence of the machine, and unintended or unanticipated by their designers.<sup><a id="note67" href="#note_67">67</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Digital and networked ICTs produce new kinds of text, as did the analogue media of the first half of the twentieth century. Photography, radio, recorded music, film, and television developed their own disciplines and archival institutions which were functionally related to the media technologies and business models which enabled the production and distribution of their texts, partly because the traditional humanities were slow to recognise the new kinds of texts as just as integral to their work as the print texts on which they were founded. With digital ICTs the challenge to the traditional humanities becomes even greater. To state the obvious, every kind of text in any medium is capable of digital representation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is only with the arrival of a new cognitive technology that what has become habitual and taken for granted in the use of a predecessor technology becomes apparent. Hence, several hundred years of increasingly extensive habituation to informational objects produced by print technology, from the earliest childhood literacy to the most sophisticated intellectual work, served to render the technological aspect invisible, so completely naturalised or internalised in cognitive behaviour did its defining features become (at least for those who achieved some mastery). As Silvio Gaggi (1997: 111) has written, “A conventional book creates the illusion that at the moment of its being read a single author addresses a single reader. In electronic networks no single author addresses any single reader, or, if one does, their exchange emerges from and immediately re-enters a broader context of multiple speakers and listeners. There is a polyphony of voices, and the authority of each of them is continually qualified by their mutually commenting on one another.”<sup><a id="note68" href="#note_68">68</a></sup> National histories of the book or, more inclusively, the history of print culture, are recent new fields of enquiry in the history of media technologies, made inevitable (even if still on the margins of humanistic scholarship), by the advent of digital ICTs. But there is also the question of humanities scholarship itself. What happens to literary interpretation, historical and philosophical analysis, conventions of evidence and conduct of argument, forms of scholarly dissemination, and modes of engagement with readers, when its digital medium uses a different rhetoric than the work of reason as it is represented by the traditional scholarly monograph?<sup><a id="note69" href="#note_69">69</a></sup> New media forms also challenge readers’ expectation of how a novel or a work of humanities scholarship may be written and published, when these expectations have been formed in accordance with the cultural and intellectual purposes served by the traditional format.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A good example is provided by the most rigorous field in the modern humanities, bibliography. By bringing the science of the description and classification of manuscript and print texts into contact with the business of printing and then media evolution, D F McKenzie extended bibliography at first into the social and institutional practices of printing and publishing (the “mechanisms” of the printing house and the market) and then to the inclusion of post-print media texts, on the one hand, and the relation between performed and print versions of texts composed for the theatre, on the other. In the latter case, consideration of the different textual identities of a play as staged, as a printed script, and as a work in a collection of an author’s works, opens on to a conception of the difference of versions as a function of the social context of performance or publication. In his 1985 Panizzi lectures, McKenzie argued for a radical extension of the discipline from its foundations in print textuality to embrace the whole spectrum of media forms, complementary to the development of cultural history and of critical changes in the work of libraries and archives in response to new media technologies, analogue and digital.<sup><a id="note70" href="#note_70">70</a></sup> His most radical extension, that “the land – not even its representation on a map, but the land itself - might be a text” (1986: 31) was more fully worked out in his paper on the Treaty of Waitangi and the significance of the signatures of Māori chiefs to that document.<sup><a id="note71" href="#note_71">71</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">In order to bring this widened scope within a disciplined concept, McKenzie offered the following definition: “bibliography is the discipline that studies texts as recorded forms, and the processes of their transmission, including their production and reception” (4). Bibliography, understood in this way, is clearly the name for the fundamental theory and method of the new humanities, since it concerns everything that has been comprehended by the traditional humanities disciplines, and is now by media and cultural studies. It is founded on a theory of the text as a physical object (45), inclusive of all media forms and hence embracing the totality of the semiosphere: it is “committed to the description of all recorded texts. In principle, it is comprehensive, and indiscriminate” (51), and therefore concerns itself with the founding evidence for any discipline analysing and interpreting a society’s cultural production. It requires a conception of both the uniqueness of each text as a function of the specifics of its origin – author, time, place, media technology, institution, audience – and its evolutionary relationship to other texts, those preceding it, those providing its immediate context, and those with which it will engage through future readers and writers. This double conception is critical for grounding the cultural historical work of investigating meaning: as a “locatable, describable, attributable, datable and explicable object, the text as a recorded form is, pre-eminently, a bibliographical fact”; but also, a text is “always incomplete, and therefore open, unstable, subject to a perpetual re-making by its readers, performers, or audience” (45). Put more strongly, “the ostensible unity of any one ‘contained’ text – be it in the shape of a manuscript, book, map, film, or computer-stored file – is an illusion” (50), the theatre providing a specific instance which supports the view that “texts are perhaps best seen, not as fixed, determined artefacts in a specific medium, but as potential” (41).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Although the textual examples McKenzie discusses to support his claims for bibliography are taken mostly from literature, and hence have authors, there is nothing in his general theory which requires a single author origin for a text, or that a text should have high cultural value. As he observed, addressing bibliographically the diversity of textual objects produced by printing exposes one to “the full range of social realities which the medium of print had to serve, from receipt blanks to bibles” and requires consideration of “the human motives and intentions which texts involve at every stage of their production, transmission and consumption. It alerts us to the role of institutions, and their own complex structures, in affecting the forms of social discourse, past and present” (6-7).</p>
<p class="noindent1">McKenzie’s expansion of the scope of bibliography to include all text objects, whether those of interest to the traditional academic humanities, or media studies, or the totality of cultural production which in principle is the scope of cultural studies, has been further elaborated with the publication of Kirschenbaum’s <i>Mechanisms. New Media and the Forensic Imagination</i> which reframes bibliography as a science of the digital or electronic text. If one of McKenzie’s achievements was to analyse the complex role of the printing house in the final form of a print text, Kirschenbaum does the same for the role of the computer in text production. In his preface to his book he refers to “the complex nature of transmission and inscription in digital settings […] our current theories and points of reference for reckoning with electronic textuality were inadequate when parsed against what I had come to understand as the material matrix governing writing and inscription in all forms: erasure, variability, repeatability, and survivability” (2008: xii-xiii). It is hard to underestimate the importance of this conception of the “material matrix”; within the axes of the I-space the four terms constituting the matrix magnify the variable effects of time on any text and provide analytical concepts precisely adjusted to the distinctive characteristics of texts as physical objects existing in and through material and social spaces and times.</p>
<p class="noindent1">While “textual studies should be regarded as among the most sophisticated branches of media studies we have evolved”, he notes that “textual critics have tended to treat the computer mainly as a platform-independent venue for studying the artifacts of <i>other</i> media” (16). By contrast, he affirms that, in general, “All media are bound to the materialities of their particular forms […] all media remain part of a social, political, and economic landscape whose shifting contours resist any attempt at erosion through the mere rhetorical invocation of homogenous zones of ones and zeroes” (106).<sup><a id="note72" href="#note_72">72</a></sup> For an electronic text, these materialities include the recording medium, software, and its screen representation (3), and the need to engage with these aspects of a digital text is fully explored in case studies of three texts, including Michael Joyce’s <i>Afternoon</i> and its complex version history, and William Gibson’s poem <i>Agrippa</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Kirschenbaum proposes two analytical dimensions for text analysis, which roughly parallel McKenzie’s pair of medium and form, forensic and formal materiality. He locates his introduction of the term “forensic” in a cultural and technological history, on the grounds that “as a legal and scientific enterprise forensic examination has its origins in the same nineteenth-century era that produced the great inscribing engines of modernity – the gramophone, film, and the typewriter among them”. Forensics is “a signature discourse network of modernity at the juncture of instrumentation, inscription, and identification” (250), and it “rests upon the principle of individuation […] the idea that no two things in the physical world are ever exactly alike” (10). Furthermore, “electronic textuality is almost always automated textuality – which is to say that most of the textual events in a modern operating system, or network, occur without the impetus of human agency” (83).</p>
<p class="noindent1">A fundamental strand in the development of thinking about textuality indicated here is emphasis upon the materiality of a text as a source of its difference from other texts, including from itself when “it” is published in more than one medium, and the increasing mechanising of writing and transmission processes. Instead of separating content from vehicle, as though the medium were only a neutral channel or surface by means of which informational content is transported to a recipient, and so replicating the traditional mind/body distinction in conceptions of the human, bibliographical theory and practice as exemplified here by McKenzie and Kirschenbaum provides for a much fuller and more responsive account of the generation of the momentary meaning of a text by taking into account as constituent factors in its potential meaning the technological, cultural, social, ideological, economic, institutional, political, and media contexts of its production and reception. However widely the boundaries of the term bibliography may be extended, it still turns back to its origin in the medium of printing and the form of the book; a new humanities needs a new term for its foundational theory.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Humanities scholars who have addressed the implications of medium shifts have produced powerful insights into the relation between knowledge creation, media forms and institutional practices. A directly relevant instance is the work of David Jay Bolter and others in both theorising the implications of digital technologies for knowledge work and the new kinds of text which the new technologies could make possible, and creating software which enabled their theorising to be explored in practice. Out of this work came innovative authoring software, Storyspace, for the writing and reading of e-literature, with a full historical and theoretical context in <i>Writing Space</i> and a publishing enterprise, Eastgate Systems<sup><a id="note73" href="#note_73">73</a></sup>, which made available new literary compositions to a readership interested in the potential for literature of the new digital technologies as writing and reading machines.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To digitise a print text and re-present it on a computer screen is not just a different instantiation of the same text, but it is a process of translation for which Bolter and Grusin invented the term remediation. It was formulated to account for the persistence of previous media forms in new media environments, one example being the creation of digital editions of print texts. It is not that one medium simply replaces another, the medium being an indifferent factor; instead, what needs to be attended to is “the cycling of different media through one another” (1999: 5). Hayles states succinctly a critical consequence of interaction between media forms: “To change the material artifact is to transform the context and circumstances for interacting with the words, which inevitably changes the meaning of the words as well” (2002: 23-24). The most important differences are the ways in which information (that is, semiotic materials) can be structured and combined digitally and texts in different media can be brought into close association in a computing environment, which Gaggi describes as “a horizonless conceptual space” (1997: 111) in which “small t” texts are nodes in a network or “capital T” Text and relations between texts and readers are constituted as much or more by the characteristics of the network as they are by the writer’s intention to create and communicate meaning and the formal structuring and categorising of a particular text.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The concept of remediation does not only apply to the shift from print to digital; it also highlights aspects of print texts which have been previously overlooked. As Hayles argues, “By and large literary critics have been content to see literature as immaterial verbal constructions, relegating to the specialized fields of bibliography, manuscript culture, and book production the rigorous study of the materiality of literary artifacts.” (2002: 19). A striking example is a text book in media philosophy by Mark Taylor and Esa Saarinen, <i>Imagologies.</i> This extraordinary book materialised an experiment in distance teaching between Finland and the United States, in which the media of communication, representation and instruction were analysed by engaging theory with textual and communicational practice. At the heart of the experiment were the screen and the sign, the page openings of the book being treated as white screen spaces (interfaces) inscribed with black verbal and visual signs, using font variations, unusual alignments of words and paragraphs in the page space, and shifts in register from theory to conversational exchange.<sup><a id="note74" href="#note_74">74</a></sup> Each opening presented a challenge to its readers to make sense of arrays of signs whose unconventional arrangements themselves were a critique of modern academic conventions of argumentative form and rational enquiry, as they were of televisual and computational screen conventions of representation and narration. A crucial concept in the book’s creation was the importance of design in visual and digital media; the book was designed by a designer for Marimekko, Marjaana Verta.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent1">If <i>Imagologies</i> remediates the form and purpose of the academic book in the context of twentieth century media technological evolution and the challenges to media conventions in twentieth century art and philosophy<i>,</i> to follow the publishing history of an electronic novel like Joyce’s <i>Afternoon</i> (1989 – ) is to follow the various materialisations of digital technology as its publication media (which were also storage devices) evolved from disks to the web.<sup><a id="note75" href="#note_75">75</a></sup> As Kirschenbaum demonstrates in his discussion of <i>Afternoon</i>, software as well as hardware are significant factors. Joyce was a co-author of the authoring software, Storyspace, with which he wrote <i>Afternoon</i>: “Storyspace has its own version history, separate and distinct from that of <i>Afternoon</i>. Its stability in turn depends upon that of the Macintosh operating system” (2008: 162). The work of cultural and textual theorists like N Katherine Hayles, Alan Liu, Jerome McGann and Joseph Tabbi (a practical expression of which is the development of the Electronic Literature Organisation), and the formation of a field of theory and practice under the term digital humanities (see below) all testify to the extraordinary potential for knowledge work and artistic practice of the new medium, and for its critical importance in the formation of a new humanities.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.19"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-19">4.4 “Writing is a technology of the mind”</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">This aphorism<sup><a id="note76" href="#note_76">76</a></sup> located the core principle of the writing movement as it began in the 1970s and evolved through the 1980s and 1990s, mostly in the United States, into a new discipline typically formed out of English Literature programmes where the teaching of Freshman Composition was located. It grew out of a critique of introductory writing courses, perceived as creating the impression that writing is a skill which could be learned in a dedicated, one-off course, like any other practical skill – riding a bicycle, for instance. I think it is also fair to say that it was part of the 1960s and 70s challenge to Cold War authoritarianism, in which subjects of the disciplinary orders of society (readers) were encouraged to become creators of a new society (writers). Writing was reconceptualised as a cognitive technology and complex social practice, especially across academic disciplines and among professions. It drew on the theorising of writers such as Derrida, Barthes, Foucault, Ellis, Ong, Goody and Finnegan, and its many branches came to include writing across the curriculum, writing for the disciplines, graduate writing and document design. It is important to emphasise that this movement grew in and out of educational contexts, both school and university, and it quickly came to intersect with another new cognitive technology, computing, and to be informed by another strand of historical and cultural enquiry initiated at the same time, the role of print technology in cultural, intellectual and economic development.<sup><a id="note77" href="#note_77">77</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">A powerful edge to the movement was given by the recognition that historically, and still in many ways in the present, the teaching of reading and writing had been disjoined, and that states where citizen literacy was important as a means of distance communication and social administration were more interested in having their citizens as recipients capable only of one-way communication, that is, as readers rather than writers. Hence state control of the uses of the early printing press, which was otherwise just as capable of being used by individuals to publish their views to a wider public as networked personal computers are. The force of this perception was underlined by the development of mass communications in the twentieth century, and particularly the aggregation into both public and private media systems of visual and electronic media, by which citizens were positioned as consumers (readers) of media texts (commodities) without the means to use these mass media communication technologies as producers (writers). None of these developments were technologically determined; just as with print technology in the centuries following its invention, the application of these new technologies was ideologically and culturally shaped, whether by democratic capitalism and communism culminating in the period of the Cold War or, later, by the social and economic theories underpinning neoliberalism. But an important effect of thinking of writing as a cognitive technology was to extend the scope of the term from alphanumeric literacy to multi-media literacy; in other words, to the ability in principle if not in practice to use any of the semiotic and media systems which had evolved for the conservation and communication of knowledge and meaning. The more recent advocacy for information literacy in this context only appears new because the business interests producing digital technologies realised that the large-scale adoption of this new information and communications technology was dependent upon a population able to use it. And the core competence, as with print, was alphanumeric literacy; the critical difference (social and political) was that the new machines were both transmitters and receivers, decentralising the production process of twentieth century mass media and potentially equalising the roles of reader and writer, but also requiring the internalisation of machinic procedures and forms previously outsourced to the publisher and the printing house.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If a new humanities is intrinsically linked to current and evolving cognitive technologies, the longer historical point is that this has always been the case. The humanities as a distinctive body of knowledge and a set of practices for creating that knowledge have their origin in the interactive formation of two technologies – of cities as machines for generating knowledge, meaning and value, and of writing as the means of recording and hence objectifying, collecting and exposing to critique over time a society’s knowledge. The past century in particular has seen an extraordinary evolution in the information and communication technologies fundamental to the operation of modern and now postmodern societies and nations in a globalising world order: the same issues of control over and freedom in their use which surfaced at the beginning of printing and were focussed for that phase by Milton’s <i>Areopagitica</i> have both continued and in many ways become more intense in this latest phase of their evolution. And so it is by observing the double character of citizens as readers and writers, recipients of the information flows of their society and contributors to those flows, especially in the political domain of democratic governance, that expanding and regrounding the scope of the humanities must be attempted. If literacy, the fundamental cognitive and technical competence required for humanities knowledge work, requires semiotic fluency (initially alphanumeric, ideographic or hieroglyphic handwriting on clay, papyrus, paper or stone), then postmodern humanities knowledge work requires semiotic fluency in the variety of sign systems, media forms and media technologies now commonly used to formulate, communicate and conserve thought in postmodern societies. It is only in the universities that this thought is carried on in its administered form inherited from the print history of discipline formation, with the effect that new media disciplines have evolved on the margins of the now traditional humanities or in social sciences (just as Writing as a distinct field of theory and practice grew up in Literature programmes and then departed, often into a closer association with Linguistics).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Writing must be now understood, as a result of the development of mass media and digital ICTs, to embrace composition and expression of thought in any system of signs and media, or combination of them, whether alphanumeric, audio, visual (pictorial, graphic, video), or gestural (sculptural, theatrical).<sup><a id="note78" href="#note_78">78</a></sup> This list is deliberately presented on an axis from most to least abstract, most symbolic to most embodied; but there are clearly other axes which would modify the arrangement. All writing is visual in that it requires inscription on a surface of some kind in order to communicate at a distance, or to be recovered as a record, whether or not its primary modality is computer code or print or performance (music and dance notation). All writing produces texts (the objects making up the semiosphere), which can be classified in many different ways, for example, by knowledge field and institution, genre and medium, art form, social purpose, history, geography, natural languages. Another spectrum by which texts can be related to one another in their relation to the work of knowledge production is constituted by the terms creative and expository. The former typically signifies the opening of new possibilities of knowledge, and the latter the clear and validated, impersonal presentation of what is currently known and knowable.<sup><a id="note79" href="#note_79">79</a></sup> But this distinction, like that between academic and popular, typically entrenches a value distinction between the new and the second-hand which misrepresents knowledge creation in the humanities. Of course, any text at the creative end of the spectrum will employ existing knowledge, just as any expository text may open a previously unconsidered possibility within its field, or in another when read in that context. The diversity of possible categories itself manifests the complexity of human societies and cultures, and the way in which each text acquires its uniqueness from its selection from and combination of the semiotic and media resources available to writers and their readers in a specific time and place.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In its modality as document design, writing theory and practice demonstrates another decisive aspect of postmodern ICT development, whether the text is a web page, a print book, a news item accessed through a television channel, a legal or administrative document, an advertisement, an email. All of these texts can be now digitally mediated, but they remediate earlier, pre-digital forms in their design, and they communicate effectively in so far as all of their components are intentionally combined to shape a reader’s or viewer’s thought and response. The shift to the individual as the producer of texts which are self-published and can be globally disseminated requires either the ability to employ both knowledge and form in the composition of a text, even when the form is provided by a template, as in email or word processing. For the humanities as a critical textual practice, this requires understanding cultural assumptions, meanings and constraints which are embedded (usually invisibly) in the design of a form. Document design demonstrated that designing a form was as much an authorial process as writing a play or a technical manual, since all authorial processes depend for their success or failure on the ability of the written text to address its recipient at a distance from its origin and accomplish the purpose it is intended to serve. And critical to that success is the ability of the text, through its design, to lead its reader into a full comprehension of its purpose. Like literature, a successful manual seeks to model imaginatively actual or possible real-world situations and behaviour with which the reader may not have had any prior acquaintance. As the guide in a learning situation, it has a close similarity to education in that the skill of the manual writer, as with the teacher, consists in allowing the reader to internalise the writer/teacher’s knowledge and replicate (and modify) it in practice. Computer and other digital device manuals were (and are) exemplary of this problem, failing to the extent that their writers fail to objectify their own expert and tacit knowledge and how-to learning.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.20"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-20">4.5 Reading as Understanding and Interpreting</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">At a late point in Roberto Savioni’s powerful analysis of narco-trafficking, he unexpectedly affirms the importance of reading:</p>
<p class="quote">Nothing is more powerful than reading, no-one is a greater liar than he who holds that reading a book is a passive gesture. To read, hear, study and understand – these are the only ways to construct a life beyond life, life alongside of life. Reading is a dangerous act, because it gives shape and dimensions to words, it incarnates and disperses them in all directions. It turns everything upside down and makes change and tickets and lint fall out of the pockets of the world. To get to know narco-trafficking, to get to know the rationality of evil and money, to rip open the veil that obscures the supposed familiarity with the world. To know is the first step towards change. (2015: 375)</p>
<p class="noindent1">The reader (viewer, hearer) occupies the other human position in the communicative exchange mediated by a text, a position multiplied as often as the means for dissemination permit. With the advent of reception theory in the late 1960s , the author ceased being taken to be the sole determinant of a text’s meaning; the reader became an active participant whose interpretive work could extend, revise or challenge the claims to knowledge and meaning made by the text. One of the ways by which texts open possibilities for new knowledge is through the intersection between them and a reader’s stock of knowledge (thought of as an individual selection from the contents of the semiosphere, modified by experience; a cultural inventory) and the interpretive relationship which this conjunction of textual and experiential knowledge sets up. In the theory of knowledge put forward by Brier, knowledge held by a text remains only a potential of the text until it is engaged by a reader’s mind, where it is inevitably modified by its contact with the reader’s own stock of knowledge.<sup><a id="note80" href="#note_80">80</a></sup> The point to be taken here is that the process of thinking typically generated by a momentary conjunction between objectified knowledge (a text) and an individual subject should be understood to be interpretive and evaluative, not passively receptive, and hence potentially generative and open, meaning forming rather than meaning finalising in unpredictable ways. Gaggi compares the interactivity of reading and writing in a hypertextual environment with conversation, noting that “Hypertext – like a conversation – encourages a value system that emphasises the solving of problems and the growth of learning to and for the good of the community as a whole, rather than one that insists individuals must be recognized and rewarded for the exact part they have played in that communal endeavour” (1997: 106-107). I will later make the case that this value system is intrinsic to any conception of a new humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The conception of what constitutes literate competence in post-print textuality has to include both reading and writing in the diversity of media forms and technologies now woven into ordinary social life in democratic societies (a more complex conception of information literacy than the ability to use a networked computer). Having argued that creativity needs to be thought of as a population-wide quality, Hartley points out that the recent and dramatic expansion of the semiosphere has meant that the print era’s association between access to literacy and to information as the mark of a democratic society is no longer sufficient. No longer, he argues, are we</p>
<p class="quote">in a cultural universe where individual access to creative culture – that is, literacy - can be seen as emancipationist in itself […] Now, the information universe is too large – or in economic terms transaction costs are too high – for mere access to ensure intellectual freedom; organizational forms and interactions also determine how individual agency operates in practice. New attention is needed to trace and understand the role of <i>selection, management, order, and redaction</i> (creative editing of existing material) in networks and archives even as they continue to expand faster than exponentially (2012: 54, author’s emphasis).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Systems and institutions are integral components of social networks, and their enabling and coordinating functions in the work of creating and exchanging information and knowledge need to be fully understood by and in the new humanities. Knowledge about them clearly also needs to inform the literacy that underpins the possibility of knowledgable citizen participation in the on-going production and reproduction of democratic societies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Reading, writing and interpretation (the work practices of humanities enquiry) are the result of what Derrida (1992: 16) describes as “an experience [which] is a traversal, something that <i>traverses</i> and travels toward a destination for which it finds the appropriate passage” – but not the inevitable or only passage to a pre-determined meaning. In another context, discussing the question of “The Book to Come”, Derrida refers to “<i>the tension between gathering and dispersion</i>” as characterising “the new space of writing and reading in electronic writing, travelling at top speed from one spot on the globe to another, and linking together, beyond frontiers and copyrights, not only citizens of the world on the universal network of a potential <i>universitas</i>, but also any reader as a writer, potential or virtual or whatever” (2005: 13, 15, author’s emphasis). Here electronic writing links citizen minds across the I-space, throughout the semiosphere, and engages the whole spectrum of possibilities from closed/gathered to chaotic/dispersed in the generation of new meaning. This new space is the space in which the productivity of new humanities knowledge work is to be located.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If texts in a digital environment can be multi-lingual, multi-medial, multi-generic, and the traditional boundary between creative and critical writing is blurred, then extensions of what is understood by literacy in the humanities are necessary, most especially at the advanced professional level of humanities scholarship and its associated professions. It is no longer enough for the academic humanities to be grounded in sophisticated print literacy, symbolised by the scholarly monograph, or in separate disciplines based on expertise in reading and writing in one or more of the new media forms of the twentieth century. As a reading and writing machine, the networked computer does not inherently differentiate between media forms, privilege some over others, or respect modern discipline boundaries. In this way it exemplifies the conditions of post-modern knowledge, including the conditions for a new humanities.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s2.21"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-21">4.6 Design</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">There is one domain of expert knowledge and practice which brings together the features of the semiosphere which I have identified as constitutive, and which can provide a relevant perspective for thinking about the scope and nature of a new humanities, as well as a dimension of expert knowledge directly implicated in the interpretive work of the humanities and its social applications. Semiotic objects are designed objects, and it has been conventional in the period of print to regard the technological expertise required to publish intellectual work as secondary to the work itself, even if production values defined claims to significance, market value, or access by particular groups of readers (as in fine printing or artist’s books). This distinction was repeated in the distinction between the fine and applied arts. But the advent of digital technologies as multimedia writing and publishing machines (now also as 3-D printers) and the role of design in discriminating between versions of the same object in consumer markets, has collapsed the distinction between fine and applied arts and foregrounded the way in which all artefacts are inherently communicative of values aesthetically by design.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As a field of expert knowledge, design can also be considered as an integral dimension of the I-space, and the way that design knowledge works in the world can be seen to be exactly comparable to the way humanities knowledge works. In their study, <i>The Design Way,</i> Nelson and Stolterman make a foundational claim, that “Outside of nature, [designers] are the prime creators of our experienced reality” (2003: 9). They are concerned to overturn an ancient structure of value which has placed design knowledge outside formal knowledge, a situation aggravated by the intense focus in Western societies on science and technology and the modes of thought required by those fields of enquiry and application of knowledge. Their study is directly aimed at recovering an integrated and historically grounded conception of design: “it is now critical that we pick up these frayed design threads, and weave them into new patterns, integrating their wisdom into a more holistic fabric of life” (23). This is not to disparage science, but to determine just what part technoscientific knowledge properly plays in the design process and its outcomes. With respect to my interests, every page of this book resonates with the conception of the work of humanities knowledge, its origins, its purposes and its embeddedness in our humanity, which I am advancing. One consequence of thinking about design holistically is the judgment that “Science cannot provide insight into what <i>should</i> be brought into existence, through intention, imagination and innovation. It can only assist” (31). By placing their argument in the inclusive and heterogeneous context of the “fabric of life”, they locate exactly the context which also frames the work of the humanities and, at the same time, challenges assumptions within the academic humanities about disciplined knowledge work and its purpose. To overwrite “design” with “humanities” in the following quotation is to bring to bear, in one place, all the critical parameters for thinking about the work humanities knowledge does in our world:</p>
<p class="quote">Design is about evoking, or creating, the real. […] The scientific and analytic tools available to us are not designed to handle the real: at least not in any holistic sense, because, from a design perspective, the real is a whole. Any new design is therefore, something that is both real and whole. As such, that new design is, by definition, too complex and rich to be completely understood during the process of creation. We cannot predict with accuracy how any design will serve the world and, in turn, how it will change it (45).</p>
<p class="noindent1">At the heart of this conception of knowledge lies a relationship between actual people (not abstractions) brought together to realise a desire or address a human problem by making something new, thus modifying “experienced reality”. This qualification to the term reality is crucial for marking the ways in which humanly created things both exist materially in the world and gain their identity, purpose and functionality from the ideas which inform their creation. “Experienced reality” and its textual modification are also integral to the new knowledge work of the humanities as well. Writer and reader constitute a relationship of meaningfulness through a real world object, a text, intended to have real world effects, but effects which cannot be definitively predicted not least because of the designed object’s ability to be present in times and places removed from that of its origin. I intend to draw more on this study. The force of its case has been subtly imagined by William Gibson in his short story, ‘The Gernsback Continuum”, in which the 1930s are identified (from the perspective of their urban remnants in the 1970s) as the period in which people started to desire the future (1986/7: 26).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Two examples will serve to show how the convergence of print, computing and design makes possible further developments in writing and new kinds of text and extends the space of the new humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The first is provided by Nick Bantock. His fictional books are written by him in the double sense that he creates both a verbal narrative and painterly images, and the books’ designer Barbara Hodgson clearly plays a major role in the integration of the diverse materials which constitute the text. Books like <i>The Venetian’s Wife</i> (1996) and <i>The Forgetting Room</i> (1997) represent an extraordinary response to the virtual realism characteristic of the design conventions governing television and computing displays. They are superbly produced compositions of image fragments and verbal narrative or exposition, the fragments often being objects, or representations of objects, which are named in or have some analogical relation to narrated events or the exposition of a topic.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Two aspects of their composition as books are closely related: the artistic practice of collage and the treatment of the page as if it were a computer screen have in common the combining of discrete graphical objects in one writing space. In contrast to the normal visual and audio noise and activity of websites, Bantock’s page arrays work aesthetically to encourage “committed inspection” (2004: 111) by the reader of what each page displays. To take two examples from <i>The Venetian’s Wife.</i> A museum curator, Sarah Wolfe, buys a set of nineteenth-century encyclopedias at an auction which she describes as “full of illustrations that I can scan into my computer and use with my diary entries.” Four beautifully detailed images of insects take up the middle third of the page following this comment, and one sits like a marginal note adjacent to it (49). The verbal narrative is carried forward through emails between Sarah and Nicolo Conti, who has employed her to locate four sculptures missing from his art collection, and Sarah’s updating of her computer diary, as well as through copies of pages from a damaged nineteenth century diary, the catalogue of an exhibition of collages by Alexander Lorac from a gallery in New Orleans, and a diversity of images. Just as verbal, visual and graphic signs interact on each page and opening (roughly the area of an iMac 17 inch screen), so they do in the collages, which are composed of images and image fragments of objects, languages, texts. In a later reflection on the process of collage composition, <i>Urgent 2<sup>nd</sup> Class</i> (2004), Bantock adopts what I would call a democratic position on the making of art works, seeking to develop “a strong sense of aesthetic within the everyday” (5). He is also concerned to challenge “a society where cold, hard and shiny are often highly valued” (1). By taking ephemera as the materials to compose with, Bantock argues that the textual object (a fact) is combined by the artist with other semiotic objects, bringing into existence a fiction, a “fascinating world […] that never quite was but almost might have been. A place of visual poetry […]” (2). Another way of putting this creative outcome is to be found in a comment on Lorac’s work; with no experience of Asia, he employs examples of its “ephemeral cultural remains” to “create a world suffused in the light of his own mind’s eye” (37). Not just the real thing, but the real as experienced and objectified in a work of art.</p>

<p class="noindent1">The second example comes from an instance of new humanities literary criticism. In 2002 N. Katherine Hayles published a small book, <i>Writing Machines</i>, which elaborated her thinking about digital writing and (like <i>Imagologies</i>) advertised its difference from traditional humanities academic book publication through its design. Because such a project typically requires collaboration, the creation of the book as a textual object was shared between her and the text’s designer, Anne Burdick. Burdick describes the print book as “a tool for storage and retrieval, as the first home of Literature, as a navigational device, a writing space, and a representation of knowledge”, thus marking its remediation from the perspective of computing. One example of the many ways in which <i>Writing Machines</i> rethinks the communicative work of the book as a visual and material form is its use of three fonts to represent different “voices”, one for each of the personal and the theoretical and a melding of the two for the personal-theoretical (141-142). The print version followed the text’s initial digital publication in an electronic or web format, and both versions in content and presentation manifest new thinking in the literary and critical dimensions of the humanities. A new kind of publisher was also needed to make these new modalities of writing accessible, exemplified by Peter Lunenfeld, the Editorial Director of MediaWorks, when he refers in the Endtroduction to mutations in “this world of multi-, trans-, inter-, and re-mediation” (138) and by Hayles’s intimate involvement in the formation of the Electronic Literature Organisation.</p>

<h3 class="sec1" id="s2.22"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-22">4.7 Digital Humanities</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">“The Internet is the largest information space in human history and it is quite literally uncharted and unchartered territory” (Deegan and Sutherland, 2009: 174).</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the humanities as a scholarly, knowledge-creating enterprise developed in step with the evolution of writing and print, the genealogical line of the most important development in cognitive technologies in the past half-century - networked computing or digital information and communications technologies (ICTs) - finds its ancestral roots in the cultures and professions of science and technology, war and intelligence. This dramatically different line of cultural/technological evolution in the media for creating, recording and disseminating knowledge is one critical factor in the displacement of the humanities as the exemplary knowledge of modern and now postmodern societies, and of print information and communications technologies (print ICTs) as the normative medium for knowledge work.. We have never spoken of print humanities; to invent the term digital humanities is to recognize a rupture and to acknowledge the belated engagement of the humanities as a field of learning (as distinct from individual humanities scholars) with this transformational shift in the methods and modes of knowledge creation, transmission, and conservation. A recent exploration of the rapidly evolving scope and characteristics of humanities work in the digital environment is Burdick et al’s <i>Digital_humanities</i> (2012). By using a symbol derived specifically from digital discourse, the underscore, to connect the two terms, the authors directly point to the need to bridge the gap between the two words and the domains they represent.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The advent of digital ICTs and their role as transmitters of non-genetic information between human agents and across time and space focuses unequivocally the role and scope of the new humanities. Just as digital ICTs link extraordinary diversity – of languages, peoples, histories, institutions, from the most global to the most local – so must a new humanities perceive its scope and purpose in these terms. The advent of born digital texts draws attention to the conventional segregation of enquiry in modern humanities (and social sciences) based on the evolution of different kinds of media – art, theatre, literature, music, news, photography, film, television – by offering a new kind of semiotic object composed from any combination of these media forms and therefore generating the need for new kinds of critical and interpretive theory and practice. But recognizing this need is a characteristic of postmodernity at large, the digital humanities being one manifestation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The I-space is especially valuable for conceptualising and understanding the new kinds of professional, organisational and institutional forms and relationships which are evolving in relation to digital ICTs. In the humanities the knowledge creating dynamics of the I-space are evident in</p>

<p class="noindent1">One area of instability of particular importance is apparent in the rhetoric associated with the promotion of digital humanities, where the term empirical is used to emphasise a kinship with the research practices of the technosciences in advanced computing. Burdick et al describe the tension between quantitative methods and qualitative analyses as possibly productive of a generative synthesis, but emphasise that “at stake is the humanities’ unique commitment to wrestle with uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity; to model incommensurate temporalities and ontologies; to explore not just geographies but psychogeographies and the dark recesses of the self; to attend to the non-repeatable and nonstandard phenomena” (2012: 108). Another is the shift from “closed- to open-source cultural production. Open-source culture possesses a multitude of facets and definitions: […] collaborative authoring, multiple versioning, flexible attitudes towards intellectual property, peer contributions, access to multiple communities, and overall patterns of distributed knowledge production, review and use” (77), aspects of which I have raised above in 3.3.6 Commons of the mind.</p>
<p class="noindent1">By being capable of representing, composing with and analysing, and communicating all kinds of discourse in a diversity of media forms and languages, from the most abbreviated (a text message, an advertisement) to the most complex (scientific data, mathematical and philosophical enquiry, virtual worlds, historical and fictional narrative in print, film and television, performance art), networked computing remediates the whole history of media evolution and knowledge creation. It therefore massively enlarges the territory in which the edifice of the humanities has been built. Undoubtedly, once the newness of the new technologies has faded, as with print, the descriptor “digital” will disappear. But, for now, it marks a complex and many-aspected difference introduced into the work of the humanities and the modern conception of what it means to be a professional in the humanities. One fundamentally important factor is the way in which a scholarly digital document, found through a web search, may address a much wider readership than a traditional scholarly edition in print. The loss of monumentality associated with scholarly editions is replaced by a potentially more eclectic range of readings in many different cultural locations.<sup><a id="note81" href="#note_81">81</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s2.23"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-23">5. A New Humanities in the University To-Come</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Just as the university is the proper site of the most rigorous and systematic/methodological application of intellect to the understanding of the given world, so it is the proper site of the most rigorous and systematic/methodological application of intellect to the understanding of the cultural worlds invented by humanity. Granted this fundamental division in the objects of enquiry, it is not possible simply to allocate the first to the sciences, and the second to the humanities. But, by granting equality to both modes of enquiry and knowledge creation, the whole of reality enters the mind of the university as it is constituted <u>outside</u> the university by the interaction of culture with the given world through the medium of language (but also other media) and collective human action. Derrida (2005: 24) makes this point in a way which opens on to a critical factor in a conception of creativity in knowledge work in the humanities when he writes that “The limit of the impossible, the ‘perhaps,’ and the ‘if,’ this is the place where the university is exposed to reality, to the forces from without (be they cultural, ideological, political, economic, or other). It is there that the university is in the world that it is attempting to think.” This limit or border zone has a double aspect, since it represents both the ambiguous area at the limit to thought marked out by each discipline and the excess in the object of enquiry which is not encompassed by the theories, rules, methods and conventions governing knowledge work in specific institutional settings like modern universities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">From this perspective, the field of the academic humanities ceases to be a marginal domain and historically evolved array of disciplines within the Western print-based system of knowledge, the residue of its pre-scientific form. It can instead be understood as constituted by a distinctive mode of cognition and knowledge creation appropriate to the heterogeneous nature of textuality and pursued through the analysis and interpretation of the global contents of the informational world, the semiosphere. A new humanities which is anticipated in the various meanings of “digital humanities” and in the textual diversity of the Web, formally and in association with the cultural institutions responsible for maintaining humanity’s collective memory, must embrace the textual sphere of global cultural production as its defining scope. Furthermore, the movement of peoples, their cultures and languages from their lands of origin to other places creates local mixes of this global heterogeneity. The multiplicity of cultural forms, languages and media in themselves and as remediated by networked computing must become normative for its theory of knowledge work, and the always yet-to-be answered question, What does it mean to be human?, must define the horizon of its enquiries.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But for the university to locate itself fully in the semiotic space of culture it must widen its scope and restrain the social forces internal and external to it which would seek to control and delimit its engagements within the I-space as it is constituted at any given moment of time in any society. It must recognise that human development is a cultural process enabled by fiction in the imaginative creation of possible worlds and by memory in the re-interpretation of inherited knowledge in new cultural settings. It must repay public and personal investment by rendering its knowledge work publicly accessible and by defining the ground on which knowledge policies are formed and knowledge politics are played out. It must understand itself before claiming to understand the worlds we live in.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In order for modern science to exist, the rigorous suppression of all but the denotative capabilities of language has been undertaken. This in itself is not the problem. It lies instead in the hegemonic claim based on that suppression, that only scientific method is capable of generating true knowledge, and in the formation of the science-technology-business nexus which has brought about a drastically narrowed use of the terms creativity and innovation, confusing discovery with creativity and invention, and new product development with innovation. As Foucault, for example, has shown with force and clarity, knowledge creation is a textual and an institutional practice, and dominant institutions and discourses substantially determine what kinds of knowledge are valued in particular societies at particular times. It is only when all that modern science must exclude in human knowledge formation in order to understand the given or natural world exactly is brought back into the discussion that a fuller conception of creativity and innovation can be recovered, and a conception of the postmodern university informed by a new humanities can be articulated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">How could the postmodern university define itself in relation to a democratic imperative which links a free society and creativity to openly accessible resources or an economy of the gift, and which grants equal status to fiction and its interpretation as a source of knowledge? How could the postmodern democratic state formulate policies for knowledge which would support such a self-definition? Currently the commons, indigenous knowledge and fiction do not figure centrally in Western universities’ self-concepts, or in public policies for knowledge. But everything about the activity associated with creativity and innovation emphasises a discontinuity or rupture with the known, the customary, the repeated in knowledge and experience, in any domain of culture and society. When Derrida relates deconstruction to “the question of […]”, or thinks of an institution or a quality of society (the university or democracy) in the aspect of the to-come, he is inviting engagement in creative, innovative mental work which will give expression to that which is as yet potential and of the future within a culture’s resources of knowledge. His call for a new humanities is a call to forge a humanities to-come which is capable of performing knowledge work according to these principles.<sup><a id="note82" href="#note_82">82</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Conceiving of the position of the postmodern university in the social process of knowledge creation and exchange from a perspective in indigenous knowledge complements arguments based on a commons of the mind, since both place knowledge creation and exchange in the framework of the gift economy. Kuokannen’s argument that equality in the relation between Western and indigenous knowledges in the postmodern university can be attained only if the latter are able to participate equally in the work of the university through the “convergence of different epistemes” in a process of “conceptual transformation and ongoing epistemic engagement” (2007: 120) applies as well to the relations between the new humanities, the creative arts and the sciences just as much as to the relations between formal, informal and tacit knowledges, the relations between bureaucratic, commercial and academic knowledges, or the relations between cultures and their inherited knowledges. The postmodern university as a public institution must be open to and permeated by the diversity of ways of knowing which constitute the complex society in which it is located, a locus of and focus for the intellectual and cultural energies animating social action towards enabling the coming into being of a society’s best future. Inevitably, since all conceptions of the future are politicised conceptions, such an institution will be a site for the engagement and negotiation of politicised thinking. This engagement would be premised, as Haiven argues (2014: 151), on a belief that knowledge work is a common pursuit characterized by commitment to and participation in reciprocal responsibilities. The concept of the gift and the concept of the commons anchor a theory and practice of knowledge relations governed by an ethic of mutual responsibility in which the asymmetry of cultures, languages, human purposes and values is the most important defining characteristic; they also anchor a theory of knowledge institutions which is grounded in discursive equality, not in the hegemony of one part of knowledge over all its other parts.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Understanding a society and its cultures, and positing its possible futures, is based on the diversity of texts which represent and record its collective effort over time at self-comprehension. Nation-states which are not imperial nations will depend largely upon their own citizens for the writing of their history and imagining the nation to-come, the analysis of the distinctive evolution of their languages in all of the unique environments in which human cultures evolve, the creation of their arts and their mass media systems, the conversations about themselves which pass through local media, public and political discourse, education, religion, and so on. Each human mind is like a star in the night sky, radiating its light without knowing who sees it, or where and when it might be seen.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The humanities cannot become a truth-generating knowledge system in competition with the technoscience system. It cannot erase, but must instead foreground, the specifics of context in which the work of postmodern humanists is carried out. The specifics include plural local and national contexts of the work - languages, histories, cultures, knowledge systems, politics, economies – and a conception of its public role and accountability, affirmed by its participation in an on-going, open and democratic conversation about the values on which human societies are founded and shape their futures. The enormous power humanity has acquired by advances in technoscientific knowledge to shape human and natural evolution must be balanced by a culturally and ecologically sensitive learning process with its roots in collective memory and inherited knowledge. Reading and writing humanistically is now to read and write from a position in time, space and value, but oriented towards the future and essaying what it is possible to think. A new humanities is imagined in the vision of law advanced by Sarat et al when they refer to law as “a moral achievement that emerges from rich traditions of rhetoric, textual interpretation, and ethical and philosophical argument, and institutional practice – traditions that are at the heart of humanistic inquiry” (2010: 44). It is also imagined by Bonneuil and Fressoz in their analysis of the transformations in thinking and action required by the period of the Anthropocene, where they foresee an environmental humanities integrating society and environment “in a dialogue with the sciences of nature” (2016: 33).</p>
<p class="noindent1">What is an available model for the kind of mental work which I am arguing is to be performed by a new humanities, and can give a name to the postmodern university? To estrange the future as much as possible, and to reorient the university from the ground of a new humanities as the coordinates of this domain of advanced enquiry have been sketched in this chapter, my proposal, which will be justified in <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a>, is to conceptualise the postmodern university as the Poetic University.<sup><a id="note83" href="#note_83">83</a></sup> Such a university, which would seek to place creativity and innovation in thinking at its foundations, must not only admit an equal claim to new knowledge creation from the humanities; it must grant that singular thought, founded axiomatically, theorised and informed by immersion in some aspect of humanity’s collective knowledge, can generate new possible truths. Implicit in the terms creativity and innovation, as terms for poetic thought exploratory of the resources and boundaries of the semiosphere, there are also Derrida’s phrase “without condition”, the term “fiction”, and the “to-come” of humanity and of democracy.</p>

He introduces an important caveat to the concept in commenting that “how the inner connections among the diverse – but probably all necessary – knowledge-producing systems in our culture could complement our search for understanding and control [needs to be understood, but] in a way that does not reduce those systems to one foundational knowledge type” (143).</p>

To go back to the origin, Montaigne’s Essais. Sarah Bakewell’s study of the book is both a fine instance of humanistic reading and writing and a sensitive appreciation of the power and attraction of Montaigne’s writing. She describes the book as “a centuries-long conversation between Montaigne and all those who have got to know him: a conversation which changes through history.” She refers to a contenporary source for a metaphor for the essay as Montaigne creates it: “To essay something is to test or taste it, to give it a whirl. One seventeeth century Montaignist defined it as firing a pistol to see if it shoots straight, or trying out a horse to see if it handles well.” She quotes Montaigne observing self-reflectively: “If my mind could gain a firm footing, I would not make essays. I would make decisions; but it is always in apprenticeship and in trial” (2011; 9, 8, 16). For a fine contemporary example of the essay in humanistic knowledge work using the blog form, see Giovanni Tiso.<a href="https://bat-bean-beam.blogspot.com/">https://bat-bean-beam.blogspot.com/</a>. “This is a golden age for the essay” is the title of an interview with Rebecca Solnit published in The Guardian Weekly (Cooke, 2017: 37).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_29" href="#note29">29</a></sup> See Ross (2000), for a comparison between performing artists and academics, “whose labor has been degraded and deprofessionalized in recent years. […] artistic and academic traditions extol sacrificial concepts of mental or cultural labor that are increasingly vital to newly important sectors of the knowledge industries. No longer on the margins of society, in Bohemia or the Ivory Tower, they are providing a rationale for the latest model of labor exploitation in core sectors of the new industrial order, and pioneering the workplace of tomorrow” (2).</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_36" href="#note36">36</a></sup> This issue is highighted by Fuller (2011: 3), who sees his work as “engaged in redefining the foundations of the social sciences in the face of a pincer attack from biology and theology.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_37" href="#note37">37</a></sup> Gross (2010, 418) states that Maurice Halbwachs coined the term collective memory “to emphasize the way even individual memories are formed socially, through families, religious communities, and even social classes. Most scholars who have taken Halbwach’s conception as a starting point define collective memories as ‘collectively shared representations of the past.’ The social science of collective memory and cultural trauma shows the centrality of collective memory to the reproduction of society and the formation of identity.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_38" href="#note38">38</a></sup> A powerful theorisation of this tripartite formation is Soja’s conception of Thirdspace, which he defines as “a limitless composition of of lifeworlds that are radically open and openly radicalizable; that are inclusive and transdisciplinary in scope yet politically focused and susceptible to strategic choice; that are never completely knowable but whose knowledge nonetheless guides our search for emancipatory change and freedom from domination. Trilectical thinking is difficult, for it challenges all conventional modes of thought and taken-for-granted epistemologies. It is disorderly, unruly, constantly evolving, unfixed, never presentable in permanent constructions” (1996: 79). Spatiality, historicity and sociality are the key coordinates for this way of thinking, the exemplary site for which is the “real-and imagined” form of the city. Soja’s analysis, while of great significance for my argument, does not consider the humanities as a distinctive mode of knowledge formation, a further incentive to my focus on the semiosphere. Trilectical thinking is clearly integral to my case for a new humanities.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_39" href="#note39">39</a></sup> Edquist affirms that, while the objectives of innovation policy “have normally been economic ones - like economic growth, productivity growth, increased employment and competitiveness [- it] can also have non-economic objectives, such as social, military or environmental ones. There may be conflicts between the objectives when several are being pursued at the same time.[…] These objectives are, of course, determined in a political process” (2001: 47). Furthermore, “Systems of innovation can be quite different from each other, e.g. with regard to specialisation of production, resources spent on R&amp;D, etc. […] Institutions such as laws, norms, and values also differ considerably between national systems” (55). See Edquist and Hommen (2008) for a large-scale enquiry into the significance of national differences. A contrasting position is taken by Jon Sundbo, whose analysis of innovation is “restricted to innovations in the formal economy. One could argue that innovations outside the formal economy, for example in the leisure sphere or the informal social system, can be of great importance to our lives. […] But the point of departure for this analysis is economic development and the forms of behaviour which lie behind it. It would be beyond the scope of this analysis to consider these other processes of cultural change. They may well be of importance to the innovation processes in the longer view but they have no current importance for the innovation process in existing companies” (1998: 20).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_40" href="#note40">40</a></sup> Bernstein (2011: 69) writes that “A constellation is an alternative model for understanding what is often characterized as fragmentation, parataxis, isolation, insularity, atomization, and separate development. Hypertextulity maps a syncretic space that articulates points of contact and that potentiates both spatial connections among discrepant parts and temporal overlays that merge or melt into one another.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_41" href="#note41">41</a></sup> Boisot, MacMillan and Han (2007) further develops and applies the concept of the I-space, and includes an essay by Boisot which raises challenging questions about the relation between knowledge flows, the effect of ICTs, and the future of state and corporate bureaucracies.</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_43" href="#note43">43</a></sup> Stehr (2005) argues that the pace and extent of new knowledge creation in the techno-sciences is challenging existing conceptions of regulation, and that a new form of politics – knowledge politics – is developing: “The essence of knowledge politics consists of strategic efforts to move new scientific and technical knowledge, and thereby the future, into the center of the cultural, economic, and political matrix of society. [...] The worry that our conduct persistently lags behind the developmnt of knowledge has been replaced by concerns about the accumulation of novel knowledge that appears to have questionable social and cultural consequences” (6, 8).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_44" href="#note44">44</a></sup> Bod (2013: 362) with more restraint refers to the “multicoloured palette” of the humanities.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_45" href="#note45">45</a></sup> In the form of “universally distributed intelligence”, this democratic conception of fundamental human capabilities is a key factor in Levy’s (1997) development of the concept of collective intelligence. He writes that “While we are increaingly concerned with economic and ecological waste, it seems as if we are willing to squander our mot precious resourceby refusing to acknowledge it, develop it, or even use it where it is found. From a school report to a corporate job profile, from archaic management methods to social exclusion through unemployment, we are currently witnessing the deliberate organization of ignorance concerning the extent of intelligence around us, a terrifying waste of experience, skill, and human wealth” (14-15).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_46" href="#note46">46</a></sup> The final version of this policy statement (Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment 2015) retains a modified version of the section “Continued Focus on Vision Matauranga” and adds a new paragraph: “Given the increasingly prominent role Māori organisations are playing in the primary industries and other commercial sectors, we can also consider opportunities to work with these organisations to determine how appropriate research at the interface between Māori knowledge and R&amp;D can contribute to growing our economy in an environmentally sustainable manner” (61). ”Research” here clearly means modern Western scientific research.</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_56" href="#note56">56</a></sup> See Te Mana Taumaru Matauranga, Introduction: “the rights that indigenous people often assert may be collective, rather than individual, in nature with traditional knowledge and traditional knowledge-based innovations and practices possibly being developed incrementally over several generations.” The view expressed in this report, that “There needs to be a careful balance between the protection of those who own IP rights and the wider need for society to encourage creativity, innovation and growth” (5), does not seem to have made much of an impression on the government, as negotiations like the Trans-Pacific Partnership Treaty demonstrate. But it is fully endorsed in a valuable study by Drahos and Frankl (2102). Although it is not part of the authors’ intentions, Section 5 of their chapter in particular can be read against the humanities, beginning with the opening sentence, “Indigenous innovation is place-based innovation” (13).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_57" href="#note57">57</a></sup> Waitangi Tribunal (2011). Ko Aotearoa Tenēi demonstrates the international scope of challenges to Western conceptions of intellectual and cultural property by indigenous peoples, the necessity of negotiation between the different cultural systems, laws and conventions, and the cultural specificity of the knowledge and practices of a particular people. Geismar (2013) offers an excellent discussion of its significance.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_58" href="#note58">58</a></sup> The Waitangi Tribunal offers this account: “The public domain is generally defined as encompassing that vast body of information, knowledge, and creative or inventive works that has never been or is no longer protected by IP rights. It is freely available for the public to use as they wish. It is the flipside of the private rights created in the system of IP law, and its existence is essential to the proper functioning of that system. None of this is expressed in New Zealand law. Rather, it is implied in the statutory limits and exceptions to the private rights those Acts create” (2011: Vol 1, 63).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_59" href="#note59">59</a></sup> OECD (2007, 15) proposes that “Openness means access on equal terms for the international research community at the lowest possible cost, preferably at no more than the marginal cost of dissemination. Open access to research data from public funding should be easy, timely, user-friendly and preferably Internet-based.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_60" href="#note60">60</a></sup> Bod’s approach to linguistic diversity is carefully documented. He explains that he was able to read sources in English and 6 European languages, and that he read sources originally written in other languages where they had been translated into the languages familiar to him. In the latter case, he also consulted experts on the quality of the translations of those texts (2013: 10-11).</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_64" href="#note64">64</a></sup> Lotman (1990: 47) defines a text as “an isolated, self-contained semiotic function, with its integral indivisible meaning and its integral indivisible function.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_65" href="#note65">65</a></sup> A complex analysis of what is at stake in a medium shift is provided by Gaggi (1997). See also Tomlinson (1999, Ch.5, “Mediated Communication and Cultural Experience”): “The means of communication are never transparent but always intrinsically shape the communication” (155).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_66" href="#note66">66</a></sup> Badiou (1998: 18-19; Edmond (2012) is written from a local example and rethinks comparative literature from a multi-lingual perspective in globalisation. Edmond’s study, A Common Strangeness, of late-twentieth century intersections among poets with different linguistic and cultural origins is possible because of the linguistic fluency of its author. See in particular his discussion of Yang Lian, living in exile in Auckland, and the issue of the translation into English of Bei Dao’s poetry.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_67" href="#note67">67</a></sup> A provocative exploration of this point is William Gibson’s and Bruce Sterling’s novel, The Difference Engine (1990).

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_68" href="#note68">68</a></sup> Twenty years on, while this statement remains important in contexts of open communication, the development of algorithms tailoring news to individual preferences is a powerful counter-use of networked communication systems.</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_71" href="#note71">71</a></sup> His bibliographical theorising in practice is exemplified in his Treaty paper, McKenzie (1985), his Panizzi lectures, McKenzie (1986), and in the establishment of Wai te ata Press, a project now carried on by Dr Sydney Shep and a local site of developments in digital humanities.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_72" href="#note72">72</a></sup> Money has followed the same arc as other kinds of semiotic object, from physical inscription on metal or other kinds of material substrate to paper to computer screen. It is the lowest common denominator of writing, since it is provides the most reductive form of equivalence between unlike things, homogenising difference through a process of translation based on numerical signs.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_73" href="#note73">73</a></sup> Mark Bernstein (2009), Eastgate Systems’ chief scientist, identified in personal terms in his essay “Into the Weeds” the complexities attendant on moving from a traditional print to a hypertextual mode of reading and writing. The essay is presented as numbered paragraphs (lexias) with possible reading paths identified by selected paragraph numbers grouped at the end of each paragraph in addition to the linear sequencing required by the form of the print book.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_74" href="#note74">74</a></sup> See Drucker (2011: 16-19) on the importance of a theory of the interface in humanities scholarship. Other valuable considerations of this issue can be found in Liu (2004: 158-173), who argues that the user-friendly Graphical User Interface both gives effect to and symbolizes “corporate culture as the generalized interface of culture”; Ulmer (1994: 28-31) enquires into the question of a rhetoric appropriate to the new writing made possible by hypermedia and sees interface design as giving form to such a rhetoric because the role of the interface, as of rhetoric, is to faciltate communication. He sees book and office metaphors - the desktop – as a limited beginning, with filmaking providng a more complete metaphor for writing in hypermedia (145).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_75" href="#note75">75</a></sup> A valuable demonstration of the interrelationship between textual and software evolution is provided by David Ciccoricco in his discussion of Joyce’s hypertext fiction, Twilight, a Symphony (2009: 176-179). For a discussion of the evolution of the novel as a genre through the shift from print to digital media, see Payam (2014).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_76" href="#note76">76</a></sup> The source of this aphorism was, as best as I can recollect, a publication of the Bay Area Writing Project in the late 1970s. But its likely context is the work of Walter J. Ong, for example, Ong (1977: 42, 46): “Since writing came into existence, the evolution of the word and the evolution of consciousness have been intimtely tied in with technologies and technological developments. Indeed, all major advances in consciousness depend on technological transformations and implementations of the word. [...] Writing and print and the computer enable the mind to constitute wirthin itself - not just on the inscribed surface or on the computer programs – new ways of thinking, previously inconceivable questions, and new ways of searching for responses.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_77" href="#note77">77</a></sup> Elizabeth Eisenstein’s <i>The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</i> (1979) is generally regarded as the inaugural text in this field, which led to many national histories of the book and/or print culture as the extraordinarily rapid shift to digital information and communications technologies got under way in the later decades of the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_78" href="#note78">78</a></sup> See, for example, Ulmer (1994), who affirms that “Writing as technology is a memory machine, with each apparatus finding different means to collect, store, and retrieve information” (16). Ulmer is a theorist of the cognitive technology shift from print to electronic technologies and its implications for cultural invention, and he is specifically interested in “the new possibilities of thought manifested in electronic technology” (17). His book as a whole enacts a “generative experiment. Based on a given theory, how might another text be composed?” (5); it is based on the principle that “[not] just one politics or aesthetics or pedagogy [is] available in a theory but many, depending on who is doing the inventing and within the practices of what institution” (5).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_79" href="#note79">79</a></sup> McGann (2001: 199) writes that “A page of printed or scripted text should thus be understood as a certain kind of graphic interface. […] a broad heuristic distinction separates informational from imaginative texts. The former aspire to transparency, the latter to noise, redundancy, repetition. One is vehicular, the other, iconic.”</p>
