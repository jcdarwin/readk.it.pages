<p class="noindent1">‘those unwritt’n, or at least unconstraining laws of vertuous education, religious and civill nurture […] the bonds and ligaments of the Commonwealth, the pillars and sustainers of every writt’n Statute’ ((Milton, 1644/1974: 219)</p>
<p class="noindent1">We humans live within complex networks of exchange and transmission, which include many kinds of economy and forms of society. If Western governments currently understand these networks from within an economic frame of reference, with the effect that “society exists to serve our economy”; understanding them from the perspective of the humanities is based on the opposing position, that “our economy exists to serve our society.” While humanities knowledge has economic effects and value (even if uncounted), its proper role is to maintain, refresh and re-think a society’s founding principles, beliefs, laws, customs and values, the position affirmed by Milton when he places culture at the foundations of the formal ordering and regulation of society and economy. This placing of knowledge identifies what has to change for humanities knowledge to be perceived as relevant to democratic governments and societies in the twenty-first century. This chapter and the next will propose that a postmodern state operating on a democratic premise must give priority to functions, structures and institutions which sustain the cultural foundations of democratic participation, life-long learning and creative practice, and which provide public access to means of understanding the complexities of social, economic and cultural evolution. Rethinking the positioning of cultural, media and educational institutions in government policies for knowledge and innovation, and rethinking the term humanities as inclusive of all knowledge and enquiry related to the question, What does it mean to be human?, or to the idea of humanity, is fundamental to accomplishing a fully human-focussed rather than a reductively economy-focussed democratic society. Such a review would leave no component of these institutional relationships, least of all the modern humanities, unchanged. But the compelling motive would be to entrench a conception of the role and core responsibilities of the state derived from the creative and innovative citizen, not the market, and to open an opportunity for the humanities and the cultural agencies of the state and civil society to assert and redefine their intrinsic value to society, which are currently suppressed by the dominance of business conceptions of value and the conventions of knowledge creation and validation derived from modern science and its technocratic and bureaucratic extensions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The previous chapter sought to locate the parameters according to which a new humanities as an evolving body of expert knowledge would both shape and be shaped by the conditions for creating knowledge in postmodernity, and would contribute to the reconceptualising of the university as a critical component in humanity’s evolved systems for creating and evaluating knowledge. Rather than being thought of as two opposing cultures, the sciences and the humanities were presented as complementary modes of acquiring knowledge, based on the distinctive differences of their objects of study and analysis, and the methods and outcomes of that intellectual work. At the most advanced levels of humanistic enquiry into the meaning of texts, theoretical difficulty is one index of the conceptual complexity required to understand and interpret as fully as possible the real complexity of a culture’s texts. In other words, textual complexity (of the texts studied and the texts produced from that study) is the most complete expression and index of human complexity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Reciprocally, how does this advanced and highly sophisticated textual/intellectual work move and have effects in the world beyond the institutional site of its creation, most typically the university, but also cultural institutions, research centres and the private spaces of the independent scholar/thinker? How should those effects be valued? The humanities lack the shortcut through the economy to estimates of value which is available to scientific and technological knowledge (even though this lack is principally a matter of how contributions to the economy have historically been counted<sup><a id="note_1" href="#note1">1</a></sup>). For knowledge of any kind to have public value it must be disseminated throughout the I-space, and ultimately to individuals wherever they might be located in a specific relation to humanity’s collective knowledge. Expert knowledge participates in social flows of knowledge of all kinds, and is modified and put to unexpected uses in social spaces remote from its origin. But because the fundamental work performed by humanities knowledge is the transformation through learning of singular minds, modes and sites of dissemination are of critical importance. For the former, the expert work of a new humanities must be able to speak in diverse registers, languages and media. A point made by Sarat about the education of lawyers, that it “should include the cultivation of a meaningful appreciation of the law as a rhetorical practice – not just as an art of persuasion, but as a disciplined, textured, self-directed habit of reading, speaking and, above all, writing, that has at its root a critical understanding of the links among language, consciousness, and power” (2010: 4), needs to be extended to all those acquiring advanced knowledge in the humanities. Dissemination from this perspective is not popularisation if thought of as “dumbing down”, but a matter of employing appropriate rhetorics and media channels so that the meaning and value of expert knowledge can be rendered accessible to the diverse publics constituting a democratic society, and can participate in the universal project of enlarging human knowledge as a public project to which all can contribute.<sup><a id="note_2" href="#note2">2</a></sup> Sites of dissemination are the myriad settings where minds educated humanistically are engaged in interpretive work, and where humanistic knowledge informs decision-making and social action. The public sphere (however compromised by corporate control of communications media) is therefore the primary domain of circulation for humanities knowledge, with readers and writers connecting in many different permutations of affiliations, interests, orientations, educational experience, media forms and public involvement. Most experts can only be experts in a small area of knowledge, and otherwise are like any other member of the public, afloat in the I-space.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But, specifically, how can humanists communicate with government, when the discourse of government is technocratic while humanist discourse emphasises principles, histories, singular minds and cultural identities? Treating the problem as rhetorical requires the humanist to know how to interpret and use the objectivist and quantitative conventions for representing knowledge shared by government officials and scientists without being bound by those conventions. Miller and Judice (2002: 3) make the latter point explicit when they set out the terms on which their analysis of cultural policy is undertaken: “Whereas our project is concerned with transforming the social order, the alternative seeks to replicate it – a struggle between cultural policy as transformative versus a functionalist sphere. Our starting points are therefore theory, history and politics, rather than efficiency, effectiveness, and description.” Having to be explicit is in its own way confirmation of the dominant paradigm for cultural policy formation and its exemplification in public sector discourse. Public sector technocratic discourse is itself an acculturated discourse with an embedded value system and modes of subject construction, and its political function is to serve as a means for negotiating with apparent neutrality among competing interests. Of course, understanding what is at stake for public sector workers does not necessarily remove the discursive barrier, since it has two sides.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is instructive to consider a perspective on the manifold difficulties in managing a crossing of domains between academic research and (cultural) policy formation from a position in the social sciences. As Belfiore (2009) argues, even if the discourse conventions are similar, the political dimension remains problematic. Her essay on the topic of bullshit (taken to mean indifference to how things really are and the cultivation of vested interests (343)) locates many aspects of the power relations which largely determine the nature and content of the flows of knowledge from research agencies to government and business, including the way research agendas and outcomes are influenced by government policy and bureaucratic technologies (“the set of rules and regulations that are in force for […] the public sector” (351). Her clear distinction between research and advocacy (“advocacy [is] a fully legitimate enterprise, but one completely distinct and, ideally, separate from genuinely explorative research” (354)), is a corollary of the position that social research can and should be fully distanced from political entanglements, whether disciplinary or governmental, and that it is the different discursive and rhetorical requirements for formulating and disseminating knowledge (at bottom, knowing how to lie) in policy domains which present the core problem. Genuine research is to be identified by language which “describes reality correctly” (349), in contrast, for example, not only to politicised discourse but also to “the intentional obscurity and impenetrability of a certain portion of academic writing” (352). Here the multiple exclusions of the humanities as a source of expert knowledge appear; the humanities discipline which is typically taken to meet the discursive requirement to describe reality correctly is history, but even that is now flawed by conceptual terminologies which, in Belfiore’s account, are not required to penetrate and understand complexity but only serve to mystify. From the perspective of “the rules and regulations” governing thought in the public sector, the humanities can offer only positioned accounts of reality as perceived through the medium of texts and which therefore lack evidential force; they occupy the same semiotic space as culture, outside the current bureaucratic systems for measurement and attribution of value. The issue, then, is not how humanities knowledge can be applied to social purposes, that is, to understanding and advocacy, but what are the conditions required for such applications to be granted the same kind of evidential authority as is knowledge created within a system organised and formalised to “describe reality correctly”, and what kinds of discourse can adequately mediate between research generating knowledge as such and the multiple social settings (including but not limited to the economy) where that knowledge may be of use?</p>
<p class="noindent1">Belfiore offers an answer of a kind to this question in a reference to (for me) a more constructive way of thinking about political speech, that it is “a proactive strategic communication, meant not to hide a truth or reality or to divert from a particular responsibility, but to create or manage an impression” (351). This seems to me an excellent account of the way in which discourses seeking to shape thought in relation to knowledge, values, histories and interests in a politicised society function constructively. It can also be taken as a statement about how an artist communicates, noting that key terms in the statement – proactive, strategic and impression - can together orient a conception of the purpose of communication not towards “truth or reality” directly but towards the new, the future, the “what if” or the “about-to-become”, which are not yet states of reality but in the disposition of which collective and individual thinking play a crucial role.<sup><a id="note_3" href="#note3">3</a></sup> In this way, the arts (and the humanities) are clearly more closely aligned to politics than to the empirical sciences in their relation to reality and truth. That this mode of relation is not valued in the conduct of democratic states says a very great deal about misrecognition in government and the political class about the kinds of work they do with knowledge. It also points to the failure of the modern humanities to formulate an evolving account of the functions of humanistic enquiry among the expanding and diverse kinds of knowledge active in industrial and now post-industrial, democratic societies, and a portfolio of models of effective discursive engagement with diverse audiences and agencies of the state<sup><a id="note_4" href="#note4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have argued in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a> that one of the critical parameters distinguishing humanities from scientific knowledge is its local origin; however much it would aim to address global conditions and issues, it remains marked by the territorial, historical, linguistic and cultural contexts of its production. The local is also the scene of ethnic and religious conflict, war, racism, economic oppression, crime, exploitation of socially powerless men, women and children, the scene of the worst that human beings (especially organised in groups) can do. And it is reproduced in the virtual locals constituted by networked communications systems. There is nothing inherently better or worse about the local in comparison to the national or the global dimensions of the life world. The difference is that developing an account of humanity in postmodernity, and therefore a new humanities which is capable of most completely articulating that account, must begin and end with the singular citizen mind in its knowledgable encounters with the given world, other minds and the social worlds humans have made. It must weave together the most local of times and places, the singular point of origin of each human person, the birth time and place, birth family and mother tongue, and the evolution of singular minds composing themselves from and being composed by the collectively conserved and reproduced systems of cultural knowledge in a life-long process of learning and creative thinking. It will be framed by history and the determining but not absolute power of social institutions, now especially the nation-state in the larger context of international structures of law, finance and telecommunications. I intend this emphasis on the origin and evolution of the singular mind to invert the current emphasis on the economy as the origin of everything human and social, even though it will undoubtedly seem counterintuitive and even simply counterfactual. To think and perceive from the perspective of the humanities is to regard the economy as a subset of the social<sup><a id="note_5" href="#note5">5</a></sup>, everywhere marked by cultural knowledge because every transaction classified as economic is embedded in ideologies, social rules, laws, conventions, institutions and inheritances, the most typical effect of which is, currently, to condemn a large part of the world’s population to poverty so that some can enjoy excessive wealth. The human life world as perceived and experienced outside the reductive and globalised space and time of the international airport, the mall, the techno-scientific research centre and the gated community<sup><a id="note_6" href="#note6">6</a></sup>, is a world circumscribed by the dense specifics of location and history while participating through communications media and the movement of peoples in the differences of elsewhere and the unpredictable imagining and thinking that awareness of elsewhere can generate.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s3.1"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-1">1. Going Back to Go Forward</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The counter claim to the dominance of techno-scientific knowledge in government policy has been made repeatedly by humanist organisations and humanistic thinkers as the technosciences have risen to their dominant position, and one of their branches, economics, has become the official discourse of democratic governments. One version of the counter claim will serve to stand for all. Deryck Schreuder (1995: xii-xiii), then President of the Australian Academy of the Humanities and on the occasion of the Academy’s Silver Jubilee affirmed that, “for all their so-called irrelevance and lack of utility […] the humanities actually provide the possibility of renewing the very well-springs of our open society and culture.” In its context, the Australian Academy of the Humanities’ response to the Federal Government of Australia’s publication of <i>Creative Nation,</i> this claim is part of a succinctly detailed summary of the ways in which humanities knowledge work makes a fundamental contribution to society and government. The Academy, like those in other democratic nations facing the force of the neoliberal storm, has done much to assist its professional cadre to think differently about the value of their knowledge work and its social applications, and to attempt to modify official thinking. But, as the Academy’s symposia indicate, this has so far been a largely unrewarding and unrewarded struggle, as academics have been drawn into research assessment exercises and the criteria for measuring research impact have valued a scientific modality of research and the commercialisation/commodification of knowledge, and the humanities have remained on the margins in public policies for knowledge and innovation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A moment’s recollection. In 1976, the philosopher Stuart Hampshire gave the 22nd Fawley Foundation Lecture, <i>Knowledge and the Future</i>. It is worth noting that this lecture series at the University of Southampton was founded by the Esso Petroleum Company in 1953 on the premise that “the future of this nation and of mankind is closely linked with the relationship between science and industry”. As with H. G. Barnett’s study of innovation discussed in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a>, it is refreshing to be able to stand back from the clamour of present interests and to observe another way of thinking about the relation between knowledge creation and the future of humanity than that focussed on innovation in the context of economic policy-making.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For Hampshire, understanding knowledge and the purposes served by creating it is positioned historically: “after the three hundred years of scientific advance and historical scholarship [self-knowledge and self-understanding] are the condition of the development of the species. We have to plough back accumulated knowledge into the strengthening of intelligence in all its forms, into an assisted evolution of the species” (1976: 16). Knowledge creation is thus not the progressive displacement of the old by the new but the progressive accumulation (a semiosphere in Lotman’s terms) by means of which humanity intervenes intentionally in the course of its own evolution. And <u>all</u> knowledge has potential for this purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One could remark ironically that only some forms of intelligence have been massively strengthened in the 40 years since Hampshire gave this lecture. It is a clear marker of discursive change that he does not use the terms innovation or knowledge society or cultural policy; but he is deeply concerned about the critical role of knowledge in humanity’s ability to chart its future and about what he perceived then as the imbalance or disproportion in public policies towards the sciences over the arts. His concern is not only about the high levels of investment in the sciences in contrast to the arts, but also about the degree of public recognition given to the respective contributions of the sciences and the arts to the ability of humanity to survive the conditions for planetary life which human actions have overwhelmingly brought about, in the name of the modern Western project for the rational management of nature (including human nature) for human betterment through science and technology.</p>
<p class="noindent1">He locates the ultimate origin of new knowledge in the “the perpetual restlessness of the mind, reviewing its own stocks of knowledge, and in the course of this, putting the stocks of knowledge in a new order, which opens up new inquiries. This is the power of invention and discovery, also the power of the imagination” (4). This humanistic emphasis is not an argument for a romantic conception of individual genius, but instead accepts that there is a necessary tension between singularity and institutionality, the unpredictable and the governed, at the heart of modern knowledge creation, which he calls “the principal wound in modern culture” (6). While “new knowledge depends on ideas from different disciplines being connected within a single mind” (15), it is also the case that “of its nature, knowledge advances by the division of labour, by ever-increasing specialisation” (5), a wound already observed in Pynchon’s <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i> (1965/2000: 61) as the “nightmare” of work in the new high-technology research and development firm where the singular, inventive mind is subordinated to corporate plans and project strategies. Supporting Pynchon’s analysis, Hampshire writes that “We cannot plan invention […] In so far as we could plan the work of the imagination, we should not think of it as the imagination; […] talent and genius, whether in the arts or sciences, are both unpredictable and uncontrollable” (6). He does not privilege a type of knowledge, but accepts that the knowledge spectrum represented by the terms science and arts demarcates the space within which the creation of new knowledge can occur. As I have already demonstrated, this is not the basic assumption of innovation policy thinking, even although “the work of the imagination” is now generally claimed under the term “creativity” for the sciences as well as the arts.<sup><a id="note_7" href="#note7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">For a government attempting to find its way to effective policies underpinning the development of an innovative knowledge society in New Zealand, Hampshire sets up a critical issue. There is a sense in which the fundamental terms on which such a knowledge society is to be premised are irrational, embedded in the contingencies of minds, histories and cultures, and human creative and sociable capabilities which are realised most extensively in the means and media of cultural formation and practice. An innovation policy which would seek to answer the question, what should the content of innovative thinking be?, will inevitably fail, for the simple reason that innovative thinking by definition takes a singular mind “beyond the information given” (to use the title of a book of essays by Jerome Bruner (1973) which captured my attention when it was first published), in directions the sources of which may be detectable retrospectively but cannot be prescribed in advance. Much knowledge policy and administrative practice in effect attempts to anticipate the outcomes of thought, especially within disciplinary and institutional contexts; but this is because institutional, disciplinary and governmental objectives are now based on claims that their work in these fields is distinguished by being inherently innovative and because administering investment is manageable when the recipients are organisations rather than individuals. It is notorious that true innovation (making a difference in thought rather than making a different thing) is often unrecognisable to systems designed to manage the production of knowledge either as such, in research, or through the link between policy and the application of public funding. Put another way, outcomes of thought that might have market value are literally and metaphorically the business of the private sector to implement (but also the public sector where the public interest is so great that public funding, and even public management of that funding, can be justified). As I have already noted in discussing the issue of open access to knowledge, if public investment in knowledge returns a profit, then that profit should return to the public.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At its core innovation in knowledge is a direct function of the ability of each mind to work in combinatory and aleatory ways with the resources at its disposal. It is necessary to look beyond the institutional and political ordering of knowledge to the conditions required for minds to be “restless” and for the deliberated and designed evolution of humanity to be chosen rather than imposed. Whether knowledge is tacit, informal, or formal, expressed in practices, semiotic representations, or formally objectified records (databases, text books, disciplines, laws), its application requires imaginative engagement as the primary means of exploring and envisaging its extension from either its abstract formulation or its previous contexts of use.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The steps in the argument of this chapter and the next are focussed by the primary social institutions which provide the sites for the transmission of knowledge between generations and the learning necessary to sustain a democratic and innovative society. I will use “education” as a term locating the common work or function of this broad spectrum of institutions, only some of which are formally charged with educating, and “education state” as the term for a mode of government which derives its primary rationale from this social function. I will use “cultural policy” as the term for the fundamental policy focus of such a state, and argue that a new humanities would provide the integrative framework of knowledge for such policy formation. Instead of the economy, the quality of the city as the most representative collective human creation, and the quality of Parliament as the representative site of public decision-making in a nation-state, would become the litmus tests of the democratic state’s understanding of its responsibility to the public(s) of the nation it is established to govern.<sup><a id="note_8" href="#note8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">I have argued in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a> that current academic divisions of humanities disciplines based on the traditional triad of literature, history, and philosophy, multiplied by national languages and cultures, and crossed by the nineteenth and twentieth centuries’ evolution of media technologies, no longer serve as an adequate representation of either the expert work of the humanities or its social purposes, or how expertise in humanistic knowledge is to be developed. If a new (or re-constituted) humanities is needed in order that humanities knowledge can engage productively in the public interest with the conditions of postmodernity, so is a new (or re-constituted) conception of the state needed in order that this productivity can be recognised and put to collective use and benefit by the agencies of the state. A postmodern knowledge society must give priority to structures and institutions which provide for life-long learning and participatory citizenship. (Re)thinking cultural, media and educational institutions is fundamental to accomplishing a human-focussed rather than an economy-focussed democratic society, in which the distinctive role of democratic government is manifested in the way public policy formation is directed towards open thinking about the possibilities for society to-come and the complex of values underpinning it, and in the means available to citizens to acquire new knowledge and participate in that enquiry into the future through accessible channels of communication and manifold forms of collective action.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s3.2"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-2">2. An education state</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">What kind of a democratic state would be needed to make cultural policy foundational, rather than marginal, to fulfilling its core responsibilities to the people it governs? Recovery of the idea of democratic governance and its more complete implementation depends upon a profound shift in the centre of gravity in nation states now claiming to be democracies, away from the economy and the cluster of interests it brings together and towards educating and learning as the primary focus of public policy. This does not mean that the human interests and needs ideally satisfied by the economy are not of primary concern to most citizens; it does mean that a government responsible for the health and well-being of a whole society needs to ground its policy-making in an integrated conception of the human person in sociable relations with others. Such a conception cannot be unitary or universal, since it must accommodate human diversity in its local and global manifestations, not least the ancient diversity of the life stages of the human being (the “seven ages of man”).<sup><a id="note_9" href="#note9">9</a></sup> There is as profound a disjunction between the long developmental time-frame of the human person and the short policy time-frame of the economy as there is between the institutions focussed on the care of the person in society and those focussed only on economic transactions in a market.<sup><a id="note_10" href="#note10">10</a></sup> The restriction of focus in the latter both concentrates social, political and money power in them and, in so far as institutions which care for society’s dependents (children, the poor, the sick and the aged) have to participate in the economy, imposes the cultural formation of organisations in business and industry (and especially the profit motive) on them.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Formal education is responsible for transmitting the common stock of knowledge as a particular society defines it at a particular time, and is the means by which a society provides, beyond the family, for the core learning and experiences needed for its new generations to carry out personally and collectively the reproduction and adaptive transformation of their society. Because of the mix and diversity of values, belief systems, histories, and moralities in any postmodern society, there is an inevitably political dimension to education, a dimension disguised by the present technocratic approach to curriculum content, policy and administration and the dominant influence of business interests in the name of the economy. Any approach to education which begins with the singular person (initially as a child in their local context of a place and its history and their inheritance of familial values and social positioning) has to incorporate a framework for negotiating diversity that is both collectively agreed and aware of internationally formulated expectations for the conduct of democratic societies. The state is, in this respect, crucially important not only for implementing such expectations to which it accedes on behalf of its citizens, but also for ensuring that they understand the meaning and purpose of these expectations as they are expressed, for example, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Learning about what is known and creating new knowledge, reading and writing in any medium and language, valuing and evaluating, experiencing, deciding and acting are primary characteristics of a humanistic relation to knowledge, which is progressive (if it is) by being recursive, and dependent for its scope on the extent and quality of access to the contents of the semiosphere. Knowledge known like this constitutes common sense as well as academic humanities; it is tested experientially with and against others, and it participates in the governing of society by its members through the myriad of fora, formal and informal groupings, and media systems which sustain discursive variety and facilitate collective action. Humanistic knowledge is the outcome of singular minds engaged in the continuous (re)formulation and critique of norms, mores, laws, inherited and new knowledge and accumulated information, according to cultural, political and academic protocols.</p>
<p class="noindent1">From an economic perspective on policy, culture can be framed as entertainment (the arts, heritage, media content, sport, and tourism), media as technology, and education as a means of disciplining young people to accept the will of the market and those who control access to employment. By contrast, a humanistic perspective sees these three distinct policy domains as together critical in providing the means by which truly self-governing citizens generate the vitality and shape the direction of their society. There is nothing natural about the concept “self-governing citizen”, just as there is nothing natural about the concept “democratic society”. Both are cultural constructs,<sup><a id="note_11" href="#note11">11</a></sup> formed and endlessly revised over time in social action and institutional change. From the perspective of the citizen, de Certeau defines a bottom line in reflecting on the events of May 1968: a democratic society “has to allow everyone to <i>exist</i>, to be different in his or her very relation with others, to be able to create (and to become other than oneself) in a collaboration defined as an inventive process” (1998: 46; author’s emphasis). Reciprocally, for a democratic society to exist and persist, its citizens must be educated to understand their rights and responsibilities, freedoms and duties, as these are both protected and articulated by democratic government through its public sector and parliamentary expressions, and by civil society, the intrinsic value of their cultural inheritances, and the use of information and communications media to engage in the conversation of society about itself, its pasts (actual and might have been), its present and its possible (and impossible) futures.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There are many different fields and flows of discussion and critique which bear upon these matters. One dimension is a complex politics of knowledge; just as the humanities are marginalised in current accounts of the value of knowledge in innovation and the governance of society, so public education is reduced to becoming a neocolonial domain of business and the market<sup><a id="note_12" href="#note12">12</a></sup> with the misconceived principal roles of shaping people of all ages to meet the needs of rapidly and unpredictably changing work places<sup><a id="note_13" href="#note13">13</a></sup> and of competing at the top end of the research-led knowledge economy.<sup><a id="note_14" href="#note14">14</a></sup> In much official thinking, education is not conceived of as a fundamental social and cultural function, complementary to the family as the principal means by which society provides for its continuance and transformation through time and for the fundamental learning of its children and adults over the human life-span, but as fragments reconstituted as a system by their relation to the needs of the economy for labour and materials, the two now convergent in the figure of the knowledge worker.<sup><a id="note_15" href="#note15">15</a></sup> Of course, “the needs of the economy” is a handy abstraction disguising the micro-level control exercised by the private sector over most citizens through access to paid work and therefore to the common means of life in post-industrial societies. A rebalancing of this now most unequal distribution of social power could begin with the introduction of a universal basic income. For all these reasons I will place at the heart of this discussion, not the economy, but the generative power of singular minds, cultures and languages and the human collectivities which create and are sustained by them.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The complexity of the issues linking education to economic development, on the one hand, and what could be called democratic development, on the other, is challenging, especially because neoliberalism, the dominant ideology still shaping conceptions of economy in government and business in democratic societies, is itself now fundamentally challenged both by alternative ways of thinking about society, economy, and humanity’s place in the planet’s ecosystem, and by its obvious failures for the majority of humanity.<sup><a id="note_16" href="#note16">16</a></sup> Nonetheless, neoliberalism’s skeletal model of the state and the citizen continue to be entrenched in social thinking through government policies and legislation, media representation, the dominance of the business and finance sectors of society as political interest groups, and curriculum change in the formal education system (McCarthy, 2011). A striking, local example is the continuing failure of New Zealand governments to include economic, social and cultural rights in the New Zealand Bill of Rights (Opie, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Besley (2008: 4) observes that, in public policy discourse in the late 1990s, “Education is reconfigured as a massively undervalued form of knowledge capital that will determine the future of work, of knowledge institutions, the formulation of education policy and the shape of society in the years to come.” That this reconfiguring is a political much more than an economic issue is implied in the reference to the future “shape of society”, and is made explicit in her affirmation that</p>
<p class="quote">the Left must customise or indigenise the concept of education for social democratic politics. To do this we must return to the history of education rights in the early documents of human rights and renew its ethos as a basis for the new society. […] Above all, we must re-establish education as a minimum welfare right and global public good. (7)</p>
<p class="noindent1">Against the abstract universalism of neoliberal economics, the market and technocratic social management, education is positioned, like citizens of a democracy, as an intersection between local, national and global forms of knowledge and experience, languages and ethnicities, histories and cultures, a social site in which exchanges and negotiations between values, traditions, beliefs, formal and informal knowledge, modes of learning and teaching, public and private purposes and goals, are carried on differently according to the specifics of the place in which educating and learning occur.</p>
<p class="noindent1">While any society will have an economy or economies (legitimate, black, and criminal), an economy does not as a reflex produce a just and humane society based on equality of the right to participate in its governance and equality of the responsibility to advance collective interests.<sup><a id="note_17" href="#note17">17</a></sup> A telling example is provided by William Gibson’s stories of the future imagined from the 1980s, like “New Rose Hotel” (1987: 103-116), in which the state has disappeared, ruthless competition between high-tech corporations and policing by criminal organisations determine the conditions for social life, the elite live segregated from the rest of the population, and human relations are characterised by competitiveness, individualism, and mistrust.<sup><a id="note_18" href="#note18">18</a></sup> As God in the late fifteenth-century morality play <i>Everyman</i> noted when surveying human society, “In worldely riches is all their mind: […] now one wolde by envy another up ete” (Coldewey, 1993: 46), a view which has recently been restated in films like <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i>(2004), <i>Margin Call</i> (2011) and <i>The Big Short</i> (2015).</p>
<p class="noindent1">My argument is that the principal role of the state in a democratic society, the sustaining and advancing of its democratic qualities, can be better articulated from the perspective of education than the economy, in a nation-state or some equivalent territorial unit in which people are connected by histories, cultures and languages which have evolved together in that place over time. Democratic societies are remarkable social innovations, “complex mental ecologies” (Mulgan 1998: 113) realised through collaboration and contest, however imperfectly, in continuously evolving institutions and collective social action and dependent on the quality of their citizens’ education for their ability to make actual the ideals and principles on which they are founded.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s3.3"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-3">3. Becoming an education state</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">What if education rather than the economy or security provided the fundamental rationale of democratic government? What if the state were to become an education state at its core, in which educational rather than economic development were its primary function?</p>
<p class="noindent1">The concept of the education state has been advanced by Olssen, Codd and O’Neill in a wide-ranging study, <i>Education Policy: Globalization, Citizenship and Democracy</i> which was intended to critique the dominance of neoliberal economic theory in public policy and legislation and to reaffirm the fundamental importance of universal public education in the sustaining of a democratic society in a globalising world order. The study adopts “a democratic model which, while it would seek to preserve and protect the important principles of liberal constitutionalism, locates these within a communitarian context, where they are allied to a concept of social inclusion and trust. Only such a model […] can support a conception of education as a public good. In its turn, education […] is seen as pivotal to the construction of a democratic society, and for the model of citizenship that such a conception implies” (Olssen et al. 2004: 15). Key components of the model of democratic and multicultural citizenship are interdependence, collective action based on reflective thought, mutual equal respect and open deliberation at local, regional, national, and global levels, and the existence of channels, mediums and forums facilitating discussion and conflict resolution. They argue that what “legitimizes the state’s authority is its own subjection to the democratic principles that empower it to act”, and that without “norms of trust and responsibility […] markets cannot prosper and democracy cannot survive” (275).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Reconceptualising the democratic state as an education state is necessary if democratic principles are to be taken as the fundamental directive of government policy in democratic societies. For a society to be democratic, all of its citizens must be knowledgable in democratic principles and active in their practice, qualities which are only acquired by education and experience. The formal curriculum must ensure that all citizens-to-be learn enough to know how to operate society’s political, financial, economic and legal systems, and to assess expert opinion<sup><a id="note_19" href="#note19">19</a></sup>. A state which does not ensure that all of its citizens have equal access to the opportunity to acquire these qualities, and to exercise them, has failed in its most fundamental responsibility. The social settings in which these learning opportunities are made available are communal, including all the sites of formal education, but they are most fully represented in the diversity of institutions and forms of social interaction provided by the city.<sup><a id="note_20" href="#note20">20</a></sup> “Citizen” is a more expansive identity than “consumer” or “client” (Alford, 2011: 145), or “worker”,<sup><a id="note_21" href="#note21">21</a></sup> conferring the right and the responsibility to participate in the whole spectrum of activities and processes which enable a complex society to evolve, adapt to circumstance, and assist all its members to accomplish their goals (for themselves and for the society of which they are members) according to their cultural inheritance and in negotiation with others.<sup><a id="note_22" href="#note22">22</a></sup> For Cara, Landry and Lawson (1998: 33-35), “The learning city is a complex creation. It strives to develop new networks of co-operative working that will secure the place of learning at the centre of social and economic regeneration. [… Cities] are learning that only a more active democracy which enables citizens to make and remake the communities in which they live and work can sustain their future.”<sup><a id="note_23" href="#note23">23</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">How do citizens come to understand how to live humanely in a complex, postmodern society? If the family is the primary social institution for inducting new generations into society, it is clearly unable by itself to do more than initiate this process. That it matters so much is clear from the attempts to discipline families which, like failed states, are unable to fulfil the increasingly burdensome expectations of governments which are at the same time withdrawing from taking responsibility for social failure, even when that failure is a consequence of social histories of inequality perpetuated or intensified by laws and government actions which are beyond the ability of families (and now many states) to alter.</p>
<p class="noindent1">What do citizens in a postmodern, globalising democracy need to know – about themselves, the economic and political forces shaping their society, their rights and responsibilities as citizens, the shape(s) of the future available to thought and action - in order to realise the possibilities open (and closed) to them for humane living? To what extent can governments be expected to care at all about the circumstances of the singular citizen when, despite the premises on which democratic societies are ordered, it is those who can aggregate power (and especially money power) across nation state borders to whom democratic governments are currently most responsive? My argument throughout this book is that, from the perspective of the humanities, it is the situation of the singular and sovereign citizen (but perhaps especially the citizen who is also socially classified as a criminal) who provides the test of the democratic qualities of a particular society. And, high on the audit list is the education system as the primary source of knowledge and understanding about how to live humanely in the world as it is and as it could and should be. An education state is one committed to ensuring that its citizens have access to the knowledge they need to live well as citizens, knowledge which can only be acquired progressively as children become adults and assume adult responsibilities and roles. Such knowledge is finally an account for that time and in that society of what it means to be human; it cannot be provided or acquired only through a formally constituted curriculum (although some agreement on knowledge all must have is needed in the public or formal education system), because all kinds of experiences and relationships contribute to each person’s understanding of themselves and their world. But the state must take responsibility for ensuring that there is open access to knowledge about all aspects of the functioning of society, including its history (cultural, social, political, economic), its laws, its institutions, its media, how it is governed, its military and police functions, how its wealth is managed and distributed, how it changes over time and the role of citizens in this process of adaptation and innovation. Its citizens are the fundamental resource of a democratic state, not to be exploited for profit but through understanding to contribute in singular and collaborative ways to advancing the interests of society as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Democratic societies are formally based on the claim to sovereignty by each citizen and on the citizen’s grant of the right to violence to the state in return for protection from violence by others – individuals or groups in the same society, or other states. But, as has been often observed, the state can use this grant of power to confer benefits and make laws which are against the greater public interest.<sup><a id="note_24" href="#note24">24</a></sup> The (failed) war on drugs and the now vastly over-developed military, surveillance and penal apparatus maintained by democratic societies and justified by it are currently compelling examples of the failure of the short cut to solving complex social, political and economic problems which law-making and police systems have come to represent.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I am not so simple minded as to think that the myriad forms assumed by inequality and evil can ever be finally abolished. As Milton wrote, “Good and evill we know in the field of this World grow up together almost inseparably, and the knowledge of good is so involv’d and interwoven with the knowledge of evill, and in so many resemblances hardly to be discern’d” (1644/1974: 212). But a fundamental purpose of an education state must be to use its powers to create the conditions in which as much equality, and as much good, as is possible at a particular point in a society’s democratic evolution can be realised. When the law-making function of government supersedes its educational function, when the belief becomes dominant in Parliament that all that is needed to bring about social change is to pass laws to meet the requirements of powerful groups within society, the disciplinary aspect of the state’s responsibilities and powers becomes increasingly dominant, distorted and compromised. Social order depends upon the perception of equality under the law. When the dependence of the state on an agreement with its citizens that the duty to pay tax is reciprocal with the duty to ensure access to universal public services is forgotten, the ability of the state to maintain the assent of its citizens to its decisions declines and the bonds between citizens and state which make democratic government possible, represented most directly by the rule of law, become increasingly fragile. The quality of the lives of citizens depends largely on the fair management and provision of collective public goods, which citizens alone cannot provide for themselves and among which social order sustained by law is fundamental.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is worthwhile keeping in mind a comment by St Paul that “where there is no law, there is no transgression” (Romans 4.15). In the rush to make laws, especially laws undoing the legislation of a previous government and laws favouring a (powerful) segment of society, the political class threatens belief in the rule of law as the foundation for democratic social order. And, as Milton observed (in the epigraph to this chapter), the law can be effective only if it operates in a context of informed consent and self-discipline, which is acquired through education and experience. Consent becomes replaced by policing and coercion when the operation of the law is neither fair nor just, and when it is perceived to lack those qualities by the diverse publics which make up a postmodern democracy. Only an education state is capable of thinking insightfully through the issues raised by the problematic of social discipline in ways which foreground knowledge marked by culture and the singularity of each citizen; both sources of knowledge are subject to the law and yet exceed its scope, providing a principal source of critique of existing laws and innovation in law-making.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Ultimately the educational and police functions of the state are two sides of the same coin, either complementing and extending the function of the family or disciplining those who fail to meet society’s expectations even when society is the source of the failure. In our present (dis)order, democratic societies have become increasingly punitive and controlling, the powers of the state used for surveillance and remote disciplining of its citizens in a mirror image of the surveillance and disciplining of the consumer by business and finance.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The education state, then, takes education rather than the economy, democratic institutions and citizenship rather than the technoscience-business nexus, learning rather than policing, as the lens through which it views its field of action and values knowledge and learning. Because it governs a postmodern (knowledge) society, the education state concerns itself with much more than the provision of formal education in the policy present. It must think together all public institutions which make it possible for a citizen to acquire knowledge, the social institutions and technological infrastructures of society which facilitate the exchange and sharing of knowledge, the uses of knowledge in society and the economy, and the laws and decision-making processes required for citizens in their cultural and political diversity to participate productively in the governance of their society. The timeframe for policy formation is measured in terms both of responsibility to future generations and of the human life-span, rather than the nano-second timeframe of the financial markets.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Society continues because of the human capacity to educate and be educated throughout a life-time, the exchange and revisioning of knowledge and information of all kinds being the primary condition for social survival and adaptation. The more complex a society becomes, the more complex are its systems for conservation, exchange and review of what it knows collectively, and the more specialised is individual knowledge at the level of expert practice. The knowledge society conceived of in economic/commercial terms is a reductive representation of the I-space of postmodern societies, serving sectional purposes and locating a politics of knowledge at the heart of government. The policy question in the education state would not be, How can education more effectively produce workers and consumers?, but, How can education more effectively assist the growth of citizens of a democratic society in which work and consumption, like family life, health and well-being, access to knowledge and information, and the freedom to participate in that society’s decision-making processes, are closely linked to its core values and their on-going evolution? How do citizens learn to participate deliberately in that evolution, facilitated in an education state through an open and unending public conversation and contest (a core value in itself) over their understanding and application in the context of changing relations within that society and between it and other societies and the natural world?</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is not exaggerating to think of the situation of formal education over the past three decades as one of continual crisis, in which an education system is constrained to fit a model which conforms to the interests of a powerful segment of society but is incapable of accounting for the complex work a formal education system has to do on the behalf of society as a whole. It seems to be generally agreed that the recent period of drastic reform of New Zealand - socially, governmentally, economically – according to neoliberal principles has not produced the economic benefits (at least for the majority of the population) which were the proclaimed purpose of the reforms and were to provide compensation for the stress of structural change. The tensions within the nineteenth century concept of development - in which citizens of a young, recently colonial society are particularly embedded - between a singular focus on the exploitation of colonised territories for wealth and an inclusive conception of moral, social, intellectual and economic improvement (development as civilising) seem to have been currently if insecurely resolved internationally in favour of a singular focus on wealth-creation. Such a resolution, effected by the new imperialism of global financial institutions, places extraordinary pressures upon democratic governments in nations which continue to accept that they have responsibilities towards their citizens and their histories. In Aotearoa New Zealand, I would argue that it is the process, instituted in the mid-1970s, of acceptance by the state of responsibility for the effects of colonisation on the indigenous Māori people and the incorporation into New Zealand’s (unwritten) constitution of the Treaty of Waitangi (signed between the Crown and Māori in 1840) as the founding document of modern Aotearoa New Zealand, which has brought into focus the local complexity of the global situation. Nation-building, one role of the modern democratic state, is, in this respect, a process of local cultural formation and intercultural negotiation, grounded in the specifics of histories and peoples. A perspective grounded in cultural knowledge provides a better conceptualisation of the role of education in an innovative society than does the current, much more limited perspective offered by technoscience, business and the economy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If, as I am arguing, education is first and foremost the social process of transferring between generations non-genetic knowledge and information of fundamental importance to the maintenance and adaptive development of society (of which the economy is but a part), then it is an activity carried out by all social institutions concerned with the conservation, renewal, interpretation and dissemination of society’s stocks of knowledge, and all citizens. While some institutions are privileged at present (those holding and generating intellectual property, for example), a model of a knowledge society which is also an innovative society and not just a profit-generating one must be grounded in a universal conception of knowledge creation and exchange as an intrinsic human activity. Having the ability and the means to communicate something one has thought or learned to someone who has not had that thought can have unpredictable and transformative consequences for the recipient and for society. It is the ground of cultural and social innovation, much broader processes than innovation for the economy but the seed-bed for innovation as product development. As Barnett wrote, the ground of innovation lies in an individual’s cultural inventory, which grows by learning, observation, experience, analysis and reflection, and the mental work carried out both privately and in association with others. Because no-one can predict what might generate transformative thought, a society understanding the importance of new ways of thinking would ensure that access to the sources of thought in inherited and new knowledge were as open as possible – both in the sense of access to repositories and communications media, and of access to competent guides to the breadth and diversity of human knowledge. The richer the diversity of information and encounter, the richer the inventory and the potential for innovation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A useful model of what is at stake here in the education of the citizen is provided by Gardner, who has identified five “minds” necessary for the sustainable evolution of humanity.<sup><a id="note_25" href="#note25">25</a></sup> They locate aspects of the mental formation of the citizen of a democratic state at the same time as they offer a model of what it means to be human:</p>
<p class="nlist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the disciplined mind, which is schooled in basic subjects but also a master of a profession, vocation or craft</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the synthesising mind, which makes sense of disparate and complex information</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the creating mind, which asks new questions and finds imaginative answers</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the respectful mind, which appreciates and engages with different cultures</p>
<p class="nlist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the ethical mind, which enables responsible behaviour as a citizen.</p>
<p class="noindent1">While this list of qualities is admirably humanistic, the “five minds” need to be supplemented by adding two more: the political mind, which crosses this representation of the singular (good) citizen with the contest between groups holding or aspiring to hold social and economic power and organised around specific clusters of inherited principles, values and beliefs; and, what from Lotman I would call the multi-lingual mind, capable not only of appreciating but also inhabiting to an extent from inside different cultures and their world views, and different knowledge systems and their ways of making sense, as these are expressed in different languages. And such adult citizens grow from the potentials with which they are born, neatly summarised in the title of a publication about early childhood education, <i>Born Creative</i>.<sup><a id="note_26" href="#note26">26</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">The human capacity for learning would become the focus of an education state’s knowledge policies. It would not “pick winners” from the extraordinary diversity of human knowledge, but instead it would invest in ensuring that its citizens’ capacity for learning was resourced in ways which would permit individuals to discover more of their unique qualities of mind and take responsibility for their development. This conception contrasts absolutely with the current view that, as a person advances through the formal education system, the benefits of their learning become increasingly private, and that extrapolations from current forms of employment should determine public investment in higher education. Instead, the most advanced and adventurous thinking depends upon the will of individuals to submit themselves to that intelligent work over increasingly long periods of time with fewer and fewer incentives (Haiven, 2014: ch.4), except for the conviction of a calling or vocation, a talent not to be hidden. This is not only about advanced degrees and research; it is about the application of intelligence by anyone to the complexities of living in the world (given and social) as they are manifested and encountered experientially, and the consequent possibility of innovation in knowledge and practice. As I will argue later in this chapter and in <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a>, the complexities of artistic and poetic composition bring these issues fully into view.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s3.4"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-4">4. Cultural Policy in from the Margins?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The proposition to be investigated in this section is that the knowledge and innovation policies of an education state will be formed on a foundation of cultural policy. Limiting the possibilities for innovation to one type of knowledge is profoundly constraining of policy thinking on behalf of the public interest, and therefore on the ability of a society to do in a more considered way what its citizens have to do all the time, which is to work out viable solutions to the always new challenges presented to them by the world in which they find themselves and by them to that world.</p>
<p class="noindent1">“Innovation policy” and “cultural policy” are hardly self-explanatory terms. Each embeds in itself a history of cultural, economic, and organisational change which is embodied, for example, in the way in which different government agencies over time have identified their purposes with either term. It is unlikely that any two governments will distribute the activities and responsibilities associated with each term in the same way, although it would be fairly certain at present that innovation policy is usually associated with the politically powerful domains of the economy, industry, science and technology, and cultural policy with the politically disempowered domains of the arts, media, ethnic relations, and the conservation of the environment and the past, including inherited and traditional knowledge – except where aspects of them are perceived to have economic value, as in the creative economy and tourism.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In public discourse the terms science and technology have achieved freedom from any particular institutional affiliation, the complete contrary of the term humanities. They include social sciences within their range of reference, and also the human, so that there is, in effect, nothing left over which apparently cannot be brought within the scope of science.<sup><a id="note_27" href="#note27">27</a></sup> This totalising claim to know truly is powerfully reinforced by the compelling ways in which the technological applications of scientific knowledge have demonstrable (in experience and through visual media) and material (especially economic) effects in all dimensions of human life and the given world. It cannot be surprising that the link between innovation and knowledge is now typically made through the competitive provision of goods and services in a market economy. It is harder to count or monetise innovations in thought, self-conception, social practices or values; but not impossible, as social media organisations are demonstrating.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Knowledge and innovation policy in a democratic society must nonetheless be sensitive to the various types of knowledge which constitute its stocks of objectified knowledge. As Brier (2008: 116) observes, “The concept of ‘paradigms of knowledge’ – as opposed to paradigms of science – means that systematized, reflected and publicly communicated types of knowledge exist besides those normally referred to as science. […] much of the knowledge collected and systematized in the arts and humanities is qualitatively different from the knowledge produced in the sciences.” Under the paradigm of science, quantitative methods of description and analysis link university, government, industry and business in a common discourse for the creation, evaluation, administration and use of knowledge; there is no paradigm under which qualitative and interpretive methods characteristic of the arts and humanities can at present achieve a comparable standing with government. Furthermore, the issue is broader than the relations between humanistic and scientific knowledge within Western knowledge traditions. Globalisation has served to advance further the claims to universality of science and technology; but it has also served to highlight the complex effects of location, social and political history, and cultural traditions on the reception of science and technology - in Western as well as other societies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To establish a cultural paradigm for knowledge policy became a particular goal for HUMANZ; it was initiated by the adoption of the term cultural knowledge, which was to be understood to refer to</p>
<p class="quote">a nation’s whole stock of knowledge (including science and technology), as that knowledge is shaped by values, beliefs and traditions, as well as the knowledge created by artists and by people in the ordinary processes of social living.<sup><a id="note_28" href="#note28">28</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">In one respect, this book is an extended consideration of that attempt at definition, which sought to establish an account of knowledge as it is marked by culture in its creation and application to social purposes. It located the process of knowledge formation in human perception, thought and action, but it did not claim a universal scope of application for such knowledge. Cultural knowledge originates and is sustained in a locality, it is a communal possession which is revised over time by communal processes, it incorporates communal values and interprets communal history, and it orders and interprets human experience. Its multiple components include knowledge institutions which make and support truth claims, memory institutions for conserving what society collectively knows, political institutions for negotiating competing truth claims, social practices, and singular minds. Within the global dynamic of the semiosphere, cultural knowledge in any postmodern society is the product of interactions between the multiplicity of cultures, histories and languages inhabiting a particular locality or region, and those forms of knowledge which possess a universality of reference and application, like science and technology, or aspire to it, like human rights law.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A way of thinking about how to re-orient current assumptions about the value and use of different kinds of knowledge in policy formation by adopting a cultural paradigm is pointed to by Brier (2008: 140) when he writes that</p>
<p class="quote">the emergence of different kinds of knowledge types [is] related to the kind of objects our culture defines in the world. All are necessary and irreducible. The sciences deal with the hidden order behind the dynamics of objects. Religion is concerned with hidden non-material forces and order, which some presume to govern our existence. Art includes the production of fictional objects. Politics is the creation of a non-material collective of fictional goals, such as democracy or a sustainable society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Considering knowledge in relation to the ways a specific culture orders the world it inhabits and as always emergent in a specific cultural space repositions thinking about the interactivity of innovation and culture. Reciprocally, the four types of knowledge that Brier identifies are together constitutive of modern Western culture; the four types each have their own integrity and function within Western culture, and cannot be substituted for by any of the others. Even more important for my interests is Brier’s structural pairing, in which two types share the function of making apparent what is hidden, and two share the materialisation of fictions. I have already argued for the inclusion of fiction as a source of valid knowledge, and I will extend that discussion later. In effect, in Brier’s account science, religion, art and politics provide the coordinates of the space of Western culture in the semiosphere, the space of thought in which innovation as emergent thought is as much a product of the human capacity for thinking fictionally as it is of thinking scientifically.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Working within a cultural paradigm embraces the widest spectrum of human knowledge creating activity. It is the responsibility of the democratic state in its role of representing and thinking with the whole of human knowledge (and not of enterprises with a very delimited focus, like firms) to frame its deliberations, calculations, and decisions to act within a cultural knowledge paradigm. Granting equality to quantitative and qualitative modes of knowing is one step, and another is accepting that scientific knowledge can only be put to work in contexts which are enmeshed in culture. Hence, if within science or any other form of systematic or formal knowledge it is methods and procedures which determine the validity of the knowledge produced, in government and society it is <i>the interpretation of that knowledge and its application through the lens of culture</i> which matters most. Currently in Aotearoa New Zealand this distinction is recognised through the claims for the distinctiveness of Māori culture which are embodied in the Treaty of Waitangi and have been most recently and brilliantly expressed in the Waitangi Tribunal’s report <i>Ko Aotearoa Tēnei</i>. This document makes it clear that knowledge policies are cultural policies, and are intrinsically political in the values they entrench and promote. It exposes the silent subsumption of diverse modes of knowing in Pakeha culture by technocratic decision-making as a universal method substituted in policy development for negotiations foregrounding the local complexities of culturally and historically contextualised knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The scope of cultural policy for a postmodern innovation or knowledge society must be reconfigured so as to locate cultural knowledge at the core of innovation, even if present policy is oriented quite differently by a technoscientific conception of knowledge. Although creativity, once the distinguishing attribute of the romantic artist, is now taken to be a key factor in the operation of the technoscientific innovation economy, the hold on policy formation by the technosciences is only strengthened. The rest of this chapter will consider in what ways cultural policy development during the past two decades has attempted to reposition itself and to widen its claim to value for government. The evidential texts are primarily those of the New Zealand government, but some Australian government documents will be consulted. While cultural knowledge originates locally, these texts represent national perspectives within a global flow of cultural policy thinking.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s3.5"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-5">5. Culture in cultural policy</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">It is well recognised that there are two distinct conceptions of culture animating cultural policies. One is aesthetic, to do with the creative and performing arts, and the other is anthropological<sup><a id="note_29" href="#note29">29</a></sup>; and it is the former which is dominant, increasingly so now that the economic value and potential of the arts have become more fully recognised and documented. But it is the latter which is the more important for my argument here, because my concern is with knowledge and the question of the relation of art works to knowledge is by-passed by the emphasis on the art work as a marketable product. This is one reason why it is conventional to speak of the arts <u>and</u> the humanities, affirming a complementary relationship but without clarifying the different relations to knowledge implicit in the link. I will take up this matter further below and in <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A very simple description of culture is given by Lotman when he refers to a “way of thinking” (1990: 239), a description the implications of which become more apparent when he writes that “The individual human intellect does not have a monopoly in the work of thinking. Semiotic systems, both separately and together as the integrated unity of the semiosphere, both synchronically and in all the depths of historical memory, carry out intellectual operations, preserve, rework and increase the store of information. Thought is within us, but we are within thought […] it is both something engendered by the human brain and something surrounding us without which intellectual generation would be impossible” (273). It takes the whole of his <i>Universe of the Mind</i> and concepts of language, text, history, memory, translation, collective consciousness, semiotic space and semiosphere to elaborate the meaning of this nexus of relations into his account of the complex and distinctive work of culture in the creation, conservation and dissemination of knowledge. To follow him in “this work of thinking” is to discover the ground in culture of a new humanities and a transformed conception of cultural policy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Another valuable angle on these basic issues is provided by Debray (2000) in his enquiry into the relations between technology and culture. I will take up his argument more fully in <a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter Four</a> in a consideration of media policy; but his conception of culture is directly relevant here. He affirms that “Culture is on the side of the vital principle, whose nature is to be multiple, disruptive, and proliferous” (61), and he takes the term culture to denote “the system of practices, codes, rules, and expectations appertaining to a historically constituted group […] the repertory of forms, intuitive schemas, and corporealized memories every society makes available to its members. […] A <i>cultural system</i> ensures, for one given locality and only one, those coherences that are knitted between periods and generations” (50, 52). Just as Lotman demonstrates how the semiosphere is constituted by the diverse kinds of knowledge generated by people participating in different cultures distributed across time and space, and how interaction between these bodies of culturally inflected knowledge is the fundamental source of innovation, so Debray stresses the energetic, efflorescent and multiply inventive qualities of cultural knowledge, its capacity for generating multiplicities rather than unities, its defining of and by a specific time-place location which stretches across human generations. He also illustrates Lotman’s account of thought in a way which makes some of its implications more explicit when he offers himself as a specific example of the transmission processes so integral to the formation and reformation of cultural knowledge over time:</p>
<p class="quote">By materializing my experience, I detach it from myself and allow it to survive me. I extract it from its experiential context and thus make it available to others, infinitely usable and appropriable (by whoever possesses the code). I pass on the intransitive. I virtually make my singularity collective, enabling a future collective to make a return to the past and identify me now (then) as having been singular. I give power of attorney to others to live and think vicariously what I lived and thought. And I myself cannot internalize anything but what has been externalized before me, in such a manner that the link from within one person to the inwardness of another who is not yet born will be made via an outwardness, a crafted materiality, a witness to the great relay race of generations (2000: 72).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Culture is a property of all singular human beings as we are locally embodied in time and space, a birthright and an inheritance, the ground of meaning and purpose, a source of energy animating social action, as many-faceted and dynamic as human experience has been throughout time and in diverse places, a mode of knowing which can integrate all kinds of knowledge into livable hypotheses about our humanity and the universe we find ourselves in.<sup><a id="note_30" href="#note30">30</a></sup> If culture is the principal human means of negotiating knowledgably with the unknown, the past and the future, each other, and the double fact of consciousness of the self and of the death of the self, and is the source of the often profound differences between people and communities demonstrated in the work required to formulate, enact and gain consent for collective social goals, it is also the means most used by authoritarian states and dominant groups to distinguish between citizens and aliens, reducing what is complex, emergent, open and multiple to a closed and exclusive unity. A fundamental role of the democratic state is to promote and protect what de Certeau (1997) called “culture in the plural”, because that is the condition of culture amongst the publics of a democracy and it is from that plurality and the transformations of thought and experience which it makes possible that the capacity of that state to innovate derives.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In their study of cultural policy, Miller and Yudice (2002) make a compelling case for an intimate link between culture and citizenship, in which concepts of both culture and citizenship are mutually modified in historical developments that are centred on an on-going political contest over concepts of the state. As they observe, “in its role as custodian of nationalism, the idealized Western state endeavours to form cultural citizens who will be virtuous political participants through self-scrutiny and self-improvement. This pedagogic style may appeal to national objectives of economic or cultural growth, patriotism, educating populations into artistic appreciation, or ‘unlocking’ creative talent that awaits the opportunity to express itself” (25). In other words, ideally this work is accomplished through education, not coercion; but its postmodern context of the globalisation of labour and the inhabiting of the same territorial space by groups distinguished by history, language, religion, mores and social practices but linked globally and to a different territorial origin has rendered the content of that education profoundly problematic. This is exactly why cultural policy is foundational, why it is intensely political, and why it must be integrated in government thinking so that the richness of potential in the interaction of citizens with quite incommensurate cultural inheritances can be foregrounded over the perceived threat to social order and national identity deriving from cultural differences. Miller and Yudice present their study of cultural policy under seven headings: “governmentality, taste, ethical incompleteness, alibis for funding, national and supranational projects, cultural citizenship and cultural policy studies” (3). The latter is the expert or disciplinary field framing but also challenged by their analysis, a field which, for them, raises a passing question about the relationship between the humanities and the social sciences – passing because they then position their approach against “value-free” conceptions of social scientific research and do not comment further on whether they would regard their value-laden approach as “in the humanities”. This is important for any concern with a new humanities, because it is quite clear that the domains of social analysis embraced by the social sciences are also domains in which the humanities have a fundamental interest. Their seven headings inform a conclusion which it is one purpose of my study to foreground and claim for a new humanities: “Looking at cultural policy through the lens of cultural studies encourages us towards innovative ways of understanding the circulation of texts, how certain forms of cultural expression are privileged and with what effect, such that the systemic inequalities of a society can be both highlighted and countered. Ideally”, they write, “citizenship can be more than a collection of rights (that are routinely denied to many subjects). Citizenship can be a site for empowering critique-in-principle of social arrangements, for transcending existing structures of economy and polity by connecting to social movements” (191). An effect of thinking this way is to bring into the foreground cultural differences as lenses through which collective or objectified knowledge may be interpretively (re)framed and so make possible productive ways of thinking which are not already inherent in or prescribed by that collective knowledge. Cultural differences, from this perspective, are integral to a conception of postmodern democratic citizenship and a complexly human resource from which new possibilities of social and economic innovation can be articulated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is culture as the sustaining fabric of meaningful social life over generations that has to provide the base for cultural policy formation, and not, as at present, the special case represented by the creative and performing arts. As a report to the European Union states, “culture is not only limited to the traditional fields of the arts and letters, but also encompasses science and the entire body of knowledge and experience which our human societies have been consolidating over the centuries” (European Commission, 2011: 2.5). Without a model of the cultural system and the forms of knowledge characteristic of it, policies concerning the role of culture in innovation in a democratic knowledge society cannot be adequately formulated.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s3.6"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-6">6. Evolving Cultural Policy</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Cultural policy, currently, is the name for that domain of governmental thought which, in respect of a society’s resources of knowledge, refers to but does not necessarily gather together what is left over when techno-scientific knowledge and economic policies have been determined. Its potential is disabled by a practice which privileges only one part of the fundamental knowledge resources of a postmodern society. This is not to say that a remarkably evolved literature on the manifold dimensions of the world(s) of knowledge signified by the term culture is not available to policy makers, but this literature cannot be engaged in a coherent manner with the agencies of the neoliberal state and the dominant interests shaping the official thought of such a state.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This point can be illustrated by reference to any democratic system of governmental administration, in which the representation of the techno-scientific system is rendered coherent by the convergence in coordinated policy agencies of research institutes, production systems, business and employment, finance and markets which are all based on universalist scientific and technical knowledge and primarily located in the private sector. Within this framework for generating policy, culture can be absorbed in the form of another class of products with measurable and market-determined economic value. Cultural policy which focuses on the creative arts, design, performance in its various modalities, publishing in all media, tourism, traditional culture and heritage from the perspective of their contribution to the economy adopts the same technocratic language but without achieving the same coherence of approach.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This form of inclusion in policy is highly reductive and does not overcome the contradictory and often marginal positioning of public sector cultural agencies in policy processes. An important difference is the effective disconnect in respect of cultural production between the products themselves, their creators, and the resources of knowledge which make their creation possible. The apparatus for arguing the importance of scientific knowledge to (innovative) product creation is intensively developed; it is difficult to find any conception in policy thinking of the knowledge base of cultural production (as distinct from the techné of each industry, craft, media form or technology) or that it is just as important (if not more important) for innovation than the more specialised science sector. By contrast to the science-technology-industry nexus, the domain of culture is rendered incoherent (or highly differentiated) by a variety of factors: the historical evolution of media systems and cultural institutions, their dispersal across public and private sectors, their embeddedness much more extensively in society than in the space demarcated by the market economy, their critical functions in the conservation and dissemination of cultural knowledge, and their local rather than universal reference; the development of product branding using cultural symbols; the interaction of indigenous and settler populations in the on-going formation and revision of concepts of national identity and law in post-colonial states; the determination of citizenship; the distinctive formation of the various institutions of the public, private and non-governmental sectors and the forms of relation established with citizens; political parties as cultural constructs; the special significance of cultural difference and self-awareness in the operation of the judicial and intelligence systems, including the legal profession, the courts, the prisons, and the police; the importance in local government of culturally coherent communities, urban and rural; the role of culture and history in architecture, design, fashion, tourism and public events.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A new approach to cultural policy must accept this diversity rather than attempt to rationalise it or prioritise its parts, and shift the focus of its work. One aspect of the meaning of the term culture as de Certeau analyses it is “Modes of behaviour, institutions, ideologies and myths that compose frames of reference and whose totality, whether it is coherent or not, distinguishes one society from another” (1997: 103). Understanding these (multiple) frames of reference and their active components is a necessary first step in apprehending the energies and motives animating a society’s citizens. As Ahearne writes in his consideration of de Certeau’s enquiry into the foundations of cultural policy, “The intervention he posits is designed less to model society than to enable the individuals and groups that compose that society to intervene more forcefully in the shaping of their own social world” (2001: 456). For this to happen, it is necessary to maintain a plurality of interpretive systems, and to create conditions of possibility rather than to determine forms of development. In striking contrast to much policy work, Ahearne states that “Cultural policy, in de Certeau’s account, must presuppose a disseminated creativity that exceeds it, and that it certainly cannot create” (460).</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.7"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-7">6.1 Recent (local) History</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">New designs for government agencies responsible for cultural policy have been introduced in recent decades, eg the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in the United Kingdom, the Department of Communication, IT and the Arts in Australia. These various arrangements of the cultural field seem to recognise that the modern conventions determining relations between culture and other spheres of the responsibilities of government have begun to break down in postmodern societies and new relationships and values are taking their place. A local version of these reformulations is to be found in cultural policy developments in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I will briefly consider several documents which I am taking to exemplify the processes shaping government thinking during the past three decades, as they have manifested themselves in Aotearoa New Zealand and demonstrate the changing position defined for culture and artistic work. As with every other topic requiring presence in this book, the bibliography is very extensive and the discourses influential in official thinking are international in origin and circulation, and I will only refer to a few examples. But with the hindsight of two decades of attention to knowledge and cultural policy formation in New Zealand, what is most striking is the increasing dominance, through various iterations, of the conception of the market economy and its corollary, that the primary task of government is economic development. Key terms like research, innovation, globalisation, digitisation, information technology, intellectual property, trade and national identity were once exciting and through them it seemed possible to grasp the future; it is also the case that much of the excitement associated with them has dissipated and their usage has assumed such self-evidence that the line between policy discourse and ritual incantation has become hard to discern. This discourse determined what aspects of the arts, culture and the humanities could be visible to public policy formation; from the perspective of those domains internationally, it was as though a fog had descended, concealing their traditional and inherent qualities and social purposes. To become visible in the policy framework shaped by technoscience and neoliberalism required both new claims for value and reductive, market-based definitions of the role and work of public cultural and educational institutions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Very well informed accounts of the cultural policy context for this period in Aotearoa New Zealand have been written by Michael Volkerling (2000) and Peter Skilling (2005, 2008, 2010), and I do not propose to repeat their work. Their conclusions, however, are important here because they confirm the general coordinates of my analysis of the situation of the humanities, without the humanities being a matter of specific concern to them. The reason for this is straightforward, and another dimension of the problem facing the humanities in claiming any role in relation to policy formation; the discipline contexts of Volkerling’s (2000) and Skilling’s work are social scientific and, even if apparently unable to influence policy thinking, they at least employ a discourse which is recognisable to the conventions of technocratic thought.</p>
<p class="noindent1">During the 1990s the Ministry which set the pace for innovation policy was the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MRST). Its most recent iteration is as part of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the title of which adequately symbolises the actual priorities of the current government by subordinating knowledge policy to its business uses. MRST’s establishment in 1991 at the same time as the Ministry of Cultural Affairs (MCA), both intended to act as policy ministries in a recollection of Snow’s two cultures, is highly significant because of the subsequent histories of both. MRST rapidly evolved into the intellectual and policy leader for national knowledge policy formation (perhaps the nearest New Zealand has come to a public research policy oriented think tank), assumed a central role in government, and brought increasing funding into the technoscientific domain, whereas MCA remained marginal, both incomplete – the Department of Internal Affairs retained Historical Publications until 2000 – and usually outside Cabinet, except for the period when Prime Minister Helen Clark was also Minister of Arts and Culture.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Could MCA have articulated a brief as wide as that developed in MRST, embracing potentially the whole knowledge field from a cultural perspective as MRST so effectively did from a science and technology perspective? The New Zealand government has partially moved beyond the categorisations of the early neoliberal period, in which cultural knowledge was belatedly categorised with education and social welfare as constituting, under the aegis of social capital, the integrating social framework within which the risk of social disintegration inherent in the operation of market forces was supposed to be contained, bringing the economic role of cultural production to the fore.<sup><a id="note_31" href="#note31">31</a></sup> That MCA could not achieve a policy role comparable to MRST is itself a compelling marker of the profound imbalance in government policy formation in the 1980s and 1990s. One effect is the continuing fragmentation in policy of the cultural sector as it struggles to redress its long-term marginalisation by the economic and policy dominance of primary and manufacturing industry. The redefining of MCA as the Ministry for Culture and Heritage (MCH) in 2000 effectively rendered it as the visible part of an incomplete Ministry of Social Capital, an incomplete Ministry of Cultural Industry, and an unacknowledged Ministry for the Humanities.<sup><a id="note_32" href="#note32">32</a></sup> As the Ministry’s report <i>Cultural Policy in New Zealand</i> (2007) observed, “There is no single piece of legislation relating to cultural policy” (10). Subsequently, it has assumed responsibility for Sport and Recreation, following the lead of the United Kingdom Department of Culture, Media and Sport.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As Volkerling and Skilling demonstrate, culture and the arts came into the frame of knowledge-based economic development late in the process of knowledge policy development, following international models, especially that of the Blair Labour Government’s discovery of the creative industries. Under the pressure of the demand to articulate the economic value of domains of traditionally publicly funded activity like the arts, culture and heritage, and education, Western governments detached the term creative from the arts and applied it instead to industrial products employing twentieth century media technologies and culturally-derived content. The other important strand was the displacement of the welfare society by the risk society, and the belated discovery in the context of economic globalisation that social cohesion grounded in strong concepts of social identity – communal and national - were critical for a society to sustain individualism and the free market without imploding. As both Volkerling and Skilling point out, the concept of national identity served two otherwise distinct purposes in the context of globalisation: this of social cohesion, and the other of product branding as the means of gaining competitive advantage. The latter is especially important for its recognition that the work of creating and disseminating national identity is accomplished by media systems and sign values, a fiction-making process which, as a recent Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key, has acknowledged with respect to the “100% pure New Zealand” brand, needs to have only an approximate connection to the actual condition of New Zealand’s environment; what matters is the ability of brand imagery to connect international values to claims for the quality of the products marketed according to the meanings communicated and substantiated by imagery of the natural environment. The fact that Sir Peter Jackson’s use of New Zealand settings in the Tolkien films has had the effect of product placement on a grand scale, including a stimulus to tourists wanting to visit the locations at which the films were made, is just the best New Zealand example of this process of value creation by media representation. The move to make fully the link between culture, heritage, the arts and the economy is succinctly demonstrated in the decision of Prime Minister Key to make himself the Minister, not of arts, culture and heritage, as his predecessor did, but of tourism. As a consistent extrapolation from this shift of orientation, Key’s leadership of a project to design a new national flag (a project led by MCH) had apparently no constitutional significance, but was conceived as a branding exercise. Its failure demonstrated vividly how a multiplicity of divergent cultural values can coalesce in a semiotic object and frustrate an official attempt to determine the meanings attributed to it.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In part, since both MRST and MCA had mandates which emphasised national culture and identity, the critical difference between them was the conception of culture informing the work of both. For MRST, it was the knowledge, systems of belief, traditions and myths which informed the thinking of New Zealanders about themselves as a nation, which could both support and impede the evolution of a science-based knowledge society and economy in New Zealand; for MCA it was primarily the traditions and practices of European literary, visual and performing arts and their evolution as the literature, music, painting, dance, sculpture, etc. of New Zealand which defined policy thinking. For both, the increasing presence in government and the public domain of Māori knowledge traditions and artistic practices posed difficult and important questions: Is there such a thing as Māori science or Māori mathematics? How can artistic achievement in Māori and European art be compared? Can the same criteria be used to allocate funding to research or artistic practice in both knowledge traditions? Who is qualified to decide?</p>
<p class="noindent1">The problems facing both Ministries in respect of knowledge policy were quite different. For MRST, the simple fact was that the knowledge of universal economic value was modern techno-scientific knowledge communicated globally in English and mathematics and created, disseminated and applied by means of a powerful and complex, international infrastructure of universities and other public and private research organisations, public and private research funding, and industry; the conception of modern societies and their economies as underpinned (or even defined) by techno-scientific knowledge was taken for granted. Furthermore, the epistemic shift characterising cultural change in the late twentieth century under the rubric of the knowledge society was most clearly exemplified by the invention and rapid evolution of digital ICTs, techno-scientific research and development in a very powerful form. For MCA/MCH, there was no equivalent simple fact: its policy field was divided by the historical formation and separate development of various art forms and cultural institutions, some of which (National Archives, the National Library, public broadcasting) were not within its scope, its role in innovation funding was carried out through the funding of new work in the creative arts, and it had no responsibility for research funding (in part because there were effectively no sources of public funding for research in the various fields associated with the arts and the humanities, other than the bulk funding of the universities). Unlike the United States of America, for example, there was no National Endowment of the Humanities to lead in research policy formation and programme development in these knowledge domains with their roots in the arts, culture and the humanities; unlike the United Kingdom, there was no Arts and Humanities Research Council. When the Historical Publications Group moved from the Department of Internal Affairs to MCH in 2000, MCH became the home for the only national humanities research projects – The Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, the Historical Atlas of New Zealand, and Te Ara The On-line Encyclopedia of Aotearoa New Zealand – although MCH has never publicly acknowledged that that is what they are<sup><a id="note_33" href="#note33">33</a></sup>. But the driving conception of the knowledge or innovation society informing government policy had no room for the fields linked to MCH, except for creative industries.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s3.8"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-8">7. Innovation Policy: the Arts and Culture</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">In its present articulation in New Zealand, innovation is conceived as a function of economic globalisation; it is future oriented because it is the product of economic competition between firms seeking to establish new markets. Innovation in this mode becomes a matter of government policy formation because too many of the social, political and economic factors involved in innovation are beyond the capacity, competence and resources of business firms to manage. In this mode, one might argue that the balance of advantage in the policy process deriving from this arrangement is tilted very much towards firms and their shareholders, rather than towards the state and its citizens. This disparity is intensified because private investment in R &amp; D in 2002 was only 28% of the total investment in New Zealand in contrast to the OECD average of 71%.<sup><a id="note_34" href="#note34">34</a></sup> More than a decade later, The Ministry of Business, innovation and Employment (2015) states that “New Zealand’s investment in R&amp;D is low compared to other small advanced economies, although public investment has grown significantly – by over 70 per cent – since 2007/08.14 New Zealand’s level of business R&amp;D, although also growing, remains particularly low” (50). The report provides significant information about the complex relations between the state, local and international business, and public institutions in producing research in a small nation, and at one point makes the following observation: “high-impact research cannot always be valued in economic terms alone. For example, the impact of endangered species protection could be considered in terms of economic (tourism revenue), environmental (role in the ecosystem), and cultural or social (as taonga or public amenity) values” (11). What would result from reversing the order in this statement? An innovation policy driven by a conception of the state’s responsibility for managing the future sustainably on behalf of its citizens would certainly involve business as a critical aspect of its implementation, but it would not be defined primarily by science and business interests. Innovation as a values-based and socially induced, managed, and purposeful mode of response to human needs, global economic competition and environmental challenges (mostly now produced by human action), should be shaped by public (cultural and local) imperatives and values.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.9"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-9">7.1 Foresight</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">However, agenda setting was the task of MRST (together with the Ministry of Economic Development). As one mark of this process, the Ministry undertook the Foresight project, beginning in 1997, the aim of which was to explore and clarify a strategic vision for the future of New Zealand which could guide government policies and would assist those subject to these policies to be prepared for the introduction of new investment priorities in 2000.<sup><a id="note_35" href="#note35">35</a></sup> Its principal outcome was <i>Building Tomorrow’s Success: Guidelines for Thinking Beyond Today</i> (March 1998). The scenario methodology fundamental to Foresight was used by participants in the project from business and government to develop three “scenarios for New Zealand’s future”, mini-narratives which were entitled “Possum in the Glare”, “Shark”, and “Kahikatea”. The larger purpose was educational, to accustom people in business, government and research to the use of scenario development for strategic thinking in their enterprises by providing practical experience and also by publishing an account modelling this approach to strategic planning. The focus was the knowledge revolution, and the social transformations projected to generate a post-industrial society. A paragraph headed “Knowledge and our Future” defined a knowledge society in terms which were new then but are taken for granted now (even if their achievement is still prospective rather than actual and the strategic goal is no longer a complex, new modality of society but a percentage of economic growth):</p>
<p class="quote">In this type of society, individuals who are well-educated, self-motivated, and linked into information networks, are the most likely to live prosperous and fulfilling lives. Enterprises that are attuned to their customers’ requirements, employ educated workers, encourage innovation through their workplace organisation, and know more and learn faster than their competitors, are the most likely to succeed and grow. At the national level, societies that maximise opportunities for individuals and enterprises to develop knowledge-age skills and access knowledge-age services, and that enable people to share a common sense of national identity and belonging, are the most likely to be cohesive (8).</p>
<p class="noindent1">While knowledge is defined inclusively as “information in any form, know-how and know-why” (8) innovation and growth in modern economies is understood to be based on science and technology knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As narratives, these scenarios stood aside from the normal mode of policy discourse, and fictionally integrated ideological, moral and cultural values with their primary focus on economic development. Even if the narratives remained highly conventional in their beginning-middle-end structure and their realism, and have no characters<sup><a id="note_36" href="#note36">36</a></sup>, they made the actual grounding of policy formation and choices in ideological positions and cultural values explicit. The first two were variations on the neoliberal risk economy; the third was a “green” and indigenous cultural conception in which New Zealand became a world leader in social and ecological innovation: New Zealand would become “the global centre of innovation in socio-technical systems – a new way of integrating individual and social needs with technology and science” (32). Ironically, this scenario in many ways recovered the mode of innovation by which New Zealand has historically made its mark internationally, in which knowledge was placed at the service of social democratic development, and which its various governments under the direction of neoliberalism and a commodity-based conception of globalisation have surrendered in the past three decades.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Foresight presents one of the more remarkable developments in public and disciplinary discourses, the adoption of the term narrative (but usually in its more demotic form of “story” or “stories”) without adopting the traditional humanities disciplines for which narrative was (and is) a fundamental concept and mode of organising and presenting knowledge.<sup><a id="note_37" href="#note37">37</a></sup> Narrative, in this context, serves a double purpose. By presenting scientific and technical knowledge in the form of a realistic narrative, that knowledge is rendered more accessible to general comprehension without misrepresenting the rational, objective and methodological process by which that knowledge is formulated; and it provides the means by which the abstract discourses of technocratic policy formation and organisational management can appear to be sensitive to the individuals whose lives are shaped by the policy and management categories which represent them in government and organisational decision-making. The use in government reports of diverse images of the population, which imply stories of individual lives, and inset case studies, is a particularly significant instance of the humanising (and public relations) work narratives are intended to perform.<sup><a id="note_38" href="#note38">38</a></sup> The two qualities which must be absent from narratives employed in these ways are fictionality and imaginativeness<sup><a id="note_39" href="#note39">39</a></sup>, a restriction observed as well in modern humanities disciplines when what is represented in narrative is presented as reality, as it is or was.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.10"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-10">7.2 Growing an Innovative New Zealand</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">As one of its contributions to innovation policy after it came into office at the end of 1999, the Labour Government set up the Science and Innovation Advisory Council (SIAC). Its initial report on innovation, <i>An Innovation Framework for New Zealand</i> (2001a<i>),</i> followed by <i>New Zealanders: Innovators to the World</i> (2001b), contributed along with a number of others to <i>Growing an Innovative New Zealand</i> (2002). At the same time, a consultancy was commissioned to produce a strategic plan for the cultural sector with the double focus of cultural identity and creative industries. The result was <i>Heart of the Nation</i> (June, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The innovation reports exemplify the knowledge politics at work in these processes of policy formation. The second SIAC report aims for inclusiveness, both because “successful innovation can only happen when all aspects of our life and work are considered and all our people are able to contribute and participate”, and by affirming that “Cultural practitioners are pre-eminently innovators. Alongside our Nobel Prize winners Ernest Rutherford and Alan MacDiarmid stand creative artists like Janet Frame, Colin McCahon, and Len Lye” (2001b: 20). The report includes a quotation from what could be described as the brand leader of New Zealand poetry, Allen Curnow’s “Landfall in Unknown Seas”, as the epigraph to its section on the way to achieve economic transformation: “Simply by sailing in a new direction/ You could enlarge the world.” The report readily interprets the lines figuratively to exemplify an entrepreneurial, economy-transforming attitude; what it overlooks, taking the lines literally, is the core problem animating SIAC’s report, that is, that there is no longer any empty territorial/physical resource space for enterprise or government to expand into and exploit. The knowledge society can be thought of as the result of this impediment and the search for new kinds of exploitable resource from which economic value can be derived - the metaphor in a heading from the report, “Mine the global knowledge base”, is a perfect example. Just as the classification of uncolonised space as empty has been discovered to have been an act of cultural imperialism and erasure, so the discovery of knowledge not as a background to economic production but as a key resource in it raises fundamental questions about knowledge as always already cultural knowledge, marked by cultural values, ownership and the historical and geographical contexts of cultural production. In respect of the knowledge commons, one might conclude that the terra nullius principle still applies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The SIAC report adopts two key concepts of the period, firstly by linking enhancement of the New Zealand brand to the injunction “Leverage our cultural sector”, and secondly by invoking arts-science convergence in the proposition that “Artists use science to inspire and inform their work; scientists and technologists use artists to image and explain their processes” (48). The secondary relation of the arts to techno-science described here has been recently affirmed by the mode of presence of the arts in the movie <i>Particle Fever</i> (2013) as ornaments to the real marvel, the Great Hadron Collider, as the materialisation of the most advanced techno-scientific knowledge and, in the original sense of the term, truly a work of art. I regard these inclusions as a mark of generosity, even if they betray at the same time incomprehension about the processes of artistic creativity and how that mode of thought and work and the knowledge deriving from it could be considered to have equality with technoscience in policies for innovation.<sup><a id="note_40" href="#note40">40</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">More significantly, the official innovation report, while naming the SIAC report as a major resource, entirely omits all references to the arts. It defines innovation policy as having three branches: biotechnology, information technology, and creative industries, and makes the third in effect a subset of the second while precisely locating the origin of the concept of creative industries:</p>
<p class="quote">Britain's Creative Task Force has defined the creative industries as ‘those activities which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent, and which have the potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property.’ The sector is very diverse, including industries such as Advertising, Architecture, Art, Design, Fashion, Film and Video, Music, Performing Arts, Publishing, and Television and Radio. (56)</p>
<p class="noindent1">The only reference to artists is to the graphic artists working for Weta Studios on <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy. Of the three priority areas identified in the innovation policy, it is the creative or cultural industries which apparently provide a link between culture and innovation. It is also the case that this area is the least developed in the policy paper; both there and in public commentary, the exemplary case is the film version of <i>The</i> <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, and what are seen to make it exemplary are its innovations in digital effects, which are taken to demonstrate (as is Design, the other most quoted field) a direct link between science, technology and creativity. It is not that these attributions are mistaken; but they effectively render the cultural as an extension of the science-industry nexus and make clear how the dominant discourse shaping government policy formation for innovation had no model available to it which could provide an account of the processes of cultural creation. They effectively block consideration of what could be radical about the inclusion of “the cultural” in a technoscientific conception of innovation. As critiques of this policy move show, its purpose and effect is to provide the means of commodifying and monetising culture. SIAC’s imperative section headed “Leverage our cultural sector” (2001b: 45-46) makes this point with brutal simplicity. According to the final report, OPM (2002: 57) the Cultural Industries sector “leverages off New Zealand’s unique culture and capabilities.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the innovation policy had been conceptualised from a cultural perspective, that is, by foregrounding the characteristics of cultural knowledge production as its model - its resource base in symbolic objects and their capacity for reflexivity and recombination, its institutional configuration, its ecological character as the meanings produced from a group’s engagement with its locality and with other groups over time - a more culturally responsive and hence productive innovation policy may have been the outcome. The policy fails to provide any clue about how cultural production could be a full partner with scientific research and technology development in an innovation system, an outcome confirmed by the sidelining of the <i>Heart of the Nation</i> report.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Debray (2000) wrote that “a lineage of cultural evolution singles out, from a complex of available innovations, the ones most meaningful to it and that it alone can best optimize” (50). Does knowledge or innovation policy produced in New Zealand pass this test? In one obvious sense it does, because it is a consistent (if always debatable) deduction from a local history of technoscience-based economic development, a distinguishing attribute of Pakeha culture with the political authority to impose its lineage. But, a more inclusive view of the national cultural knowledge-base, and a conception of the overview role of a democratic government with respect to the (im)balance of powers among groups and traditions and their local and global contexts, would require a knowledge policy, formulated as cultural policy, to adopt a view of national cultural evolution as the basis for identifying national priorities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A good example of what this might require is provided by the branding of New Zealand as “100% pure New Zealand” and the refusal of government to accept that organics as a system of land management for food production could be more consistent with that branding than modern industrial agriculture. Although the three priority areas were based on domains of knowledge work (research and its application) in which New Zealand had demonstrated internationally recognised achievement, it is not the case that these areas were selected because they were identified from an assessment of “innovations […] that it alone can best optimize.” They were chosen because they met the double requirement that they are fields of research and development of high economic value and in which New Zealand had already developed expertise, infrastructure and investment. This does not mean, obviously, that they might not have been the right choices; the point is that the reasons why they were chosen have nothing to do with what is distinctive about New Zealand’s “cultural evolution”. That point is confirmed by the way in which culture is not at any point identified as a source of innovation (but is often represented as an obstacle to change) and is placed in the background as the local context, like the environment, in which knowledge work determined by international measures of value is done.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In an analysis seeking to explain the role in innovation of the United States Sunbelt, Suarez-Villa concluded that “Historical specificity and institutional context may play a more significant role than anyone so far has given them credit for.”<sup><a id="note_41" href="#note41">41</a></sup> The role of government is clearly critical to the evolution of knowledge societies because of its capacity to affect and its responsibilities towards the non-business sectors of society. Suarez-Villa (2001) observes that</p>
<p class="quote">one of the most important factors contributing to the rise of the Sunbelt was public infrastructure. Massive amounts of public resources have been spent since the late 1940s to provide many Sunbelt states with the sort of infrastructure that could support human capital development, particularly in the areas of science and technology. [...] Much public spending also went to support infrastructure that is less directly related to invention, but which is nevertheless essential for building up and exchanging technological knowledge. Such infrastructure allowed communications to occur more efficiently, and it supported other public resources which had a more direct bearing on invention. [...] The rapid expansion of public educational infrastructure was particularly important. The <i>massification</i> of educational access played a crucial part in expanding the technological knowledge of the population. Since most new inventions arise out of existing technology, expanding access to science and technology fields was fundamental for enhancing the Sunbelt’s technological human capital (175, 179).</p>
<p class="noindent1">In many respects, the strategy set out in 2002 represents a clear understanding that establishing an innovative society based on advanced technology is a long-term process involving the whole of society, not just the science, technology and business sectors, and that the public sector has to carry a very large share of the burden. Tertiary education reform is an integral part of the strategy, as is IT infrastructure. However, the dominant goal is immediate and continuing economic growth, a goal which exerts enormous pressure on short-term policy making and which consequently becomes focused on and adopts as models those knowledge sectors already seen to provide the principal resources for economic activity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A significant but only partial exception to this proposition is the inclusion of creative industries as one of the three priority areas. The opening to a revisioning of the innovation strategy in cultural terms was offered through the affirmation that “New Zealand can perform at world-class levels in [the creative industries] sector, because large parts of it are relatively independent of scale and distance. The sector also is able to leverage off New Zealand’s unique culture and capabilities, which international competitors can’t replicate.” It is a long step from these claims to the focussing of government thinking about innovation policy on what Barnett calls the “cultural setting” and the “cultural inventory”, and it is a step which has not been taken. In the terms in which the then Labour government expressed its commitment to sustainable development, which “hinges on the reality that economic development in the absence of social and environmental progress cannot be sustained” (OPM, 2002: 23), cultural policy remained off the map when it should provide the foundation for the formation of innovation and knowledge policy.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.11"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-11">7.3 Creative Nation /Heart of the Nation</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">In October 1994, the Australian Federal Government published <i>Creative Nation. Commonwealth Cultural Policy</i>. This report, the first national cultural policy (5), seemed at the time to shine a very bright light on a complex set of public organisations, cultural traditions, artistic practices, media technology developments and public funding arrangements which were lost in the shadows cast by the dominance in public policy of the techno-scientific, industrial and business nexus. An expert panel which advised on the report wrote a preamble to it which affirmed, first of all, that “Democracy is the key to cultural value” and then that “cultural policy must extend to all areas of government [… so] intricately is culture interwoven into the fabric of our life, so sensitive is it to government policies in all areas, so crucial is it to our national and personal sense of identity” (2). The Panel understood that culture “arises from the community [and] encompasses our entire mode of life, our ethics, our institutions, our manners and our routines, not only interpreting the world but shaping it”, and that the arts and sciences are “the most highly developed and imaginative aspects of our culture” (1). They argued for a Ministry of Culture with a seat in Cabinet. The report itself maintained the Panel’s conception of culture but focused on the government’s role in supporting the principal art forms, indigenous culture, heritage, cultural institutions, broadcasting (including children’s programming), tourism, and especially the new cultural (not yet creative) industries founded on digital multi-media technologies. The report affirmed that “This cultural policy is also an economic policy” (7), emphasised the government’s role in copyright policy, and asserted in respect of new media technologies and their development that “content is absolutely critical” (55); not only the new media industries but also existing cultural institutions would be providing it (57). Furthermore, the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, referred to the “great ambition” of his government “to bring cultural issues into the mainstream of our national life […] the more we succeed in encouraging a creative spirit and the flow of ideas, the more we will succeed as an economy and society.” These words are quoted by the then President of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, Deryck Schreuder, in his Foreword to the papers published after the1994 Silver Jubilee Symposium of the Academy, who registered his disappointment that “<i>Creative Nation</i> is almost silent on the specific role of the humanities” (Schreuder, 1995: ix).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Both <i>Heart of the Nation</i> and <i>Creative Nation</i> were commissioned by Labour Governments, and both reveal strong commitments to sustaining a multi-cultural conception of national identity in the face of informational globalisation, to which end the arts and media have a central role as content providers. They mark a shift which was most clearly formulated by the Blair Government’s recognition of a new class of cultural/creative industries in the United Kingdom, signified by the “Cool Britannia” brand, and its flow-on importance in shaping conceptions of a digital media-based cultural and informational dimension to the economy. But a crucial difference is identified when both reports in their print forms are placed side-by-side. <i>Creative Nation</i> is, like <i>Growing an Innovative New Zealand</i>, issued as an official report of the government, with appropriately high design and presentation values. The <i>Heart of the Nation</i> is, by contrast, a spiral bound report with a plasticised cover printed on one side of plain A4 paper and using a heavier quality buff-toned paper to carry the prefatory material. As a major attempt to reconceptualise the cultural sector in Aotearoa New Zealand, it symbolically and materially remains outside the domain of official publications, as its recommendations largely remained outside government policy (Volkerling 2001, 445-449).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Both reports are concerned to define the terms of a new strategy to replace what the <i>Heart of the Nation</i> refers to as a “traditional formulation” of the purposes of cultural policy which dated from the 1940s and was reaffirmed in <i>The Government’s Role in the Cultural Sector</i> (1998) as conserving and making accessible New Zealand’s cultural heritage, funding creative work, and providing training for the cultural professions through the education system (HoTN, 2000: 19). By contrast, Labour’s 1999 pre-election manifesto emphasised the relation between “vibrant arts and cultural activities” and the emergence of a “strong and confident cultural identity”, and the importance of cultural industries in economic growth and employment (20). <i>Heart of the Nation</i> refers to a transition from “the policy legacy of nineteenth century civic welfarism which has positioned cultural institutions and programmes as social services rather than economic assets” (103).</p>
<p class="noindent1">A strong conception of the policy moment informs both reports. In both cases the Prime Minister is the principal recipient, and not just as a formality; issues of the value of culture in the economy, for social cohesion and for shaping national identity (including for its brand value) in the context of globalising economic competition, are central themes. Furthermore, the case for elevating “Culture” to a central role in government (rather than the marginal, even outside-of-Cabinet, role common in recent decades) is focussed in the New Zealand report by proposing that culture is “the heart of the nation; an essential resource for our common future” (xvi) and that cultural policy and the range of agencies (new, reformed, and continuing) which should make up a re-visioned cultural sector should fall under the oversight of the Prime Minister. The preamble to the report notes that “Recognising that a vaster range of government departments and agencies have more cultural inputs, impacts and outcomes than could ever be encompassed by a single ministry, this plan installs leadership and responsibility where it ought to be, at the very centre of government” (v). The report also notes that an earlier restructuring which created the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Cultural Affairs as apparently complementary policy ministries had not by 2000 (and has still not) served to equalise the power relations between these components of the nation’s system for creating knowledge (100). The partial integration proposed by <i>Heart of the Nation</i> has not been accomplished in any form, whereas investment in and refocusing of the government’s role in science and technology research and development has been intensively investigated and acted upon through the decade following its publication.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Both of these policy documents attempt to look beyond their present political moment towards new conceptions of cultural policy and the role of national and local institutions; they are also, necessarily, written in response to the opportunities (and limits) presented by that moment as it is defined by the requirement that the policy case for culture should be made in terms of its role in the economy, and of the link forged in the 1990s between innovation and the advent of globalising and networked digital information and communications technologies. And, not surprisingly, the humanities are not considered to provide the fundamental knowledge out of which cultural policy could be formulated or artworks and media content created, even though, for example, <i>Heart of the Nation</i> affirms that “Culture is founded on deep knowledge” (86). The focus of both reports is on the machinery of government, recognising that redefining the roles of cultural knowledge in postmodern societies requires a “whole of society” perspective and responsibility which is only available to the state.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A fundamental issue for cultural policy concerns the role of the media system, and the responsibility of the state towards it. Both reports consider this matter closely, but the development of public media systems in Australia was already much more elaborated than in New Zealand, and the concerns expressed in <i>Heart of the Nation</i> in 2000 are simply now greater than they were for those who grasp the deep significance to cultural evolution and democratic participation of the systems of communication available to a society, and how the technologies enabling them are owned and their use regulated. The report notes that the principles informing a public broadcasting system have been abandoned over the 15 years preceding its publication, in favour of a “deregulated, privatised, and commercially driven broadcasting environment” (30), and it is particularly critical of Television New Zealand (88-89). In the period following the report, the Labour Government did rewrite the charter of TVNZ to require the provision of a public television service, which led to the establishment of a new channel, TVNZ7. The return to power of a conservative government in 2008 led to the abandoning of the public charter and, after a major public campaign against the government’s intention, the closure of TVNZ7 in 2012. Aotearoa New Zealand must be quite unique amongst Western democracies in the degree to which its media and communications systems are privately owned and serve commercial rather than public purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There is another most important dimension to the <i>Heart of the Nation</i> which has fundamental implications for the consideration of cultural knowledge policy as local rather than universal in orientation, and that is the Treaty partnership based on two languages and two cultural inheritances, Māori and Pakeha, which is distinctive to Aotearoa New Zealand. The issues raised here are typically largely elided in science and technology policy, except now for the challenge offered by the Waitangi Tribunal report, <i>Ko Aotearoa Tēnei</i>. The position adopted in <i>Heart of the Nation</i> is based on affirming “the centrality of Treaty principles to the development of cultural policy and resourcing and the need for Māori sovereignty/rangatiratanga over the development of Māori cultural resources” (7), a position which is ultimately founded on the incommensurability of the two languages and cultural traditions and the effects of the cultural politics of colonisation on the culture and identity of the colonised people. A particularly significant effect is the disjunction between indigenous and western conceptions of property rights; it is in this context, which is closely linked to the role of traditional knowledge (heritage) and the conservation of the language, that the conception of cultural sovereignty and the need for institutions to sustain it gains its full force. No conception of universally true knowledge can inform policy in this context, however much terms like indigenous and Western have global application; equally, no culture can claim sovereignty over all cultures (even if that is what imperial cultures have typically sought to do), especially because cultures evolve in dynamic relations with one another and cultural practitioners are amphibious in drawing upon local and global cultural materials in their work (81-87). It is worth noting that Māori broadcasting, now with English and Māori language television channels as well as radio, has (unlike TVNZ7) continued to develop and has achieved widespread recognition as the de facto public television service. It owes its existence to the force of the Treaty in political argument; without that it is inconceivable that the service would ever have been established.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The areas listed as components of creative industry in <i>Heart of the Nation</i> are: heritage, music, literature, urban design and architecture, design, visual arts, performing arts, digital interactive media, film and broadcasting (115). The context is the uneven provision of agencies charged with the strategic development of these components; at the time of publication, it is implied that only 3 of the 10 areas had such a function available to them. An overarching Creative Industries Development Agency was therefore proposed. As other components of the cultural field which enter the report from time to time, and which have expertise in some part of a field’s content (the National Library, for example, or any university), demonstrate, lacking a core concept and public sector structure which enables sense-making in policy contexts is disabling. The concept of “the cultural field” provides a means for thinking the diversity of institutions and organisations (including the mix of for-profit and non-profit modalities), kinds of expertise, and sources of knowledge together in the formation of relevant public policy. Its scope, which is basically the creation, conservation and use of non-genetic information in local settings, needs to be clarified so that the work of culture in postmodern societies and the facilitating role of the state can be properly articulated in a reformed cultural policy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There are good reasons, which are identified in the report’s overview, why this development has not occurred. When brought together, they demonstrate that cultural policy, if attempted in a mindset framed by techno-scientific research and development and the industrial and post-industrial economy as they have evolved together, must fail to address the core issues. The report provides a visual representation of “New Zealand’s Cultural Sector Value Chain” (xv) which strikingly locates the origin in heritage as the primary resource, and the passage of heritage into cultural products through the medium of the individual creator whose identity is given definition by that heritage: “If creative individuals are at the heart of the whole process, heritage and identity are the tap root and the foundation from which it grows” (vii). It notes the distinctive spread of organisational forms and modes of work in the cultural sector, from voluntary to non-profit and for-profit agencies, and from self-employment through what the report calls cultural enterprises to cultural industries. But an aim throughout the report, to provide certain quantitative evidence for the economic role of the cultural sector, is repeatedly frustrated because “The cultural sector, like the tourism sector it overlaps with, is not a sector that is readily identifiable and measurable using standard statistical industry classifications” (14). The point is dramatized by showing that in 2000, depending on how the sector is defined, its contribution to GNP was from 2-6%, and I will generalise the point by noting that it is impossible to offer a measure of the economic role of the humanities for the same reasons. Because government is by signs and numbers, for a sector to lack appropriate representation in the forms recognisable by government is fatal to its claims for its value and contribution to society, and therefore to a proper share of public investment. It is not surprising that the need for officially recognised forms of information about the sector is a continuing and high priority of the Ministry of Culture and Heritage.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Awareness of the dispersal of cultural work across government is fundamental to my argument for a new humanities. Both <i>Creative</i> Nation and <i>Heart of the Nation</i> envisage the possibility of coherence in cultural policy at a high level of government, but do not go further into the extra-governmental and public conditions required to achieve that coherence. In the case of <i>Heart of the Nation</i>, while its concern is to demonstrate how a new strategy could allow the cultural sector to become a more significant contributor to New Zealand’s economic and social well-being, it lacks an overarching conception of a cultural knowledge system on the basis of which its rethinking of New Zealand’s cultural infrastructure, its component parts and their cultural, social and economic roles could be fully integrated. Policy making and strategy design for the science and technology knowledge system faces no such difficulty, especially as the claim to be creative can be made as readily for practitioners in this knowledge system as it was traditionally made for artists (91). Volkerling underlines the deficiency and the obstacle to its remedy when, in his commentary on the reception of <i>Heart of the Nation</i>, he quotes the Council of Europe’s judgment that “Governments will not be able to realise their aims unless they create [structures] which match the reality of the way culture works in a society” (2000, 8).</p>
<p class="noindent1">My introduction of the term cultural field, initially into Boisot’s diagramming of the I-space, is my attempt to ground thinking about fundamental knowledge creation in culture as a dynamic process constituted by changing local combinations of specific knowledges (content, institution and medium), in which fields overlap and differentiate from one another across many dimensions of time and space. So the obvious question follows: what, then, is the basis of theoretical and practical coherence of the cultural field as a source of fundamental knowledge? The metaphor of a well-spring<sup><a id="note_42" href="#note42">42</a></sup>, notably in this era of increasing anxiety about access to clean water as a necessary condition of human survival on the planet, can identify the nature of the coherence of the cultural field and its formal knowledge system, the academic humanities. It is precisely at this point that the challenge to, and the need for, the formation of a new humanities which can fulfil this integrating function, becomes apparent.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.12"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-12">7.4 Briefing the Incoming Minister (2014)</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">One direction in which to look for an answer is recent reports and documents published by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage (MCH) before and after the 2014 election. The principal paper, <i>Briefing to the Incoming Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage: October 2014</i> (<i>Briefing</i>), is intended to inform a new Minister on the nature and scope of MCH’s (and the Minister’s) responsibilities in the portfolio; other documents provide various contexts for it.<sup><a id="note_43" href="#note43">43</a></sup> What do they have to say about “deep knowledge” or the role of the arts, culture and the humanities in the national knowledge and innovation system and the policies directing it? As Schreuder noted 20 years ago in Australia in his response to <i>Creative Nation</i>, the dominant outcome of a reading with these questions in mind is disappointment, but primarily because cultural policy thinking as these documents represent it is constrained by a mode of discourse and official expectations which prevent the difference cultural policy could and should make in government from declaring itself.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Ministry does make it clear that it is in transit from an earlier model which took culture to be equivalent to the European arts in traditional media and the institutions built to support them, to a new model based on a wider conception of culture, new media and the importance to New Zealand cultural identity of Māori culture. How that transition is understood is presented in the various reports and papers preceding the last election in 2014, in which co-ordination of policy among the various components of the cultural sector as currently defined, strategic development, and statistical description for the sector are given the highest priority. Nationhood and the economic contribution of cultural activity, especially that of the creative industries, are the twin poles around which the account of the cultural sector in government takes shape.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The documents (not surprisingly) are very focussed on describing the sector and the relations among its parts and identifying what knowledge (primarily economic and quantitative) about it is needed for the purposes of policy formation and argument internal to government concerning the relative importance of the sector in the whole spectrum of government activity. The force of the central agencies is most clearly seen in another document, the <i>Performance Improvement Framework</i>, which has much more to do with current discourses within government than it does with comprehending the public functions of culture in society, economy and the arts and the kinds of policies on behalf of the public interest which might be built on them (although that document is also interesting for making some of the more significant statements about the nature of the sector and how the term culture is understood).</p>
<p class="noindent1">What is striking to me is that, unlike any similar documents produced for the techno-science sector, these documents make no specific claims for the nature and value of the knowledge created and used by those active across the sector and, in so far as that is bounded by the scope of government, to those in the wider community who do not participate directly in the Ministry’s funded programmes. The obvious exceptions are the work of the Heritage Branch and its publications, which is linked to the role of the Ministry in sustaining and enhancing concepts of national identity and democracy, and the conservation and development of Māori language and culture, which is linked to nationhood, economic value, and the nation’s obligations to Māori under the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The words cognate with knowledge most often used are “evidence-based”, “cultural material”,<sup><a id="note_44" href="#note44">44</a></sup> “information” or “content”, as in this from <i>Briefing:</i></p>
<p class="quote">The Ministry aims to publish authoritative, accessible information to improve New Zealanders’ understanding of their nation, history and identity; to stimulate debate and engagement; and to present information about New Zealand to international audiences (MCH, 2014b: 16).</p>
<p class="noindent1">There is a neat (poetic) slippage in another expression of this view, which blends the common practice in government publications of telling (factually true) stories with the disciplinary context of the Heritage Branch’s work: “MCH has built expert capability in telling New Zealand histories for the general public and educational use” (MCH, 2014a: 18). One could infer that the implicit context here is social scientific, as in Belfiore’s preference for language which “describes reality correctly”. The effect is that knowledge is treated as (dark) matter for the creation of cultural texts/objects, as are the media technologies which give form, visibility and motion to that content. The only reference to universities as a source of knowledge is to an absence; the publishing activity of the Heritage Branch is justified as filling a gap not otherwise supplied by academic work. But there is also “culture”, which locates a real disturbance in the Ministry’s thought and in the implications of its responsibilities within the government. One of the fundamental challenges identified by the Ministry in the <i>Performance Improvement Framework</i> reads as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">communities and identities are more dynamic and changing faster than in the past. Culture has become much wider than the arts. The place of culture in society needs to be seen within the broad pattern of the community and as part of everyday life. Its role in shaping the nation has broadened and accelerated. At the same time some of our cultural institutions are still based on 19th Century operating models that focus on large physical institutions and museums. In the future culture will be driven much more directly by the interest of consumers and communities and this will require more rapid adaptation of suppliers and funders of cultural content (MCH, 2014a: 3).</p>
<p class="noindent1">This statement is very important for the way in which it incorporates the whole socpe of the Ministry’s field of action in a set of steps in thought which begin with “culture” in its reference to a mode of knowledge and practice collocated with communities and extending well beyond the arts. In “has become” the process of a state agency’s thinking its way from where it was, in the traditional arts, is signalled and confirmed by the reference to out-of-date institutions, even though Baumol is quoted in the Briefing paper to confirm that progress and media change is not as straightforward in the cultural domain as it might be in the domain of technoscientific production (MCH, 2014b: 36) and it is affirmed in the PIF paper that “New Zealand’s cultural activity is sustained by an infrastructure of tangible and intangible cultural assets built over time” (MCH, 2014a: 6). The statement finishes in the present, with “cultural content” replacing culture and communities paired with consumers. It does not make sense to assume that the Ministry believes that culture will cease to be created by people in communities, and in future will be manufactured (driven) by creative industries; but the statement is an eloquent expression of the force of current official discourses in limiting the ways in which a cultural agency is able to formulate a strong conception of its scope and work founded in culture rather than the (cultural) economy.<sup><a id="note_45" href="#note45">45</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">It is the concept of nationhood which further introduces clear evidence that “the arts” (even as new media arts) and cultural content cannot account for the actual scope of the Ministry’s interests as these are located by the term culture. Besides the reference to the knowledge work of the Heritage Branch, the major commitments of MCH to the government’s interest in national identity include Māori language and culture, the built heritage, the national flag, and national commemorations. One connection among them is the current focus on war history, and another is globalisation and national branding. But there is also another, much more fundamental orientation, which once again opens out on to culture as a foundational term for a society’s accumulated stocks of knowledge. The areas of knowledge which come together in the official concept of nationhood are “New Zealand’s history, heritage and constitutional foundations” (MCH, 2014b: 14). Here, though, a real difficulty arises in the double affirmation that there is an inclusive national identity even while there are now inherent multi-cultural frames of reference, and that cultural production contributes to its formation/maintenance. Just as education in another context gets a mention under the heading of arts education, so it reappears in this context as civics.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is important not to discount the effect of the different audiences for these documents on their composition, but the primary audience is clearly internal to government and it is that relation which defines their orientation, their mode of discourse, and helps explain the apparent inconsistencies in the case they make for the government’s involvement in the cultural sector.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The signs that MCH has made a difference, according to the PIF, include public understanding of the importance of New Zealand culture:</p>
<p class="quote">New Zealand culture is defined by us and defines us. It is the embodiment of the distinctive values, traditions, and beliefs that make being a Kiwi in the 21<sup>st</sup> century unique. While culture is expressed in many ways, it captures the New Zealand character in a distinctive way that others recognise.</p>
<p class="quote">There is recognition that a strong, creative and inclusive culture strengthens our nation and is an essential component to being in charge of our own future; culture is an enabler of creativity, innovation, productivity and wellbeing (MCH, 2014a: 9).</p>
<p class="noindent1">But, what kind of testing do these propositions sustain? An inclusive and hence tolerant <u>society</u> is clearly critical, but “being a Kiwi” is now an on-going project of cultural engagement with cultural differences (and global political, economic and legal forces), in relation to which it is the rule of law which provides the anchor and Parliament the national forum. But innovation as the link term between creativity and productivity offers something quite different, “creative destruction”, which can clearly be as readily produced in the domain of meaning by new art as in the domain of the economy in general by competition in the capitalist free market.<sup><a id="note_46" href="#note46">46</a></sup> In its <i>Strategic Challenges</i> paper, MCH affirmed that</p>
<p class="quote">Cultural expression is fundamental to our well-being and central to a healthy and vibrant democracy. Culture has inherent value in its own right.</p>
<p class="quote">Culture is a mirror. It reflects what is happening in our society and plays a key role in forging our identity as New Zealanders. Culture makes our lives meaningful. Cultural participation offers people and society opportunites for improvement and growth.</p>
<p class="quote">It is also important to recognise that the individual benefits gained through engagement with cultural activity have a ‘spillover effect’ into a public benefit (MCH, 2014c: 4).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Accepting that documents of this kind are composed as a mosaic of positive propositions rather than steps in an argument, the question these paragraphs taken together nonetheless raises is, What integrates these manifold perspectives on culture into a coherent set of policies for culture, as distinct from the special case of the arts as culture? The whole account is potentially turned on its head in the third paragraph when the individual (not the agency) is recognised the active location of the effects of cultural activity and the means by which that activity creates a public benefit. Why not reverse the current emphasis in policy on the economic value of culture, so that it is understood instead to be a “spillover effect” of its fundamental collective function of generating and conserving meaning (cultural knowledge), with each individual as the primary medium of this social process?</p>
<p class="noindent1">There is also the matter of public value. It really matters to find that this conception of how the work of public sector agencies, and most especially those in the cultural sector, may be more appropriately evaluated is present in the documents, but the use of the concept seems to have been overtaken by the official emphasis on economic value. The Ministry states that “The cultural agencies are working together to better understand the public value of cultural goods and services, including their economic and social benefits. This will assist decision-making to maximise public benefit from government investment in the sector” (MCH, 2014b: 29). The thinking about public value and cultural value expressed in several Demos reports from 2005-6<sup><a id="note_47" href="#note47">47</a></sup> provides a useful perspective, since they do not discount the importance of the economic contribution of the sector, in arts, creative industries and in the wider domain of culture as such, but they do offer substantial ways of making sense of a sector in government which exists in a fundamentally different relation to its publics, to knowledge, to the institutions and objects which locate it in the material real, and to society and the economy than do the now economically valuable knowledge sectors of the technosciences, business and the central agencies of government.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Accepting that no public agency can function without both policies and measures against which its work, and that of the organisations and people whose activities it supports, can be assessed, the validity of an economic measure of value as the primary (sole?) measure of value has been challenged by the Demos project. In its place, a concept of cultural value appropriate to the cultural field was formulated and its implications for the self-concept and work of public cultural agencies investigated. As Holden demonstrated in <i>Capturing Cultural Value</i>, to find appropriate concepts which both represent accurately the nature and work of culture in society and economy and can become the means of assessment for the purposes of government and the organisations composing the cultural field, it is necessary to look beyond the current economic value frameworks. Affirming the need for “a new language for culture” (2004: 35) in policy discourse, he stated that “Cultural value is generated and exists in a context: the space in which objects or performances appear, their critical reception and the climate of public and political opinion all affect cultural value” (36). He proposed that relevant concepts for defining it could be found in Anthropology and Environmentalism. Listed without his explanatory commentary, the dimensions of value for culture are:</p>
<p class="quote">from Anthropology: Historial, social, symbolic, aesthetic and spiritual values; and</p>
<p class="quote">from Environmentalism: duty of care, intergenerational equity, fairness of distribution of benefit, the precautionary principle, diversity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is important here to note that these values are general to culture, although they are also specific to the arts. I have no doubt that all of these aspects of culture, and their role in the arts and heritage, are quite familiar to MCH. But the concept of cultural value is itself absent from the Ministry’s published policy papers, and hence an important means for substantiating the larger case for arts, culture and heritage and formulating an integrated policy for the field is missing.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A good reason is to be found in the discursive environment in which cultural policy continues to be formulated. As noted recently in a reflection on the effect of the Demos papers on cultural value, Hewison (2012: 209-210) commented that “two concepts […] have a valid claim on the formation of cultural policy: Value for Money – and Money for Values. […] At the close of 2011, in spite of attempts to produce a nuanced resolution of the differences between these approaches, the Value for Money argument prevails.” At the close of 2014, at least in New Zealand, the same can be said. A key heading in <i>Briefing</i> is “measuring and maximising public value” (MCH, 2014b: 29). I intend to consider the concept of public value in more detail below, but it is important here to acknowledge the presence of this concept in the MCH overview of its work, and its effective co-option to an economic context of application. In several paragraphs setting out the cultural policy research being undertaken, “public value” as a general concept becomes “public benefit”, “the public value of culture”, “the economic value of cultural activity.” The general claim, “Through its refreshed cultural policy research programme, the Ministry is working to become a recognised leader in demonstrating the value of culture in its own right and as a contributor to wider social and economic goals”, understandably collapses into a dominant focus on economic value; “culture in its own right” is supported by the concept of the innate (or inherent or intrinsic) value of culture, which can be easily affirmed by those who believe it to be true but which, as Holden pointed out, “When used as an argument for more funding, or for less restricted funding, ‘inherent value’ can appear as a form of defensiveness by cultural institutions and their leaders; an attempt to assert the value of their own judgement above that of others” (2004: 24). It is also an argument of much less policy value than an argument from economic value. An observation by MCH affirms that</p>
<p class="quote">The portfolio may benefit from incentives, particularly for long-established arts organisations, to focus more on innovation and change, for example, exploring new types of content and different means of delivery which potentially would attract wider audiences and create new revenue streams. (MCH, 2014b: 39)</p>
<p class="noindent1">To turn the statement around would be to demonstrate how the creative industries are just the tip of the cultural iceberg, a new set of options in media and business which may remediate older media and the institutions built in relation to them but can neither supplant them nor become the dominant source of cultural knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Here a policy chasm opens up. Innovation and change in the domain of culture/the arts is linked to increased audiences and new sources of income, whereas innovation and change as “the new” (or avant garde) in culture/the arts would typically be unlikely to have either effect. But, if one emphasises the “means of delivery” then the whole process of repurposing or remediating already existing cultural objects, forms and genres in new media technologies becomes the proxy for innovation. This slippage is also familiar in the sciences, where “the new” is not necessarily (immediately or ever) a marketable product. As Holden observes, “The small, experimental, emergent practices that seem to lie at the margins of current concerns about culture needing to be economically and socially useful are vital for the sustenance of our cultural health” (2004: 38). Holden’s emphasis here on the relation between emergence, margin, and innovation contrasts strongly with way in which creative industries are now located at the heart of cultural policy as economic policy.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.13"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-13">7.5 Creative Industries</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">It is striking that the New Zealand documents to which I have referred in this chapter exclude any discussion of the knowledge embedded in and informing cultural production, as distinct from the forms of cultural expression in the arts and crafts, performance, media and heritage. The absence of any substantive consideration of knowledge in cultural policy (both the knowledge used and the knowledge created) underlines how the term creative industries can appear as apparently one of the same class in national innovation priorities in the early twenty-first century in Aotearoa New Zealand with biotechnology and information technology; it is the implicitly common term industry and the role of scientific and technological knowledge in the development of new media forms and products which determines how it is understood<sup><a id="note_48" href="#note48">48</a></sup>. What might have been the strategy if cultural processes and their distinctive resource base in inherited knowledge and modes of production had been foregrounded instead, and if media culture had been incorporated in the government’s analysis of new knowledge production rather than rendered invisible? A provocative representation of this situation, but one which is entirely consistent with the dispersal of the term culture through the categories employed in documents concerned with knowledge policy, is provided by de Certeau when he writes that “Culture is the battlefield of a new colonialism; it is the colonized of the twentieth century. Contemporary technocracies install whole empires on it, in the same way that European nations occupied disarmed continents in the nineteenth century” (1997: 134). And, one might add, with “terra nullius” replacing the commons as an operational concept facilitating resource exploitation in the virtual as it once did in the physical world.</p>
<p class="noindent1"></p>
<p class="noindent1">The story of the discovery of the cultural or creative industries as a new object of economic policy in the 1990s in the United Kingdom has been thoroughly told.<sup><a id="note_49" href="#note49">49</a></sup> In order to fit the arts under the heading of innovation in knowledge society and economic policies and, reciprocally, to generalise the concept of creativity to all aspects of new product development and marketing, it was necessary to identify a common factor. This was not the work of art in itself, but the new twentieth-century industrial and techno-scientific means by which works of art along with texts of all kinds could be multiplied as copies of themselves or as representations of unique objects and widely distributed through markets for news, entertainment, research and development, lifestyle, and culture. Innovation and economic value were located much more in the new media technologies, especially digital networked media, than in the works themselves.<sup><a id="note_50" href="#note50">50</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">It is clearly not possible to argue for a direct relation between creative industries and innovation by analogy with the concept of the art work, even though the conventional slippage between the art work as the original sign of the presence of creativity and the cultural products of the creative industries is one way of claiming creativity for them. As New Zealand innovation policy has demonstrated, the critical link with innovation claims is technological; it is the new technological forms and media of twentieth-century ICTs in which the innovativeness of creative industries typically resides from a techno-scientific and economic policy perspective. If innovation depended upon unique aesthetic inventions, it would fail completely in policy based on the economic value of such products; creative industries depend on mass markets/multiple copies, or niche (but global) markets prepared to pay a high price for the distinction of ownership.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is nonetheless important to be clear about the primarily imaginative quality of the predominant products of creative industries. They are either fictions in themselves (entertainment in the form of creative, visual and performing arts) or involve fictions (sports spectacles, the money markets, fashion shows, advertising, architecture, celebrity, politics, news). But it is not common to position this wide spectrum of cultural product creation under the term “fiction”. Instead, the body of knowledge and skill which takes its place is classified in general as design or in particular by various forms of genre, performance or authorship (architect, artist, choreographer, composer, designer, dramatist, film-maker, journalist, novelist, photographer, poet, scriptwriter etc). A particular effect of the discovery of the creative industries is to bring the two terms, design and fiction, into direct contact, disturbing the conventional scope of each, because that scope has been used to secure the boundaries of two domains of creative work, namely, that related to industry and technology (systems for the collective or mass production of cultural objects of all kinds), and that related to the modern arts (systems for the production of singular cultural objects), despite the obvious fact that the creation and production of works of art has become increasingly embedded in technological apparatuses, and industrial production has become increasingly influenced by aesthetics.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the concept of creative industries was primarily aimed at making cultural objects countable in economic policy, it nonetheless also highlighted the materiality of aesthetic objects and at least some of the costs associated with their production and circulation, a fact well known to artists but typically sidelined when it was the high culture values of a specific set of those objects, their meaning and significance, their “thought”, which was the object of attention from within the humanities. A double shift is impending here: on the one hand, a reconceptualisation of cultural policy, in which the concept of fiction plays a central role; on the other, a reconceptualization of the humanities, in which the materiality of the medium plays a central role.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.14"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-14">7.6 The Role of the Artist</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">However conformant with the rhetoric of technocratic discourse, the cultural policy documents produced in Australia and New Zealand weave together threads of discordant colours and textures. If the concept of the scientist seems relatively stable in knowledge policy, the same could not be claimed for the concept of the artist. As I noted above, there are many specific titles for those engaged in cultural work of one kind and another, and the once privileged position of the artist has been undermined by the industrialisation of cultural production. For these reasons it is particularly interesting that the 2013 report <i>Creative Australia</i> included a section on the role of the artist, as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">A democratic society seeks to unleash the creativity of all its citizens and to celebrate the extraordinary achievements of its most gifted and dedicated. The value of creativity is something that is increasingly recognised and valued. Creativity is an essential attribute in an increasing number of occupations.</p>
<p class="quote">The most gifted artists, however, take the ability to imagine, adapt, empathise and collaborate to another level through training, practice, discipline and courage. The extraordinary achievements that come when the most gifted individuals combine capacity and skill is something we recognise.</p>
<p class="quote">[…] As with sport, the arts celebrate leadership, skill and brilliance. It also encourages legions of others to engage on their own terms. At the heart of our culture are people reading, writing, drawing, painting, singing, performing, designing, up-loading videos and tweeting—expressing what it is to be human through stories, music, pictures and performance (2013: 40-41).</p>
<p class="noindent1">How, in a small space and few words, to capture the complexity of relations, purposes and forms of evaluation which notions of democracy, the arts and creativity raise when taken together? Creativity is a universal human attribute, but the artist, like any skilled performer, is recognised by success in public and competitive performance in a specific field of achievement. Does the democratic perspective mean that people show that creativity is a human universal by doing it in their own ways, or does “expressing what it is to be human” refer to the contents of their creative acts? What would change in policy thinking if the statement referred to “expressing what it <i>means</i> to be human”? Do these acts exemplify what is glossed as the work of the artist, and do they typically (or only rarely) “generate new ideas and ways of understanding the world” (41)?<sup><a id="note_51" href="#note51">51</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">If “the arts” were to be replaced by “the sciences”, and “the artist” by “the scientist”, nothing in the democratic generosity of the statement and its attribution of creativity to everyone would change. The social spectacle of celebrity and competitive ranking applies across the whole spectrum of knowledge work, especially now between nation states and in the confusions between product branding and identity formation. But, in another context, <i>Creative Australia</i> observes that</p>
<p class="quote">the cultural, social and economic benefits derived from arts and creativity are still not fully recognised politically. This is partly because the activities and modus operandi of the cultural sector is not easy to harness, and its capacity to inspire, innovate and provoke can make those with power wary. It is also because of the lack of sufficiently strong, comprehensive and comparable data about the sector and the economic and public value it creates. (32)</p>
<p class="noindent1">To put the distinction crudely, for science generating new ideas and ways of understanding is progressive, new knowledge replacing old; new ideas now become socially destabilising by means of the churn of competitive innovation in the commercial application of new knowledge, and provide a challenge to regulation, policy and morality in this way. For the arts, the challenge to government is more intimate; just as politicians and political parties build their claims to power on ideas about what it means to be human, so do artists. And, like politicians, artists seek to engage directly with individual minds through beliefs, values and inheritances. The double binds for policy are palpable, and underlined by the knowledge that <i>Creative Nation</i> and <i>Creative Australia</i> were produced by Labour governments, and their recommendations were fated to be substantially ignored or revoked by subsequent Conservative governments<sup><a id="note_52" href="#note52">52</a></sup>. Caust argues that arts and cultural policy in Australia as represented by <i>Creative Nation</i> and <i>Creative Australia</i> moves from a traditional art for art’s sake conception to the economic value to the nation of the arts to a concept of general creativity, noting that there are “certainly some mixed messages in <i>Creative Australia</i> when it tries to connect different aspects of culture” (2015, 177). Her judgment succinctly points to the constraints on cultural policy formation as the term culture separates from the arts and the notion of moral and aesthetic cultivation to offer a potentially different ground for knowledge policy, but a ground which cannot yet be rendered or defined coherently. For policy and administration, perhaps the most succinct expressions of the bind are in the metaphors, unleash and harness, and the double concept of value, economic and public. But at least it was possible to point towards the profound political problem represented by culture and the arts, in which what can be counted – the cultural product in some media form – may also be socially, intellectually, politically and economically subversive in its “new ideas and ways of understanding the world”.<sup><a id="note_53" href="#note53">53</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">As with the New Zealand policy papers, the difficulty of making claims for innovation in respect of knowledge in the cultural sector is apparent, especially when the criterion of economic value is dominant and when “expressing what it is to be human” is a common characteristic. The first outcome of MCH’s cultural policy research programme, <i>Value and culture: An economic framework</i>, is exemplary both for what it does, and what it cannot do.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The paper is a rigorously disciplined investigation, in which the scope of MCH is brought within economics; as the Executive Summary makes clear, “This paper outlines the concept of economic value within a cultural context. Culture is taken here to include all goods, services and activities in the broad arts, sports and heritage space” (7). But it is the concluding paragraph which reaches out towards the Demos analysis of cultural value, and which confirms Holden’s view that cultural policy needs to adopt a new language and assert a different ground than the economic on which to build its self-representation to the public and to government:</p>
<p class="quote">The (potential) failure of some of the economic assumptions suggests that economic valuation techniques, while valuable (and greatly superior to conventional impact analyses), should not be the sole method for determining funding allocations within the cultural sector. Individuals active within the cultural sector have in-depth knowledge about the values generated within their sector and tapping into this knowledge will be likely to improve the value for money from policy interventions within the sector. They will have deeper knowledge about what goods and services are likely to be valued in future, instrumental benefits which may arise from supporting certain goods or services and how best to compare the benefits associated with the variety of cultural goods and services which are on offer today. These more subjective, but in-depth, sector-specific contributions should therefore be used as complements to economic valuation techniques when determining priorities within the cultural sector (Allan et al, 2013: 39).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put another way, one can see better where a spotlight is aimed than in the shadows outside its illumination. The evolution of the scope of cultural policy over the past twenty years, as signified by the Australasian examples I have discussed, points to the grey area which is both in and out of the policy process and is named as culture. The enlargement of scope is a consequence of the dominance of economic discourse in government and business in politics, both totalising forms of thought and social organisation, and new media technologies which, as crucial social infrastructure, have had their potentials largely shaped by economics and business. As Schultz (2013) argued in a paper reflecting on the formation of <i>Creative Australia,</i> cultural policy now has a “whole of government” reference: “Clearly there is a link between the institutional value of culture and foreign affairs, infrastructure, communications, tourism, even defence; the instrumental role intersects with education, health, welfare, community affairs, migration, Indigenous affairs; the industry sector intersects with trade, research, innovation, tourism, infrastructure, communications and so on” (15). It is, however, notorious that the whole of government, like a map of the world or the university’s claim to embrace the whole of knowledge, breaks down into territories walled with varying dgrees of permeability. At the level of thought, if not of practice, what is it about culture that creates interfaces between the departments of state and could become the principal source of authorisation (as the economy is now) for the work of government? The incoherences in cultural policy point to a Kuhnian moment of impending paradigm shift, in which current knowledge is reconceptualised when too many exceptions to the structures formalising that knowledge accumulate, and raise the question of where the tipping point might be such that culture, not as the arts but as the primal scene of knowledge generation, becomes the engine driving cultural policy.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s3.15"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-15">8. Turning (to) Cultural Policy for an Education State</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The preceding discussion of (local) policy documents has demonstrated how policy evolution as a process of reconceptualising a sector or function within government is a space of intersection between concepts circulating globally and local contexts of reception and application. Specifically, the documents reveal that the challenge to the traditional justifications for government involvement in the arts by the creative industries has occurred together with changing conceptions of democracy, the (creative) citizen, the role of media and communications in society, the globalisation of economies and societies, the nature and functions of culture and education. In particular, conceptions of postmodern democratic societies as innovative knowledge societies have not been extended from their normative techno-scientific origin to include an account of the role of knowledge generated by cultural processes. This section will begin to explore what is needed for this situation to be remedied and the “whole of knowledge” to provide the ground for thinking through the problematic of the innovative or knowledge society. It will consider four perspectives on culture and education: the art system, as theorised by Luhmann; the concepts of “culture in the plural” and the local as discussed by de Certeau; the global perspective of UNESCO; and a singular mind in civic engagement.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.16"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-16">8.1 Arts and Culture</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1"><i>Creative Australia</i> recognised that the arts provide a complicated set of challenges for policy making when that is based implicitly and explicitly on the techno-scientific and industrial production of knowledge and objects of economic value. The arts (and the artist) as a now special (but previously the traditional) instance of cultural productivity and creativity remain central to this problematic, as do the humanities. To advance discussion of it in cultural policy requires a theory of the arts which can make sense of what is distinctive about them in postmodernity and is capable of providing an intellectual framework capable of thinking together the diversity of institutions and practices which are described and catalogued in the various policy papers.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There is little point in attempting to overcome the present marginality and incoherence of “the arts, culture and the humanities” in policy for knowledge and innovation by including those parts which are conformable to the current methods of valuation by quantification, technocratic discourse and the application of techno-scientific knowledge, and bracketing the rest. It is more productive to approach the problem by asking what other ways of thinking can discover the coherence of the spectrum of knowledgable work captured by “the arts, culture and the humanities”, and bring them into the frame (by reframing it) of policy thinking.<sup><a id="note_54" href="#note54">54</a></sup> A powerful theory of art which addresses key elements of this problem has been put forward by Niklas Luhmann in his <i>Art as a Social System</i> and I will briefly identify the relevant steps in his argument here before taking up other aspects below, in <a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter Four</a> on communication, and in <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a> on the genesis of the art work.</p>
<p class="noindent1">An art work is a specific instance of what I have called semiotic objects, a class of objects distinguished by being formed in relation to and typically manifesting in some way meanings and values generated over time in the environment (cultural, social and natural) in which they are made. From a perspective in the postmodern, Luhmann argues for a conception of art as an historically evolved functional system of a postmodern society, like the economy, or science, or law, or communication. It is refreshing to begin with a premise, that humanly created objects exist, like given world objects; the intention is not to explain why they exist, but to observe the functions they perform in society as societies change over time. The term art refers, therefore, not just to the objects which from time to time are classified by that term and so distinguished from other kinds of objects, but also to the complex social apparatus which determines the classification of objects, produces interpretation of such objects, makes claims for their value and meaning, trains artists and critics, establishes and maintains institutions for the collection and display of such objects, and enables a diversity of conversations about them by means of the media and education systems.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Luhmann acknowledges at the beginning that “it turned out to be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish the systematics of the system from the bare facts while bracketing historical analyses (as would have been feasible with the economic system, the system of science, and the legal system)” (2000a: 3), and his work persistently approaches the question of the attributes of an art system by identifying critical phases in European art history which mark evolutionary developments in the form of artworks.<sup><a id="note_55" href="#note55">55</a></sup> It is also his concern throughout to show that these phases go together with widespread changes occurring in European society, for example, “art of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries reacted to a new social situation marked by the erosion of a unified religious world-view, a monetary crisis of the nobility, the imposition of order by the territorial state, and the new rationalism of mathematical-empirical science with its geometrical methods”, but a later reaction is subsequently expressed in the important postulate which is further elaborated in the study, that “[modern] art projects a society as yet unable to experience and describe itself adequately” (144-145). Put later in another way, he proposes that “art tests arrangements that are at once fictional and real in order to show society, from a position within society, that things could be done differently” (313); or, in a word, the work of art is a provocation (22).</p>
<p class="noindent1">For Luhmann, all functional social systems in postmodernity develop by autopoesis, that is, recursively from within themselves, and influence other co-existing systems and are influenced by them in a process Luhmann calls “mutual irritability” (2). Throughout his analysis of the art system he confirms the present situation in policy thinking and the organisation of government, that the art system is an outlier to those dominant in official thinking: “Compared to other intersystemic relationships – between law and politics, for example, between the health system and the economy as an employment system, or between the economy and science – the art system is surprisingly isolated” (243). Because his analysis of the characteristics of the art system which make it distinctive from other social systems is precisely elaborated, I will identify them with quotations from rather than by making summaries of his thinking.</p>
<p class="noindent1">He observes that “Art has very few direct effects on other functional systems, and this is why society rarely responds to the differentiation and autonomy of the art system” (181). From another perspective, he asks, “What happens to art if other social domains, such as the economy, politics, or science, establish themselves as functional systems? What happens when they focus more narrowly on a special problem, begin to see everything from this perspective, and eventually close themselves off with an eye toward this problem?” (137). In general terms, the consequence is reductiveness and the foreclosing of possibilities for thought and social action as formulation of the “special problem” assumes a totalising force if its knowledge domain becomes dominant in knowledge politics. Specifically in respect of my argument in this book, the humanities’ exclusion as a means of formulating knowledge of value to society offers an elaborate example of this effect.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Lacking this tendency to a narrow focus is a key factor in the separation of art from other social systems such that “More than any other functional system – religion, politics, science, or law – the art system is able to accept multiple descriptions of complexity. More than any other functional system, it is in a position to demonstrate that modern society and, from its perspective, the world can be described only in poly-contextual terms” (306). Postmodern artworks do not, therefore, deliver truths or descriptions of reality; instead, as a medium of communication, they engage consciousness not with “unambiguous denotative meaning” (25) but with deliberate ambiguity and indeterminacy, creating a situation where “we find ourselves confronted by the hopelessly unending interpretability of ‘finished’ works” (12). This is clearly also the situation of policy work, even if it is not so radically expressed; but the unavailability of this comparison, and hence the exclusion of the art work as a potent source of new knowledge, is a clear sign of the way in which governments “close themselves off” from very important and locally available means for thinking innovatively, for achieving foresight. As Luhmann suggested, “all the problems to be solved in the system of society are directly or indirectly related to the structure of meaning” (139), which is fully realised and encountered in specific manifestations of “culture in the plural”.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Time as history and the framing of experience by history are integral factors in the creation and experience of artworks, but in dynamic and formative ways which quite transcend the more static implications of the current cultural policy term heritage. From this perspective, any art work is new because it recollects but is not bound to repeat previous forms, and its freedom is magnified by “poly-contextuality”. Art is understood by Luhmann to provide the clearest exemplification of a fundamental problem for postmodern societies and the autopoetic systems which constitute them, namely,</p>
<p class="quote">the question of how to relate to the past within a system that has become autonomous, how to mediate between past and future, between memory and the freedom to change sides, in all of the system’s distinctions. […] The art of the past has become history. This precludes the simple repetition of existing works or styles. By losing the self-evidence of its binding force, the art of the past relinquishes its forms and styles as material to be exploited. Museums (and, in a different way, libraries) now serve as a system-internal context against which the new can distinguish itself <i>and which is indispensable for this purpose</i>. […] Even if, under the signature ‘postmodernism,’ insistence on the novelty of the individual work has been replaced by the freedom to combine traditional forms, the self-historicization of art remains bound to the distinction between the new and the old. […] Art exemplifies a situation in which the future, no longer guaranteed by the past, has become unpredictable. Operative closure, the emancipation of contingency, self-organization, poly-contextuality, the hypercomplexity of self-descriptions, or, simpler and less accurately formulated, pluralism, relativism, historicism – all these trends offer no more than different cross sections of the structural fate of modernity. By suffering its own condition, art shows that’s just how it is. (303, 309)</p>
<p class="noindent1">For Luhmann, art provides a strikingly different way by which postmodern societies can begin to comprehend their situation as it is captured by these concepts. Works of art perform these characteristics and create events because association with them takes time and engages the beholder with meaning. But the manner of this engagement is also distinctive. As a new work open to the unpredictability of the future, each art work creates a new imaginative space by creating a real object drawing upon the history of such objects and oriented towards the future, in which what is potential comes into encounter with what is actual in the perception and experience of each beholder.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Even though each artwork is new, like singular minds it exists in a web of communicative dependencies with others like itself: “the artwork […] only comes into being by virtue of recursive networking with other works of art, with widely distributed verbal communications about art, with technically reproducible copies, exhibitions, museums, theatres, buildings, and so forth” (53). Here the full scope of the art system comes clearly into view: “the institutionalization of art and the establishment of supporting information (exhibitions and so on) require that works of art ‘converse’ with one another, that cite, copy, reject, renew, ironize art – that art is reproduced, no matter how, within a referential nexus that transcends the work. Today this is called ‘intertextuality,’ which is another way of saying that the art system must have a memory” (245). I am using the term semiosphere as the most inclusive term for this “referential nexus”, understood as the location of meaning and as ordered by the “simpler” terms “pluralism, relativism, historicism”, and the concept of the I-space to identify its social structural characteristics, comprising both institutions and forms of communication.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Here the complex issue of how art can be innovative, and what it means to refer to creativity as the motive power or source of the possibility of innovation, is made explicit. The art system is isolated in public policy formation (if not simply absent) because its characteristics, evolved as they are now through the constant re-formation of artworks and their interpretation, is rendered invisible to policy as a result of the political claim by the science system and the systems affiliated with it by method and truth procedure to provide the only valid source of (new) knowledge about reality relevant to government and society, and by the industrial and commercial models of production and innovation. A very different conception both of the grounds of decision-making and the kinds of knowledge relevant to understanding the situation of society in relation to its possible futures, and hence of modes of policy making, would result from taking seriously Luhmann’s account of the characteristics of the art system and applying it as a means of opening out government thinking to more than one modality of knowledge creation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The immediate consequence is a claim for the possibility of coherence complementary to science at the level of expert knowledge and hence in policy formation for the cultural sector. Just as an artwork is an object supporting the creation of a diversity of expert knowledges – for example, in art history and philosophy (and the sub-disciplines formed in relation to each media technology involved in the making of artworks), archaeology, design, materials science and techniques of use, medium theory, curatorial theory and practice, arts policy and administration, the art economy – so by extension do all semiotic objects, as the most inclusive term for humanly created objects.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At almost every point in Luhmann’s analysis, there is an incentive to extend his argument beyond art to the humanities, even if the term humanities appears only once in the whole book (212), whereas the term “science” appears many times, and he grants science the status of a system constituted by multiple disciplines but does not propose a similar status for the humanities. This difference indicates that his analytical project is located (with a touch of irony?) within the frame of science: “Science (<i>Wissenschaft</i>), here specifically sociological theory, must open itself to irritation through art. Science must be able to observe what is presented as art. In this basic sense, sociological theory is an empirical science (according to its own description, at any rate)” (7). But many important consequences for thinking about the humanities and cultural policy follow from his analysis, not least as a result of this discursive and methodological commitment to the creation of knowledge and its significance for the claim that cultural policy is the foundational policy of an education state.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This claim has its complement in the claim that the term the humanities signifies a coherent body of expert knowledge, however diverse its disciplinary and institutional components (and they are extremely diverse, such that practitioners in one domain may not now perceive themselves as participating in a more inclusive project of enquiry), and that the grounds of this coherence must be (like an evolving national identity) understood by those professing humanistic knowledge. What Luhmann has demonstrated as the complex components of the art system and how they are held together by their self-description applies equally to any discipline or field of enquiry in the humanities, but especially to the whole, what I am calling the new or postmodern humanities. The new humanities becomes the expert dimension of the system of postmodern culture as that is made up of all the diverse forms of textual production characteristic of a postmodern, democratic society. It is founded on the existence of semiotic objects and their integral relation to their human creators and their beholders, the times, places and societies in which they find themselves at the time of their creation and subsequently, and the energetic sphere of meaning in which they are contained. The ever-changing composition of the semiosphere, and its inclusion of all kinds of textual production from all times and places, in all languages and media forms, is the ground of the vitality of humanistic knowledge and thought and the source of its capacity to engage the future on behalf of humanity. As Luhmann notes, “we must expand the notion of text to include every object in need of interpretation” (98), the textual productions of government being a notable example.<sup><a id="note_56" href="#note56">56</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.17"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-17">8.2 Economy and Culture</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">It seems to be generally agreed that the recent period of drastic reform of New Zealand - socially, governmentally, economically – according to neo-liberal principles has not produced the economic benefits (at least for the majority of the population) which were the proclaimed purpose of the reforms and were to provide the compensation for the stress of structural change. The tensions within the nineteenth century concept of development - in which citizens of a young, recently colonial nation are particularly embedded - between the exploitation of colonised territories for wealth and an inclusive conception of moral, social, intellectual and economic improvement (development as civilising) seem to have been currently if insecurely resolved internationally in favour of a singular focus on wealth-creation under the increasingly thin pretence in Western countries of advancing democracy. Such a resolution, effected by the new imperialism of global financial institutions, places extraordinary pressures upon the governments of democratic nations which continue to accept that their first responsibility is to their citizens. In New Zealand, I would argue that it is the process, instituted in the mid-1970s, of acceptance by the state of responsibility for the effects of colonisation on the indigenous Māori people and the incorporation into New Zealand’s (unwritten) constitution of the Treaty of Waitangi (signed between the Crown and Māori in 1840) as the founding document of modern New Zealand, which has brought into focus the local complexity of a global situation. This act of government, setting in process a crucial and as yet incomplete rebalancing of relations between settler and indigenous peoples, is an exemplary act of cultural policy, one which could only be taken in Aotearoa New Zealand because it is only in the territorial and cultural space occupied by this nation state that such a foundational act can have meaning and purpose, including for new knowledge creation and economic development.<sup><a id="note_57" href="#note57">57</a></sup> The analysis presented in <i>The Heart of the Nation</i> is an example of what it means to bring distinctive local cultural and historical factors to bear on global developments in public policy and institutional formation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have previously referred to de Certeau’s conception of “culture in the plural”, and I will now expand on its implications. The concept was formulated in response to an earlier crisis, the events of May 1968 in France, in a number of essays on the problematic of a cultural policy in which the role of the educational system is a central factor. In his analysis de Certeau sets up two contrasting domains of social action, one which links the institutions of disciplinary knowledge, the state, the media and the economy as aspects of a system owned and run by an elite, in which ideologies, politics and the exercise of power are disguised in a process which he describes as the “scientific and technical rationalization” of society. As with Brier, this domain is not outside of culture, but it is itself a mode of culture, what he terms “culture in the singular”; in research, it is identified in the “unitary interpretation [or] a totalizing vision” produced by investigators who share a “homogeneity of milieu”. He perceives this rationalization to be exemplified by “the neutrality of scientific discourse”, a discourse “held by ‘anybody’ but by no one in particular”, a principal effect of which is to silence and render invisible the diversity of local languages (the relentless production of talk and images by the mass media is argued to have the same effect) and the heterogeneity of social practices which are produced by people in human relationships in specific times and places (1997: 105, 139, 127, 33, 136-7). This other, marginalised domain of social action de Certeau calls “culture in the plural”, and it is on the basis of this distinction that he enquires into the possibility and sources of innovation and creativity in a society entering the global orders of postmodernity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For de Certeau, “culture in the singular has become a political mystification. Furthermore, it is deadly. It menaces creativity itself.” The economy provides another example of what is at stake in this opposition: creativity is a function of “a plurality of cultures, that is, of systems of references and meanings that that are heterogeneous in relation to each other. To the homogenization of economic structures there must be a corresponding diversification of cultural expressions and institutions. The more the economy unifies, the more the culture must be variegated” (1997: 67-68). By moving thought about culture away from works and the “ideology of property” to multiple “systems of references and meanings”, de Certeau points to a fundamental contrast of critical importance to democratic governance in postmoderntiy, which is marked by crises of meanings, not facts or reasons. He formulates a striking axiom: “To innovate is, first of all, to betray oneself” (1998: 6).<sup><a id="note_58" href="#note58">58</a></sup> Beyond meanings there is only a void, “opened up by a society that calls itself into question”; at its most fundamental, a process which “splinter{s] the continuous network of sentences and ideas” holding together a unified conception of society and subjectivity (1998: 5, 42). A potent instance of the co-existence of a unitary conception of society and of its splintering in the lived experience of individuals is to be found in the children of migrants, who he describes as “borderline types [for whom] living at the edge of two worlds, two languages, and two cultures has already trained them for these uncharted voyages between opposing codes and dialects, for multiple operations of translation” (1998: 113). Innovation and creativity in postmodernity are here the product of “uncharted voyages between opposing codes and dialects”, occurring anywhere in society where the plurality of cultures is experienced in practice by persons living in collectivities.</p>
<p class="noindent1"></p>
<p class="noindent1">It is not that public documents in New Zealand lack references to cultural and linguistic differences; the point is rather that, when it comes to innovation and the economy, the dominant voice in public policy discourse is technocratic, a politics of knowledge in which the politics are disguised by “scientific and technical rationalization”. It would also be dominant in formal education, the officially desired link between education, employment and economic development to be made by scientific and technological knowledge. There are obviously critical differences – theoretical, methodological, institutional, practical - between universalist and pluralist conceptions of knowledge; but an innovation theory and policy which is not culturally pluralistic in its fundamentals fails to comprehend the underpinning sources of creative energy and thought in a particular jurisdiction. It is in this context that the concept of nation building, which in recent public policy is aimed at providing a distinctive brand for otherwise similar products and at compensating for the loss of social cohesion generated by the risk economy, assumes a quite different value. Grounded in a conception of “culture in the plural”, innovation policy (and hence economic policy) would become a branch of cultural policy, rather than the other way around. The differences of cultures and languages cannot be cancelled or reduced to a unity (except by force); their productivity lies in the unceasing negotiations, and thinking, which contact between them generates. A society, in the form of a nation-state, provides a framework of conventions and procedures, historically evolved in the territory of that state, for the peaceful conduct of this negotiation, in which the political and juridical organisation of that society at the national level is particularly important in formulating conceptions of national culture as a body of cogent beliefs and practices constituting a dimension (but not the totality) of each citizen’s self-consciousness. It is not the content of these conceptions, but the process by which they are articulated, debated, and modified over time, which the democratic nation-state must guarantee. Becoming a global citizen is now a further possibility of citizenship, but the nation-state persists as the highest level of identity formation which remains intimately constituted by the local specifics of land, place, language, history and cultural practice.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The consequences of thinking in terms of “culture in the plural” can be briefly indicated by de Certeau’s comments on two place-oriented terms which specify contrasting but related dimensions of embodied consciousness. The first is Europe, a term signifying a process of “nation-building”, but in this case a supra-nation. De Certeau notes, first of all, that “In European nations, which in many respects are still traditional societies, the adaptations to technical requirements of labor leave intact or brutally cut through - even if superficially - the deeper structures of affective life and personal frames of reference.” He goes on to identify a “specifically Western tension: everyday life runs directly against the grain of a collective conviction that has been a typically Western structure for more than four centuries, namely, that a connection must exist between productive labor and personal development. […] This tension is especially felt in nations whose space tends to be more closed, whose history is longer, and whose coherence is stronger” (106). These differentiations have been enacted exactly in New Zealand, if not during the same long European time-frame; Māori are identified officially as a traditional society needing help for that reason to adapt to the requirements of technocratic society, and it is usual for Pakeha (normally British or other European settlers) to adopt or to be placed in the position of lacking a traditional culture, so that “traditional” is equated with “indigenous”. But everyday life for Pakeha is similarly now based on a disconnect, since conceptions of New Zealand’s cultural identity and its public institutions have been built from the beginning of European settlement on the premise of the link between “productive labor and personal development” and, more recently, on a post-colonial, bicultural conception signified by the name Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Furthermore, de Certeau argues that “What really characterizes Europe […] are the cultural heteronomies between each of the countries which compose it: a difference of languages, traditions, and histories […] the elucidation of these divergences is the only possible way to discover a ‘European’ specificity” (130). Where these divergences are now the fact of localities and memories within new nations like New Zealand, de Certeau’s point holds true: if, for an education state, postmodern nation-building is a matter of elucidating heteronomies, not prescriptions or unities, then engaging formally and publicly with these divergences, not to rationalise them but to install them as the complex and continuously evolving and negotiated content of the sign “Aotearoa New Zealand”, must be a primary goal. This work is fundamentally educational, whether carried out by the government in policy work, or by the formal education system, or by the media, or by the multitude of forms of association linking people throughout the nation. In Aotearoa New Zealand, the kinds of principles which could be taken as indicating the terms on which this nation and its citizens mutually understand each other are those set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity. The principles identifying an Aotearoa New Zealand specificity among the world’s nations have now been articulated in the Constitution of Aotearoa New Zealand proposed by Sir Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler (Palmer and Butler, 2016: 34-35). It is here, rather than in the economy, that the work of cultural policy establishes the conditions by which innovativeness becomes a decisive characteristic of the national system for social and economic reproduction.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The other term is “local”. As de Certeau notes, “International information does not prevent a group from being <i>locally</i> determined. The universality of information is relativized through a peculiar way of being treated” (129).<sup><a id="note_59" href="#note59">59</a></sup> New Zealand Government documents recognise that most new (scientific and technological) knowledge is created elsewhere and emphasise that the education system must incorporate such universally valid knowledge into New Zealanders’ learning and research, not least because this knowledge is the way into the global economy. But de Certeau points out that “Western economic reason works differently in countries whose sociocultural structures are different from those that, over the past three centuries in Europe, have fostered the growth of technology and science. Surprising combinations among the different systems are sketching out still unknown global hypotheses that might shift the general equilibrium of societies and ways of living and thinking that we have known” (130). Applied to New Zealand, this conception of the local modification of global hypotheses about the purposes and modes of operation of society as the source of innovation requires a much more complex account of the role of cultural history and difference and of modes of knowing other than science and technology. It is also a recognition that policies encouraging the immigration of already educated, skilled people from elsewhere (policies which short-cut the long-term and costly public commitment to educating a nation’s young people), may have much greater local benefits in creating shifts in “ways of living and thinking” that are more likely to derive from the cultural pluralism which they enhance (or disrupt, depending on the cultural politics of the society in which they were brought up and educated) than their specific work-related knowledge. What distinguishes knowledge and innovation which is “made in New Zealand” is not the scientific discovery, the image added to a product, or a dominant western knowledge system maintaining a space for traditional Māori knowledge; it is what de Certeau refers to as “the peculiar way of being treated”, the complex interactivity between inherited and imported knowledge systems in this specific place producing new sociocultural forms and new possibilities for knowledge creation, as envisaged in the Kahikatea scenario of the Foresight project.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bevir (2010) offers another conception, which elaborates de Certeau’s concept of “culture in the plural” and provides a further demonstration of the value of approaching issues of creativity and innovation from a localist rather than a universalist perspective. He writes that “Reasoning is always local in that it occurs in the context of agents’ existing webs of belief. […] To insist on the local nature of reasoning is thus to preclude an autonomous and universal concept of reasoning and subjectivity associated with much economic theorizing” (261-262). He distinguishes between local reasoning and local knowledge, the former involving a web of beliefs which is not spatially delimited, the latter involving knowledge created from embodied experience in a specific time and place. In this account expert knowledge is as much subject to local reasoning as is local knowledge, a position also affirmed in de Certeau’s conception of the relativising of universal knowledge. A third distinction connects the concept of innovation and the creation of new knowledge and practice to the most general ground for innovation explored by H G Barnett, human creativity and the cultural inventory on which it depends. As Bevir writes, “Local reasoning operates through a capacity for creative if situated agency. Agency is creative in that there is no rule defining how people will modify their prior beliefs to make room for a newcomer. […] Situated agents engage in local reasoning whenever they accommodate a new belief in an existing web of beliefs” (263). This interpretation of the situatedness of knowledge and its creation, which includes tacit as well as expert and universal knowledge within its scope, like de Certeau’s concept of culture in the plural, opens the door on to the proper consideration of the grounds of innovation in the interactivity of cultures and histories in local contexts. And now, because the infinitely many localities on the planet can re-present themselves in other places culturally through migration and virtually through global media as communities of difference within a nation-state, they have become prime sources of the mental energy for changes in thinking, both socially creative and socially destructive.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.18"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-18">8.3 UNESCO</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The international, governmental organisation most directly engaged with what it means to make education the ground on which the work and value of knowledge are conceived generally and specifically for innovation is UNESCO. As the locus of what Miller and Yudice (2002: 169) call “global cultural policy” , its mission, structure, processes and history highlight the extraordinary complexities of trying to develop collective thinking about education, culture, human rights and the principles of good governance while keeping the diversity of languages, cultures and histories (including colonisation, war and the economic sources of conflict between and within nation states) in the foreground.</p>
<p class="noindent1">UNESCO’s programmes and strategic themes offer an approach to globalisation which emphasises the interactivity of multiple cultures, histories, and languages within and among nation states. Its emphasis on local difference acted out locally and communally in education, social practices and cultural creativity stands starkly opposed to the universalism of economic globalisation, which nonetheless cannot be ignored. Economic development is placed within a framework of ethical and sustainable practices, in which life-long education, heritage and inherited knowledge play crucial roles.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a recent publication, <i>Culture in the Post-2015 Development Agenda</i>, Alfredo Pérez de Armiñán, Assistant Deputy General, Culture Sector, UNESCO, has written that “Culture has an enormous potential to generate dialogue among members of society, to strengthen civil society and to promote democratic life, while encouraging the exercise of freedom, tolerance, understanding, peace and reconciliation” (2015: 7). It can “play a decisive role” in sustainable development, in “poverty eradication, quality education, sustainable environmental management, sustainable cities and social cohesion and inclusion” (5 ). But it is important to note the conditionals in this statement, reflecting the conclusions of a Culture and Development meeting among 18 states in 2014 which stressed the importance of including culture in the development agenda, implying that such an inclusion was not yet certain.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the context of a different theme, “Protecting our heritage and fostering creativity”, heritage and creativity are presented on the UNESCO website as a priori conditions for social and economic development: “Heritage constitutes a source of identity and cohesion for communities disrupted by bewildering change and economic instability. Creativity contributes to building open, inclusive and pluralistic societies. Both heritage and creativity lay the foundations for vibrant, innovative and prosperous knowledge societies.”<sup><a id="note_60" href="#note60">60</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">These propositions now figure in much cultural and educational policy in democratic societies, to the point of seeming self-evident. But actually trying to work out their implications for state insitutions and public policy is a much harder task, and UNESCO is one of the few institutional formations available with experience of the complexities of trying to think outwards from a foundation in cultural and educational policy which respects “culture in the plural”. The difficult consequences of adopting this position are clearly marked in UNESCO’s own history, which parallels the on-going disempowerment of humanities knowledge in Western democracies.<sup><a id="note_61" href="#note61">61</a></sup> For this reason it is striking that the current Director-General, Irina Bokova, has recently proposed that UNESCO should give form to a new humanism, which she has defined as the means of refocusing the UNESCO mission for the twenty-first century. Her conception has been elaborated in a variety of meetings, the substance of which has been published in 2014 as <i>Envisioning a New Humanism for the 21st Century</i>.<sup><a id="note_62" href="#note62">62</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">In one expression of it (UNESCO, 2014: 36) she writes that</p>
<p class="quote">We need today a New Humanism rooted in a profound respect for human dignity, fundamental rights and the diversity of cultures. We need a new vision of development where every woman and man feels a sense of responsibility towards others and for the safeguarding of our planet.[…] We must ensure our social intelligence lives up to our scientific intelligence – to prevent conflicts, to eradicate poverty, to release the potential of every woman and man. From across the world, we hear appeals for more imagination, for greater justice and solidarity, for a new harmony with our world. This is not a philosophical debate – it is a policy issue.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The work to be performed by a new humanism is transformative, by changing minds through education and dialogue - as humanism has always sought to do, and which is the mode of work in the world of humanistic knowledge. It becomes a policy issue because enacting the principles involved is the responsibility of states and institutions as well as persons, and because it is only by understanding and enacting the principles individually and collectively that beneficial and sustainable change is possible. As Prof Delmas-Marty observed,</p>
<p class="noindent1">‘Rather than repeatedly affirming principles, we need to try to reverse the movement towards dehumanization in reality” (2014: 58).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The key to this reversal is education, but of a kind not currently the centre of educational policy in regimes operating under neoliberalism. A good summary of what is at stake is given by Bokova in an address to the University of Malaya in 2013 (2014: 17):</p>
<p class="quote">Education policy is the ultimate long-term policy – it must be visionary, it must be strategic. I believe we need to rethink the fundamentals of education at this time when the world is changing profoundly. We need to educate for a sustainable future. […] The future agenda must start with equity – to ensure everyone can exercise the right to education, to training, to learning opportunities. […] It must promote global citizenship – to strengthen peace and human rights education and shape new behaviours for sustainability, and to give cultural literacy that is so much needed. This requires a sharper focus on education for creativity, education for global solidarity, education for sustainable development.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Contributors to the various reports of meetings are also very clear that it is not possible to affirm the importance of dialogue, education or culture without engaging with the capacities and limitations of the internet as a new, global communications medium. If there is a kind of universalism in this technology, there is also a kind of universalism characteristic of the new humanism. A meeting organised by the Russian Centre for Science and Culture in 2012 succinctly contrasted the scope of now traditional humanism which remains powerfully informative of thought and practice in the Western humanities, with that of the new humanism:</p>
<p class="quote">While classical humanism sought to reconcile tradition with modernity, as well as the rights of individual with their duties as members of communities, the New Humanism will have to help reconcile the local with the global, and people with nature. A global awareness of life and a sense of compassion for people and nature must be acquired by each and every one.</p>
<p class="quote">The universalism intrinsic to humanism is not static and inflexible. Rather, it is an evolving idea which different generations and nations adapt to their circumstances at a given point in time. No culture holds the monopoly to truth, justice, or universality, since all traditions, cultures and religions contain a humanist kernel. In this sense, humanism is not an ideology or a dogma, but an invitation to dialogue among equals. (UNESCO, 2014: 29)</p>
<p class="noindent1">In respect of my concerns, this is a very timely intervention into the problematic relations between knowledge, values, and power (political, social and economic) in a globalising world order, and a significant challenge to technocratic policy formation which brackets ethics, cultural histories and values as forms of knowledge outside its rational and objective scope. But this new humanism also confronts the modern Western humanities by omission with a profound challenge. What counts as modern knowledge in UNESCO thinking is the modern western sciences and social sciences; but their practitioners enjoy a freedom not available in research as such to employ their expertise in the UNESCO context in the service of humane values and social development. Culture in the sense of ways of thinking is typically associated with traditional and indigenous knowledge, which is displaced and superseded by modern knowledge or repurposed in new media technologies (but is conserved as heritage). The modern Western humanities, as literate traditional knowledge (principally European but including the texts of other cultures as these entered European awareness), fit neither category, which creates (for me) the ironical situation that the organisation which I would wish to regard as the international location of the work of the postmodern humanities and a working model, however imperfect, of the education state, envisages a New Humanism without proposing a New Humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There is one notable exception in this publication which is highly relevant to the case I have made for the humanities in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a>, and which captures the whole reason for this chapter. Homi Bhabha (2014: 71-72), in a concluding response to Bokova’s acceptance speech at the beginning of her second term as Director-General in 2013, observed that</p>
<p class="quote">It is difficult to conceive of a flourishing of new humanism if the map of knowledge is itself deeply distorted. This age of the world-wide web is, in some ways, a narrow, parochial place. According to reliable sources, the US and the UK published more indexed journals than the rest of the world. There are remarkably more articles (7,800) written about Antarctica than any country in Africa or South America.</p>
<p class="quote">In this map of ‘educational un-sustainability’ the humanistic disciplines are in a state of crisis. How can the new humanism take root if the soil of humanistic thought is left to wither? What is neglected in this era of Big Data is the remarkable integrative capabilities of the humanities. The integrative capability of the humanities has given rise to a number of hybrid disciplines – the digital humanities; the medical humanities; the legal humanities. Notice how such interdisciplinary formations display the extension of the humanities into areas of public policy and social ethics. Notice, too, how the ‘integrative’ impulse of the humanities is structured along the lines of inclusion and diversity, so that ‘public reason’ is accessible across all divisions. From this perspective, it becomes clear that the integrative humanities, in the company of scientific discoveries, can be preeminent in contributing to building a global civil society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is an open question, from which direction has the motive for integrative thinking and practice come, and what are the resources within the disciplines of the modern humanities for initiating integrative thinking and understanding, not only across disciplines in a university environment but across the borders of discourse and purpose between institutions, especially those involved with learning and governing. What are the forms of “public reason” as the common factor in all kinds of humanistic knowledge as they are disseminated through all the communication networks of a postmodern democratic society? How should “public reason” be manifested in the work of the public sector of a postmodern democratic nation-state? The contemporary politics of knowledge are powerful and a prime source of the crisis to which Bhabha refers; they also explain why the promotion of a new humanism has recently become the mission of UNESCO as a supranational organisation founded on universally applicable ideas about what it means to be human which challenge neoliberal and autocratic settlements in policy, economy and law, put pressure on forming goals for social action leading to human betterment, and remain open to interpretation now in any culture, place and jurisdiction, and always open to the future.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s3.19"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-19">8.4 A singular mind, publicly engaged</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Another working example of the kinds of relation between knowledges and practices which would be distinctive of a new humanism and the cultural policy of an education state is the project <i>Imagining America: Artists and Scholars in Public Life</i>. Its mission, as defined on its website, is “[to create] democratic spaces to foster and advance publicly engaged scholarship that draws on arts, humanities, and design. We catalyze change in campus practices, structures, and policies that enables artists and scholars to thrive and contribute to community action and revitalization.”<sup><a id="note_63" href="#note63">63</a></sup> Established in 1999, it is a “national consortium of over ninety colleges, universities, and community-based cultural and arts organizations. It was born out of efforts to strengthen the significance of the cultural disciplines in both academic and civic life” (Peters and Eatman, 2014: 168). It is founded on a positive critique of the separation between academic work and the public value of knowledge and experience shared in civic and communal settings, and in collaborative projects with democratic renewal as a major goal. It proposes a revised conception of the civic responsibilities of academic training in the arts and humanities, in which what has been typically known as community service in New Zealand but is here defined as civic engagement is understood to be integral to professional identity and academic work. Its purpose is to connect higher education, theory and practice with local populations across the boundaries of art forms and disciplines, performance spaces and the communities in which they are located, based on the conviction that social and personal development begins with people in their local communities. Knowledge and expertise which are internationally informed and nationally recognised must also be communicated and disseminated by practitioners in the local urban and rural settings in which artists and academics live and work. Cooper (2014: 161) describes this as “cultural work in the public interest”, a conception of the ways in which knowledge in the arts and humanities needs to move and have effects in the world. Two of the values espoused by <i>Imagining America</i> identify what motivates and gives form to this cultural work:</p>
<p class="quote">Critical and pluralistic approaches to ways of knowing about the world and acting in it;<br/>Creativity and innovation in developing and mobilizing theory and knowledge with communities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">These values are intended to position academic professionals at the interfaces between their expert knowledge and public applications of it, in many different social settings requiring the kind of rhetorical and discursive adaptability with which I began this chapter and with the expectation that learning is mutual and reciprocal.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The publication in which Peters’ and Eatman’s assessment of what is at stake in this revisioning of the purposes and uses of academic knowledge in arts and humanities is a collection of essays by David Cooper which reflect on his diverse roles as an academic in the humanities, writing instructor, editor, and proponent of change in the conception of professionalism in the cultural disciplines. The title of the collection, <i>Learning in the Plural</i>, happily echoes de Certeau’s “culture in the plural”; the plural for Cooper, who describes himself as a “teaching humanist devoted to learning in community and community in learning”(2014: xx), refers to his experimenting with and applying a variety of engaged learning techniques focussed on civic engagement, the practice of public humanities scholarship, and reshaping the teaching mission of the humanities. As a kind of intellectual biography and statement of faith, the essays collected in <i>Learning in the Plural</i> are unashamedly positioned against the current form of professionalism in the humanities, which he describes in one place as producing “hyperspecialized scholarship [which] is completely unintelligible to a literate public” (161). In their Afterword, Peters and Eatman qualify this account while supporting the principles on which it is based, in the process elaborating on the work of <i>Imagining America</i> and how that work of cultural and professional change might be advanced. They state that “It’s not easy for academic humanists to speak and work in critically hopeful terms, to constructively, productively, and imaginatively connect and integrate hope and critique, and to do so off their campuses with diverse publics. Such work runs against the grain of academic culture” (170-171). But such work, grounded in the most advanced, theoretically sophisticated textual analysis, intellectually and rhetorically respectful of singular minds, diverse audiences and communities of endeavour, engaged in discovering the meanings and effects in local contexts of globally ranging enquiry, attentive to and participant in the manifold conversation of democratic societies, skilled in applying the power of media forms to shape public knowledge and cultural change, is the work required of the practitioners of a new humanities.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s3.20"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s3-20">9. Conclusion</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The singular professional life of a humanist which is documented in Cooper’s essays reveals a person of principle and conviction adapting to local circumstance and institutional change and evolving through learning and action the meaning of what he has come to know and believe, both about the humanities and the democratic society in which humanistic knowledge is of fundamental importance. A succinct summary of his conception of a humanist’s professional identity is given by the question which defines the relation of the public scholar to knowledge and the world: “How can the practices, methods and conventions of my disciplinary scholarship yield knowledge that contributes to public problem-solving and public creation?” (155). For Cooper, it is the failure to ask this question (or to provide answers through public action) which more than anything else accounts for the absence of the humanities from participation in discussions in the United States about nationally important issues like the future of higher education, citizenship, the public good and renewal of democracy. It is a question which, like the new humanism proposed by the Director General of UNESCO, and the values and mission of <i>Imagining America</i>, point clearly towards constitutive features of a new humanities and the cultural policies of an education state.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But there is a more fundamental issue. As this chapter has argued, a new humanities capable of engaging fully and deeply with the processes of thought and action by which a society’s possible futures come into existence requires a new settlement in democratic societies about the nature and purposes of knowledge creation. In particular, it requires that the tentative moves in cultural and educational policy away from fixation on the economy and the technosciences and towards the foundational roles of culture, the arts, life-long learning, innate human creativity, and a democratic conception of social and political relations should be vigorously advanced. In one respect, the evolution of the art system as analysed by Luhmann has captured cultural policy, whatever other non-industrial activities, like sport, have been added to the responsibilities of cultural ministries. It is, however, striking that little account in current cultural policy is given of the value (socially and economically) of the knowledge generated culturally and artisticly, as distinct from the knowledge required to produce art works, manage art enterprises, and use media technologies, especially digital networked technologies. This absence is consistent with the absence of the humanities from cultural policy and it succinctly locates many of the obstacles to claims for the value of arts and culture as sources of innovative knowledge, in contrast to the technosciences. Cultural policy, and therefore the humanities, can be repositioned only by shifting the ground of cultural policy thinking away from its now traditional preoccupations with art forms and modern cultural institutions and towards integration in policy and public sector institutional formation of the field of cultural knowledge creation. A theory of the arts and the humanities as together a fundamental source, like the sciences, of innovative knowledge of value must lie at the core of such an integration. The concept of the education state framed by cultural policy is integral to this transformation of the work of government and of the humanities.</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note15" href="#note_15">15</a></sup> Two startlingly different analyses of the significance of the knowledge worker are provided by Florida (2002) and Andrew Ross (2000). For Florida, the new ‘creative class’ is transforming society and the economy: its core includes ‘people in science and engineering, architecture and design, education, arts, music and entertainment, whose economic function is to create new ideas, new technology and/or new creative content. . . [They] share a common creative ethos that values creativity, individuality, difference and merit. . . [The creative class] is dominant in terms of wealth and income” (8-9). Ross agrees that “a new labor landscape” is being drawn and that those who provide its model workers do share an ethos of the kind described by Florida. He argues that “the artisan-jazzman shares the same position and predicament as the professional academic whose labor has been degraded and deprofessionalized in recent years. What are the economic circumstances that have accelerated this degradation? . . . artistic and academic traditions extol sacrificial concepts of mental or cultural labor that are increasingly vital to newly important sectors of the knowledge industries. No longer on the margins of society, in Bohemia or the Ivory Tower, they are providing a rationale for the latest model of labor exploitation in core sectors of the new industrial order, and pioneering the workplace of tomorrow.” This workplace requires a worker who is “comfortable in an ever-changing environment that demands creative shifts in communication with different kinds of clients and partners; attitudinally geared towards production that requires long, and often unsocial, hours; and accustomed, in the sundry exercise of their mental labor, to a contingent, rather than a fixed, routine of self-application” (28, 2, 11). A useful critique (including a self-critique) of Florida’s work can be found in UNDP and UNESCO (2013: 20-21).</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note17" href="#note_17">17</a></sup> Lasn (2012: n.p.) includes a vivid visualisation contrasting neoclassical and ecological paradigms of economic thinking, which makes this point at a glance. Rancière (2006: 96) describes democracy as “the action that constantly wrests the monopoly of public life from oligarchic governments, and the omnipotence over lives from the power of wealth. It is the power that, today, more than ever, has to struggle against the confusion of these powers, rolled into one and the same law of domination.”</p>

She identifies the unspecified non-citizen in this regime as a person who is characterised by “non-mastery of basic knowledge required for the full exercise of plural national citizenship”. A perfect example of the challenge to societies claiming to be democratic is the high correlation between illiteracy and imprisonment, a predominant mode of non-citizenship.</p>

Its concluding paragraph observes: “In 1998 the goal of greater co-ordination of cultural policy, foreseen before the establishment of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, remains to be accomplished. The fragmented nature of its involvement in the sector has discouraged government from undertaking any overall assessment of cultural policy, whether from an economic or any other perspective. Such an assessment is necessary if government is to address the successes and failure of its historical role and develop a coherent set of priorities, objectives and structures for its involvement in the cultural sector” (40).</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note36" href="#note_36">36</a></sup> Users of the methodology were advised to use “the knowledge you have now to look imaginatively, but plausibly, into the future” (25). The collective authorial perspective on society was understandably from a position in business.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note37" href="#note_37">37</a></sup> Hayles (2012: 175-183) explores the differences between databases and narratives as modes of organising and representing knowledge. In sum, “ The flip side of narrative’s inability to tell the story is the proliferation of narratives as they transform to accommodate new data and to probe what lies beyond the exponentially expanding infosphere. No longer singular, narratives remain the necessary others to database’s ontology, the perspectives that invest the formal logic of database operations with human meanings and gesture toward the unknown hovering beyond the brink of what can be classified and enumerated” (183). See also Hassan etal, (2007: 68): “But recently storytelling has been embraced and championed as the must-have tool in a wide range of fields, from savvy businesses to efficient medical practices. The rising stock of stories can be seen as a part of the shift away from the focus on logical, linear, computer-like capabilities and the metaphor of the machine as an agent of change. Instead there has been a growing interest in issues of meaning, values, ambiguity, fluidity and non-linear notions of thinking which give centre stage to subjectivity and context” (Hassan et al. 2007: 68). But power remains vested in abstraction, stories providing officials with a means of distracting attention from this fact while apparently demonstrating how organisations are responsive to and aware of individuals.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note38" href="#note_38">38</a></sup> A more recent version of narrative applied to thinking about the future, but not prioritising any type of knowledge or organisation, was employed in the Dreaming City enquiry: “The concept of futures literacy is based on the premise that by enabling people to create and consider a range of alternative futures in a safe but challenging way, we can get ourselves ‘unstuck’ from the assumptions we hold about the present and find the confidence to act in the here and now. […] It is about democratising the present and the future through opening up authorship and assumptions about what kinds of futures are possible, probable and preferred” (Hassan et al, 2007: 80).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note39" href="#note_39">39</a></sup> See Milburn (2002: 266): “the scientific achievements of nanotechnology have been and will continue to be extraordinarily significant; but, without contradiction, nanotechnology is thoroughly science-fictional in imaginig its own future, and the future of the world, as the product of scientific advances that have not yet occurred.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note40" href="#note_40">40</a></sup> A very succinct statement of the view that science leads and culture (if it is properly constituted) follows and supports is given in the rubric to a 2002 conference, Being Human: Science, Culture and Fear, which was presented by the Royal Society of New Zealand in association with The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and the Stout Research Centre for New Zealand Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. The rubric affirmed that “As humans we have the capacity to transform the world. Science is one way we do this. Culture is how we understand what we have done. When science and culture move apart, fear and uncertainty enter the gap.”</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note46" href="#note_46">46</a></sup> Baumol (2002: 136-138) opens his analysis of creative destruction and innovation by drawing an analogy between warfare and competition in a free market as creators of innovation, although he typically notes that actual warfare is socially and economically destructive. He argues that the growth record of capitalist economies can be largely explained by five elements: “oligopolistic competition that uses innovation as a weapon and engages in an innovation arms race, that routinizes the innovation arms race to reduce its uncertainties, and that engages in systematic innovation exchange and licensing for profit” (142). The problem for the New Zealand government of trying to apply innovation policies to a small economy based on small business is obvious, but the government still keeps trying. It would be more interesting in the domain of cultural policy to follow up the implications of a footnote reference to Baumol in MCH (2014b: 36), which points out that organisations like orchestras cannot have conventional efficiency requirements imposed on them.</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note48" href="#note_48">48</a></sup> A good example of an evolving policy discourse is the Tertiary Education Commission’s Tertiary Education Strategy 2002/7, which can be read together with the innovation reports of 2000-2001. Of the then three national innovation priorities, reference to biotechnology or information technology is unproblematic. But the third term “creative industries” clearly poses a problem. Unlike the other terms, it is not used as such in TES, but phrasings like the following seem to take its place: “creative skills” underpin new industries (11); “a nation [with] a unique, complex, enduring identity” provides a focus for “creative knowledge industries and business” (12); “the areas Government has identified as critical to continued economic development, such as biotechnology, ICT and the creative disciplines” (49). This uncertainty is symptomatic of the knowledge paradigm on which innovation policy is based. A useful assessment of the issues raised by the shift from “cultural” to “creative” industries is made by Cunningham who notes that, at the time of writing, “creative industries are effectively being invented as a concept and a policy instrument” (2002: 55).</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note51" href="#note_51">51</a></sup> De Certeau repositions this question when he asks, “What group has the right to define in the place of others what must have meaning for them? Surely culture is more than ever, in the hands of power, the means of granting, now as before shrouded under a “human meaning,” a form of state reason. […] But is it possible otherwise to maintain that, in the last resort, the meaning of existence is identical to the many shapes that the risk of being human really requires? That is a signifying practice, a meaningful practice. It consists not in receiving, but in positing the act by which each individual marks what others furnish for the needs of living and thinking” (1997: 67).</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note53" href="#note_53">53</a></sup> The 2011 submission of the Australian Academy of the Humanities to the National Cultural Policy Discussion Paper made many of the points which concern me in this chapter. It is therefore worth noting that the final report, Creative Australia, includes only two references to the humanities, one in the context of curriculum content in education (41) and the other to the Australian Foundation for Culture &amp; Humanities, the latter being the most perfect symptom of the problem now for the humanities of achieving official recognition; the organisation was abolished and replaced by the Australian Business Arts Foundation (59).

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note55" href="#note_55">55</a></sup> The most complete history supporting his account is to be found in Chapter 7, Self Description, which is an analysis of the “conceptual history” (261) or evolution of the autonomy of the art system, although each chapter includes historical considerations.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note56" href="#note_56">56</a></sup> Wallace, for example, analyses policy and planning texts and procedures to identify “the temporal prsuppositions built into the design of tools and mechanisms for forecasting and shaping the future” (2011: 6).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note57" href="#note_57">57</a></sup> Whitmarsh argues in respect of relations between Rome and its peripheries that it “is not the dominance of either local culture or the Roman hub, but the significance of the act of transition, or translation, between the two” (12) which should be emphasised.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note58" href="#note_58">58</a></sup> His axiom is helpfully interpreted later when de Certeau states of a society that “this entire totality has to allow everyone to exist, to be different in his or her very relation with others, to be able to create (and to become other than oneself) in a collaboration defined as an inventive process” (1998: 46; emphasis in the original).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note59" href="#note_59">59</a></sup> Whitmarsh (2010: 3) makes a similar point with a different emphasis: “local identities are not static, ‘authentic’, immured against change, but in constant dialogue with the translocal.” The humanities should be critical participants in this dialogue, as translators, interpreters, and analysts of the texts it produces.</p>
