<p class="noindent1">“this flowery crop of knowledge and new light sprung up and yet springing up daily in this City” (Milton, 1974: 240)</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bringing cultural policy into the foreground and locating it at the heart of government brings the multiple, the heterogeneous and the political into the foreground, in contrast to the present where it is the technoscientific mode of universal rationality and quantification distinctive to valuing knowledge in Western democracies which frames the knowledge work of government. I have argued in the previous chapter for the opening out of cultural policy as the framing policy for an education state. A claim which provides a proper perspective for this broadening of conception also locates key ideas and metaphors integral to the case I am building for a new humanities. In a 2001 UNESCO report Mayor and Bindé (2001: 293) represent the information society as a complex cultural construct, human collectivities building metaphorical cities from the materials of the semiosphere:</p>
<p class="quote">At the close of the twentieth century the world is swimming in culture: it has both too much and not enough. Since the information society is building, far beyond all our concrete towns, ‘cross-border, invisible towns’ that extend through the whole planet, it seems to be putting into practice the dream of the blind Argentinian genius, Jorge Luis Borges: it is transforming the world into an infinite and immaterial library, which cannot be assimilated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Quite clearly this world is not the given world of material reality, even though each interacts profoundly with the other. The challenge to cultural policy rests in the “too much and not enough” conundrum, in a situation where the total of knowledge created by humanity over time continues to expand at extraordinary rates while increasing heterogeneity and defeating any attempts at assimilation to a specific ideology or methodology. It also defines the challenge to the humanities as the system of knowledge creation most directly implicated in this transformation, and capable of giving form to constellations of meaning which are potential in the semiosphere and which, in turn, can give form to the metaphorical cities being built from the circulation of information.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s4.1"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s2-1">1. Widening the aperture of cultural policy</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">For Douzinas and Shoemaker, writing respectively from the United Kingdom and the United States of America and positioned in the law, the term Humanities is a neologism datable to the late nineteenth century, generally defined “negatively, in <i>opposition</i> to some other mode of enquiry – as not barbarous, not scholastic, not technical”, (Shoemaker, 2010: 522); they are “as much the product of pedagogical and disciplinary concerns of American educationalists as of the Classics and Renaissance humanistic tradition” (Douzinas, 2010: 51). Like the term Māori which meant people until Europeans arrived and required a generic name for this non-European ethnic group (and the term Pakeha which Maori invented for the same reason), so “the humanities” only came into existence when the role and standing of the domains of traditional European academic learning were “othered”, as indigenous peoples were othered during colonisation, by the new knowledge formation of science and technology. In the latter part of the twentieth century it became the business of non-governmental organisations representing the humanities (rather than academics in universities) to reframe this othering by articulating core values of the academic humanities in new policy contexts.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One of the consequences of the meetings between the various Anglo-American humanities organisations which began in 1996 was that they encouraged the thought that there could be a new set of possibilities for the humanities in public policy formation. The countries were linked by their (variously different) histories of development out of and then various degrees of separation from the United Kingdom, and more immediately by their responses to economic globalisation. But the measuring and grouping of nations on economic criteria had the effect of suppressing almost everything which carried value in a humanistic assessment of relations between individuals, nations and cultures. The meetings raised the question whether a common theme, a shared reactivity to the dominance of an economic model of society which further emphasised the marginality of the knowledge work of the humanities in official thinking, also pointed the way towards a shared proactivity in cultural policy. What should be the principal terms of a cultural policy written from a position in a new humanities? Would those terms be sufficiently powerful to permit developing economic policy from within cultural policy and to position the humanities as a body of public knowledge and expertise relevant to the core concerns of a democratic state?</p>
<p class="noindent">The apparent answer would be No, even though the publications of the various national humanities organisations during the period of the most aggressive implementation of neoliberal economic and social policies directly confronted the implications of these policies. In the process they demonstrated that a new humanities was in formation which extended in its forms of knowledge and practice beyond the current academic disciplines in order to engage with problems in public policy and which included new disciplines like Cultural and Media Studies and, more recently, Digital Humanities. In Milton’s terms there were many “pens and heads there, sitting by their studious lamps, musing, searching, revolving new notions and idea’s [sic]” (1974: 237), and the breadth of these enquiries is captured locally for New Zealand in the journal <i>Media Information Australia/Media International Australia</i> and the programme of Symposia and the subsequent publication of papers of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. I will instance here just four titles:</p>
<p class="quote1"><i>Beyond the Disciplines. The New Humanities</i>, ed K. K. Ruthven. Australian Academy for the Humanities Occasional Paper No.13 (Canberra, 1991).</p>
<p class="quote1"><i>Our Cultural Heritage,</i> ed John Bigelow, Australian Academy for the Humanities Occasional Paper No.20 (Canberra, 1998).</p>

<p class="quote1"><i>Challenging (the) Humanities,</i> ed. Tony Bennett. Australian Academy for the Humanities (Canberra, 2013)</p>
<p class="indent1">Looking at the full list reveals a consistency of focus and a determination to modify official conceptions of knowledge by the insertion of the humanities into public discourse. The same can be observed in the representational work carried out by the American Council of Learned Societies with related organisations, notably the Cyberinfrastructure Initiative, <i>Our Cultural Commonwealth</i>, and with the Association of American Universities, <i>Reinvigorating the Humanities</i>: by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, <i>Alternative Wor[l]ds: The Humanities in 2010</i>; by the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences, <i>Renewing Scholarly Associations: Knowledge Networks for the Next Generation</i>; by the British Academy in <i>‘That full complement of riches’: the contributions of the arts, humanities and social sciences to the nation’s wealth</i>, <i>Punching our weight: the humanities and social sciences in public policy making,</i> and <i>Prospering Wisely: How the humanities and social sciences enrich our lives</i>; by the Arts and Humanities Research Board. <i>The Arts and Humanities: Understanding the Research Landscape</i>; and by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, Bakhshi et al, <i>Arts and Humanities Research and Innovation</i>, Crossick and Kaszynska, <i>Understanding the value of arts &amp; culture: The AHRC Cultural Value Project</i>, and <i>The Human World: The Arts and Humanities in our Times.</i> A further notable grouping was the 10 essay collections on cultural relations published by the British Council to mark their 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2004, among which were <i>Cultural diversity</i> and <i>Do human rights travel?</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There are many more reports, submissions and events from these organisations which have sought to shift the centre of gravity of government policy making away from the economy in these democratic societies. Together, they mark out a new terrain for the humanities, but one which, in profoundly changed discursive terms, was also the focus of the critical humanists of the Reformation who employed the foundational texts of Western culture against cemented and traditional interpretations of them and the social and political order those interpretations supported. As with the present, the crucial public intervention of humanist expertise and knowledge was in thought, textually; to modify society (and especially the distribution of power) democratically, minds need to be changed through a public conversation which acknowledges all the differences of culture and history which now inform conceptions of the social future and the good life in postmodern societies. The simpler route, as neoliberalism has so powerfully demonstrated, is to change the minds of educated and powerful elites, and let their control of the financial, legal, police, media and political systems do the rest. This view is succinctly and uncompromisingly expressed by Wolfgang Streeck (2014: 46) when he observes that “The utopian ideal of present-day crisis management is to complete, with political means, the already far-advanced depoliticization of the economy; anchored in reorganized nation-states under the control of international governmental and financial diplomacy insulated from democratic participation, with a population that would have learned, over years of hegemonic re-education, to regard the distributional outcomes of free markets as fair, or at least without alternative.” As Streeck so precisely observes in the term hegemonic re-education, the crucial (and soft power) means to the end of political control by social elites in democratic societies is educational through all the media available to shape public thinking and understanding, and not only the formal education system even though it remains the principal arena for contest over the purposes of formal education.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is worth emphasising that the process by which such substantive changes occur in society, if not by coercion and state violence, is first and foremost disseminative and educative, whether the changes are effected by an elite (as in Streeck’s example) or by citizen action for change (as Castells has documented). Either way, democratic social change is founded in new understandings of self and society by individual citizens, achieved by participation in some of the many discourses circulating in society and by individual decision-making about meanings, values, and goals. It is important to underline the fact that such participation may involve decisions of a socially and politically conservative kind; substantive social change is not necessarily progressive, as the past three decades testify. An excellent example, and a clear reason why innovation in culture cannot be counted in the way that innovation in economic production can be, is the decision by many people following the 2015 shootings in South Carolina to cease to give public endorsement to the display of the Confederate flag. To make the point in the words of a <i>Dominion Post</i> editorial, “Politicians around the South have moved to drop it, large retailers have stopped selling it, and statues of southern heroes have been put away. It’s a mysterious business, what finally makes social change happen. What seemed impossible for years can suddenly look inevitable. It’s as if there’s a tipping point, where certain people change their mind, legitimising a shift, and then many more jump on board” (27.6.2015: C4). I would argue that the mysterious part of the business is located in the processes whereby individuals change their thinking about some aspect of themselves and their society; it is only when that has occurred that specific events can condense individual changes in understanding into collective action “legitimising a shift” (whether by popular pressure or political leadership) in public practice. The processes involved are humanistic and cultural, both in the kinds of knowledge needed for social innovation and the environments in which knowledge circulates and is interpreted into individual and collective world views. One momentary instance of this process is not just the content of the editorial, but its function as a medium for the interpretation (translation) of this off-shore event into a New Zealand context. It makes a point of critical importance to the evolution of society in New Zealand, that racism is a stain on any democratic society and the actions in the United States are “a <i>lesson</i> to all people about how to confront a history of violence” (my italics). The troubling fact is just how long it takes those with legislative and political authority to act for the good of the polity and not only for those interest groups with political and financial power. Democratic governance should be oriented in the name of all the people towards the potentials of the future, which means in part to lead by comprehending more of the always evolving meanings of “democracy to-come”. It is in this work that cultural policy assumes its full character and most complex functions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As I have argued in the discussion of cultural policy in <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter Three</a>, bringing it closer to what currently matters by demonstrating and calculating the economic value of cultural activity locks cultural policy into the same reductiveness in respect of understanding society that economic policy itself imposes. The fact that the term culture exists in those official documents as a term which will not simply conform to that reduction is a sign that culture is present in all domains of human activity and that social (re)formation, innovation and adaptation is generative of and requires knowledge quite exceeding the current dominant economistic discourse in Western governments. Culture, from this perspective, is the name for the whole of knowledge as it is given form and purpose in a particular jurisdiction or community. And, as the recurrence of the term political in the preceding paragraphs indicates, that whole of knowledge necessarily includes political values and ideologically shaped modes of thought. For this reason, cultural policy in the domain of the arts has to accept, and make overt, the inherent fact of contested values and ideas with which art works will engage their readers. Correspondingly, so do public institutions in which such works are exhibited, not least because exhibitions constitute new contexts (social, cultural, political) for the works they display and therefore new possibilities for the communication or discovery of meaning. In his investigation of the politics of art exhibitions, Luke examines how “cultural mythologies and political power are expressed in the showing of art works by museums” and asks “how particular displays of art works can be seen as political texts rife with conflicted rhetoric about the ideologies of the present. Art exhibitions in the last analysis are elaborate and expensive works of educational theatre with their own special rhetorical agendas and peculiar political teachings.” Luke explores through his analyses of specific exhibitions, and notably those concerned with representations of the American West, how art exhibitions “can create new currents of social, political, economic, and cultural meaning” (1992: 1, 2).</p>
<p class="noindent1">An example of cultural innovation which offers a succinct entry into the excess of culture which I am arguing should matter profoundly to the work of government is an exhibition of photographs created by Calum Colvin, <i>Ossian. Fragments of Ancient Poetry/ Oisein. Bloighean de Sheann Bardarchd</i> (2003), held in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh.<sup><a id="note1" href="#note_1">1</a></sup> The photographs were large scale compositions of fragments of architectural, verbal, inscribed, domestic and media objects, and images of famous Scottish poets transformed digitally through superimposition, lit to emphasise ruin and loss of order and meaning by drawing upon a visitor’s repertoire of symbolic imagery (or, in Bartlett’s terms, a visitor’s cultural inventory). Understanding the meanings of what was displayed was the work to be done by any reader of the photographic images, which are not self-explanatory; one instance of this work is the bilingual catalogue essay by Tom Holland. But for me (by chance being in Edinburgh at the time), a detail drew me into Colvin’s thought as expressed in the images which might not have literally caught the eye of many other visitors. A torn piece of paper lay amongst the dust and rubble in a number of the photographs; it was a picture of the tattooed head of a Māori man. Right from that moment of connection, I began a reading of the exhibition which linked the poetic culture and traditions of Scotland (Gaelic and Scots) to New Zealand and both to the shared post-colonial world of economic globalisation, the fragmenting of individual and national identity and the marginalising of poetry as the most powerful shaper of thought and origin of culture.<sup><a id="note2" href="#note_2">2</a></sup> Returned to now (as I can do through both the print copy of the Catalogue and by revisiting Colvin’s website), what could the exhibition be said to have done then or to be doing now? As the editorialist noted above, “it’s a mysterious business”, not least because the Scots were a major component of the British settler colonisers of New Zealand. Did the exhibition so affect Scottish readers of it that their thinking about its implications led to the momentous change little more than a decade later whereby the Scottish Nationalist Party took almost all of the Scottish seats in the Parliament at Westminster? Has it been recollected since the exhibition closed, since it can be viewed (differently) on Colvin’s website? What effects has it had in the many localities in which it has been subsequently exhibited? Of course, the answers to these questions have to be infinitely more complex and various than understanding the purpose of one man’s thinking expressed in an art exhibition. But this location of singular thought is an event in this social and political transformation, as it is also an interpretive response to and condensation of deep currents of thought and feeling in Scottish culture; and in these ways it contributes to the articulation of a national conversation about the future of Scotland. To make this claim is also to identify the impossible complexity of the movement of events and thoughts in a population which can condense at a moment like an election and which “legitimises the shift” in cultural relations in the United Kingdom away from the settlement between England and Scotland in the Acts of Union in 1707. And the catalogue essay is a fine instance of the interpretive work carried on by the humanities in the form of the occasional essay, making the art work a means to knowledge through the provision of an informed (but also singular, not definitive) reading of the artist’s shaping of perception and understanding through the skilled interplay of media forms, resonant imagery, and references to literate (Scottish) culture. Unlike innovation as new product development in a commercial environment, its effects cannot be measured and its value as an innovation in cultural thought may take generations to be recognised, if at all. But like the singularity of the mind which authored it, <i>Ossian</i> constitutes a singular event which continues to exist in its textual record and in the memories and conversation of those familiar with it. It continues to make other ideas accessible, other thinking, other events, possible.</p>
<p class="noindent1">What kind of innovation policy would a democratic government need if this exhibition were to be taken, not as a model instance of creativity in a conventional cultural policy context, but as a model instance of innovation in the cultural (knowledge) policy of an education state? The exhibition itself is a monetised product, literally in the case of the catalogue but also if a charge were to be imposed on entry to the exhibition. In this respect, it would be accommodated within current cultural economy policy through measures of attendance numbers, catalogue sales, copies of exhibition objects, and so on. But as contributors to economic growth, the arts present an unusual problem, which is placed in the foreground of a report by the Warwick Commission on the Future of Cultural Value, <i>Enriching Britain: Culture, Creativity and Growth</i> (2015). While all products require some knowledge about their functions and qualities on the part of a consumer (“wanting” a product is a cognitive as well as a self-defining and an affective process, as automated profiling of consumers based on purchasing histories demonstrates), the creative arts present a distinctive obstacle; they require higher levels of education for their enjoyment, use and sale. Consequently, an unequal society drastically reduces the economic contribution of the arts because the population pool from which consumers can be drawn is very limited. As the Foreword states succinctly, ‘This is bad for business and bad for society” (8), a point expanded on later by arguing that it is a mistake to think that under-representation of minorities and low income groups is “purely a social justice issue” (21). It is also a life-time matter; government must ensure that “all children up to the age of 16 receive a cultural education in order to ensure their life-long engagement and enjoyment as audiences and creators” (49). Presumably, this is not the kind of cultural education most children gain from their life experience.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Right at the core of this report is a critical intersection of perspectives on cculture. From a national perspective on research into participation in the arts, culture and heritage, “Children born into low-income families with low levels of educational qualifications are the least likely to: be employed and succeed in the Cultural and Creative Industries; engage with and appreciate the arts, culture and heritage in the curriculum; experience culture as part of their home education and have parents who value and identify with publicly funded arts and heritage” (47). But in the very next sentence, the perspective shifts from culture as art produced by experts trained to high levels of technical accomplishment and aesthetic perception and consumers educated to appreciate and enjoy such artistic work; instead, culture as local inheritance shaping identity and the possibilities of experience is invoked: “This is not to suggest that these same children do not enjoy rich cultural lives and experiences, rather the goal is to ensure that those creative and cultural experiences and capabilities that are increasingly being limited to the wealthiest and least representative groups are also made available to all” (47). The strongest and most succinct statement of this egalitarian position is the concept of universal entitlements: to a rich cultural and expressive life (14); to a broad and balanced education that develops a wide range of ctreative professional pathways and an active cultural life (44); to arts and culture because they are “the foundation for developing the imagination, forms of cultural expression, and quality of life that are essentail for human development and well-being” (44); to a fused STEM + Arts curriculum, because “policymakers are obsessed with a siloed subject-based curriculum and early specialisation in Arts or Science disciplines that ignores and obscures discussion around the future need for all children to enjoy an education that encourages creativity, making and enterprise across the curriculum” (45) and because it is “exposure to the multi-disciplinary mix of science, technology, arts, humanities and enterprise that underpins creative success in the UK” (48); to graduate-level cultural and creative education (46); to vocational and work-place training (46).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The report demonstrates how completely orientation to the economy defines the presentation of its analysis, hardly surprising because it has to be addressed to a government which frames every aspect of policy formation in economic terms, and because public funding remains integral to the sustaining of the sector (Holden, 2007). A brief list of key issues identified in the report would be: economic importance of the cultural and creative industries as a sector of the economy; the importance of digital technologies and/in creativity; inequality; inadequate curricula in education and training; cultural education, or lack of it, determines cultural consumption patterns over a life-time; recognising the value to Britain of being a multi-cultural society; interactivity between the various components of the cultural sector, including internationally; focussing on cities and regions with low participation rates in cultural activities; the need for new sources of funding from private sector investors.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But what if all of this evidence were to be formulated into a cultural policy argument which began with the principle of equal access to learning, accepted that establishing and maintaining this principle and the institutions (educational and memorative) providing for it over time was a public responsibility at all levels of government in a democratic society? How else could the meaning of the statement in the Foreword - that “equal access for everyone to a rich cultural education and the opportunity to live a creative life [… should be] a universal human right” – be accomplished? I will quote a longer section from the report as a clear instance of the effects of limiting the implications of a line of thought by conceding the current discourse dominating Western governments:</p>
<p class="quote">Within the Cultural and Creative Industries, sub-sectors such as Music, Performing and Visual Arts, Film and TV, and Museums, Libraries and Galleries are significant employers and contribute to the UK’s reputation as a world leader in standards of cultural production and, more widely, to making the UK attractive internationally to tourists, students and investors.</p>
<p class="quote">These sub-sectors have also traditionally relied on public investment to survive and flourish. In a time of austerity and diminishing public resources, it is important to stress the interdependence of the economically successful parts of the creative industries with these publicly supported sub-sectors. The Commission is particularly keen to raise awareness of the extent to which the success of the Cultural and Creative Industries as a whole is dependent on the talent development, R&amp;D, networks and career opportunities that have been supported by public investment.</p>
<p class="quote">In this context, the proportion of public spending on the arts, culture and heritage is infinitesimal compared to their GVA [Gross Value Added] and their contribution to the economic success of the broader Cultural and Creative Industries. The direct spend on arts, culture, museums and libraries, for instance, is only around 0.3% of the total public spend.</p>
<p class="quote">It is therefore a grave mistake to think that any further reductions in levels of public investment will only affect the reach and impact of the arts, culture and heritage. They will also impact negatively on the quality and diversity of the content and talent that is the wellspring of the UK’s Cultural and Creative Industries Ecosystem. (20)</p>
<p class="noindent1">These paragraphs affirm that sustaining the fundamentals of culture, the knowledges composing it in any time and place, the processes for acquiring cultural learning and expertise and their life-time extension, the institutions which hold the accumulated resources of a society’s knowledge and make those resources universally available, is a public responsibility, and it is only when that responsibility is fully exercised that the specifically economic contribution of cultural production of all kinds can be developed. The term wellspring<sup><a id="note3" href="#note_3">3</a></sup> is an excellent metaphor for this foundational position of culture in social evolution, conveying the view that the economy depends for its capacity to function on the pre-existence of collectively accumulated knowledge and the innate creativity of all people, just as it depends on the resources of the given world (which are only priced when power over access to them is appropriated). Another version of the metaphor is used later in the report, where the nationally distributed Cultural and Creative Industries Ecosystem is said to be sustained by a “broader ecology” (67) of local arts, culture and heritage. In this context, in which the locality – its governance, community development, arts and cultural heritage, access to employment and so on – is in every way dominated by national institutions and London as the capital city, the report argues for nothing less than “a mindset shift across our entire cultural and creative infrastructure that recognizes their responsibility to be more responsive to the needs of particular places and communities” (67). But as the report demonstrates at all the points where it looks beyond the economic framing of culture to larger contexts of explanation, this mindset shift is not limited to the cultural and creative sector. By taking history and inheritance, locality, human potential, social inequality, and culture as foundational factors in social and economic development, the report locates an outside to conventional policy formation even as it accepts that to argue for change requires the argument to be framed in economic terms. It is striking that the case for mitigating the inherited and increasing inequalities for life and opportunity in the United Kingdom is to be made by showing how their perpetuation limits economic growth and, in particular, the development of the Cultural and Creative Industries, defined as an ecosystem. As the Commission affirms, “A successful economy and a healthy, creative, open and vibrant democratic society depend heavily on this flourishing Ecosystem. It is a condition for individual creativity, identity, expression and freedom. The Ecosystem is a superconductor of creative talent and ideas that benefit our society and enrich Britain socially and economically” (9). To think of this social ecosystem as a necessary condition for both a fully democratic society and its economy is to think in terms much broader, more principled, and more sensitive to local cultural actualities than that allowed to cultural policy as an arts policy and as a subset of a national economic policy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is indubitable that innovation in the comprehension of ourselves and our place in the given world is critical to humanity’s survival. From this perspective, innovation is altogether to do with human adaptability, which renders product innovation a special case of a much more general phenomenon. But this is a drastically different issue from innovation as the means by which business corporations survive competition among themselves, a forced process deriving from the demands of capital and creating needs rather than responding to them. It would be quite a spectator sport, if it were possible to stand outside and watch the behemoths struggle to the death; but they implicate everyone in their struggles for dominance while robbing populations of their sovereignty by subverting the public representational functions of the parliamentary system. For all these reasons, to seek to transform the discourse of the state by engaging a new humanities with it requires reconceptualising the state as an education state and its core policy domain as cultural policy, from which all other policy domains would be derivative. This claim obviously turns on its head the current status quo.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But the current status quo in the conduct of democratic states, by being founded in the concept and practice of the market, offers a drastically curtailed account of the social life world which it is the responsibility of government in such states to nurture on behalf of and in conversation with their publics. An example is the dismantling of the public governance of key infrastructure, especially telecommunications, energy, transport and social and health services, and their transfer to the private sector, with the double effect of transforming citizens capable of setting the rules, defining the purposes to be served and determining the price of such systems into consumers subject to commercial power, in-house decision-making based on calculations of market advantage and the profit motive rather than public value, and of appropriating public wealth to private uses. At stake is a well-known and simple substitution: for the diversity of human cultures and political governance deriving its legitimation from collective deliberation and agreements achieved by open and agreed means substitute Western corporate culture, the self-interest of the financial sector, and the atomistic and abstract governance of the market.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Just as the humanities, and cultural policy, are marginal to the market and to its social dynamics, so are the citizens of a democratic state. To assert, therefore, that such a state is founded in the citizen subject of the state in communication with other citizen subjects through a publicly governed infrastructure of institutions and technologies is to challenge the fundamentals of the neoliberal settlement in national and global governance. Considering the embeddedness of the citizen in culture, in contrast to the embeddedness of the consumer in the market, exemplifies the greater diversity of bodies of knowledge informing personal action in culture. This is emphatically the case when it is considered that a democratic society is a cultural and not an economic construct, there being many possible and actual economies as well as social and political formations within any specific democratic society. Because of this diversity of potentials, a fundamental role of a democratic state in acting in the collective interests of its publics is to delineate the multiple possible pathways into the future for that society, pathways which are culturally, historically, environmentally, legally and politically informed, and socially enacted in a process of on-going public discussion and citizen action. From a citizen perspective, the concepts making a democratic society possible are not originally economic, although versions of them reappear in the society of the market. Concepts of equality, justice and freedom produce in their interaction complex conceptions of the relation between citizens and others, citizens and the law, citizens and the state and other states, and of the uses and social management of the power created by organised collectivities of people and large accumulations of knowledge and wealth. Citizen sovereignty and political sovereignty are both undermined when the lowest common denominators of money and market power are able to determine the conduct and evolution of democratic societies.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s4.2"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-2">2. Parameters of/for a new Cultural Policy</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Cultures are gatherings of diverse kinds of knowledge by groups of people over time which are governed by sets of values and practices for their proper formation, interpretation and use; postmodern democratic cultures include science as one of their modes, the values informing scientific knowledge formation and practice being part of the larger set of values interacting in such cultures, just as they include the arts, economics, religion, law and other domains of expert and public knowledge. For a postmodern democratic state to be competently governed, the actual composition of its cultural foundations needs to be fully understood by those who would seek to govern it on behalf of its citizen members. It is fundamental to my argument that, however globally engaged and interpenetrated a democratic nation state may be, its foundations are still local to the territory of that state and the history of its human occupation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make this claim at a time of religious extremism and intensified ethnic nationalism would seem to be fatal to my argument. But it is in just such a time that this claim needs to be placed at the heart of policy formation in democratic states, because it is only in relation to that history that the commitment of a nation-state’s citizens can be focused on the difficult and highly contestatory discussion of its future and the principles in relation to which that future can come into being. But this search for the forms of the future is the fundamental and political task of an open and consultative, representative government, out of which decisions about the management and direction of a society in all its aspects, and not only its economy, can be made. The reverse process, now dominant, defines the future of all states and their citizens in terms of the self-validating conceptions of a global new-style aristocracy. Undeniably, those conceptions also constitute a culture, but one which is a “culture of the singular” founded in the abstract space and time of global finance and universal resource exploitation and detached from the generative, public and local ground of diverse histories of value and belief, where people have to be governed by consent if they are to live together sociably. The outcome of not founding postmodern government on “culture in the plural” is the cycle of violence typically leading to autocratic control of nation-states sustained by military power, abuse of the law, control of the media, and suppression of human rights (and, as a corollary, terrorism). A powerful statement of these relations was given by Zaid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in his address on 20 June 2018 to the 37<sup>th</sup> session of the Human Rights Council, when he focussed his powerfully critical report on</p>
<p class="quote">the deepest, core issue […] the most destructive force to imperil the world has been chauvinistic nationalism – when raised to feral extremes by self-serving, callous leaders, and amplified by mass ideologies which themselves repress freedom. The UN was conceived in order to prevent its rebirth. Chauvinistic nationalism is the polar opposite of the UN, its very antonym and enemy. So why are we so submissive to its return? Why are we in the UN so silent?</p>
<p class="quote">The UN’s <i>raison d’être</i> is the protection of peace, rights, justice and social progress. Its operating principle is therefore equally clear: only by pursuing the opposite to nationalism – only when States all work for each other, for everyone, for all people, for the human rights of all people – can peace be attainable.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A postmodern society is unequivocally a knowledge society, but one in which innovation needs to be understood as a cultural process driven by the energies of singular citizen minds and based in learning of all kinds, and not just in the current conventional kinds (summarised in the acronym STEM) seen from the perspective of business and the economy to be necessary for innovation. So, my argument affirms that cultural policy, as the foundational framework for innovation policy as knowledge policy, must find its primary terms of reference in the situation of the singular mind (which is not a solitary mind intellectually) as the fundamental source of innovative thinking. This singular mind is a universal attribute of humanity, and is not limited to the special case of the genius as the source of innovation or the techno-sciences as the knowledge base for innovation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">What, then, could the main co-ordinates for the cultural policy of an education state be, when conceived of as establishing the terms of engagement by which the conditions for innovation in and of a democratic knowledge society could be sustained effectively by its government? The anchoring principle must be that knowledge informing cultural policy, and therefore all policies of a nation-state, should be <u>humanistically</u> formulated because the whole work of democratic government is to advance the understanding and social practice of “democracy to-come”, which applies to the economy as much as to any other dimension of social action (but perhaps even more, given the force of money power as it is focussed in and through the economy). Scientific and technological rationality is extraordinarily productive of knowledge in its sphere, but as a “culture in the singular” it conceals the contest of values and beliefs endemic to the context of application of that knowledge to human uses. Exposing and facilitating that contest, and negotiating its terms on any specific issue of social regulation and development, is the task of politics and Parliament, the burden of the public sector, and one purpose of humanistic enquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This account assumes an inclusive conception of knowledge (such as Brier’s, or Stehr’s concept of objectified knowledge) regarding the specific totality of knowledge which fills any local context as constituting the culture of that locality. Because the margin between that specific totality and the totality of the semiosphere is highly permeable (if not maintained by strict censorship or other controls over access to knowledge and surveillance of its use, including self-censorship), the possibilities for innovation in thought are in principle extraordinary. Obviously, the current conventional distinction between traditional and modern breaks down to the extent that all knowledge becomes simultaneously accessible and interactive, and diverse rather than unitary principles for deciding truth value become accepted; and so does the distinction between the arts and sciences, on the terms of which the work of art has provided the exemplary case for conventional cultural policy claims to contribute to innovation. Luhmann’s delineation of the art system discussed in <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter Three</a>, and his account of the genesis of the work of art which will be taken up in <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a>, offer a quite different way of conceiving this aspect of cultural policy. Furthermore, since innovation is a social process, the degree of access to knowledge and to the means of disseminating thought, the degree of openness of institutions to thinking differently, the capacity of the system of government to re-think its relation to the democratic principles on which its work is founded, and the priorities adopted for the allocation of a nation’s wealth, all influence the extent to which new thinking can exercise any deliberate influence on a society’s evolution. And the most important common factor is the multiple sets of cultural values which bind individuals into communicative relations with others and inflect thought with its local history and its possible futures in that place. These propositions point towards the issues which a cultural policy must resolve, always temporarily, by providing negotiated formulations assisting a people to make sense of their present and its possible futures. The resource question for a cultural policy is, What resources are needed for innovative thinking as a public and not a special interest activity? This is not only a financial matter, although no aspect of the answer at the level of government will be free of financial requirements. It can be approached by a more general question, <i>What general public conditions need to be established which will facilitate innovation?</i> This question, which shifts cultural policy and knowledge policy from the arts and the technosciences respectively to the general factors enabling public creativity in all fields, opens out onto the fundamentals of access to knowledge and the ability to communicate what one has come to know to others.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One perspective on this constitutive problem, how both public policy and a new humanities should be conceptually framed in order to undertake this revisioning of policy and practice in democratic governments, is offered by a modified heuristic from a research report, O’Brien, Opie and Wallace, (2000), <i>Knowledge, Innovation and Creativity: Designing a Knowledge Society for a Small, Democratic Country</i>, which sought to illustrate succinctly the key elements characterising a knowledge society as a distinctive early twenty-first century (postmodern) social and cultural formation. This heuristic also provides a cognitive map of the attributes intrinsic to formal education and cultural policy for a society oriented towards adaptive change (innovation)<sup><a id="note4" href="#note_4">4</a></sup>, and structural themes which would inform the work of a new humanities.</p>

<p class="noindent1">This heuristic owes a great deal to Gibbons et als’ analyses discussed in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a>; it must also be apparent that it challenges the conventional ordering of humanities knowledge in academic discipline formations, and the ways in which that knowledge can circulate in the world. Taken together these attributes make possible properly complex thinking about the conditions required to establish and maintain the knowledge society as a postmodern <b>social</b> construction in which knowledgeable people interact productively with each other through various media and social systems in a variety of physical and organisational settings, including markets and work. The fundamental requirements for productive interaction are shared cultural knowledge and a common language (2000: 6). It is to state the obvious that many of these attributes can be found in non-state (criminal and revolutionary) as well as legitimate state and non-governmental organisations, in so far as they have adapted to postmodern conditions, and that they are particularly significant in the understanding of postmodern city formations.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is significant that we talk of knowledge policy, but we do not talk of meaning policy; or of a knowledge society, but not a meaning society. And yet, we find our humanity in our meanings much more than in our knowledge, because knowledge, value, belief, self-concepts and our embodied presence in the world interact in situated thought and are productive of meanings which are manifested in decision-making and social action. Meanings, like knowledge, circulate collectively and are modified in dissemination; but they are also much more fully inflected by the singularity of the minds which give form to them and the local specifics of time, place and culture than are the formal knowledge resources of a society. A phrase like “the meaning of knowledge” makes this point clearly; knowledge as such is always subject to interpretation and valuation, which is also a means of its adaptation in and to a specific cultural context. It is through meanings that tendencies in the present become available to consciousness, and the possible (and impossible) forms of the future and the not-yet known can be apprehended (as with the example of Ossian). Without a coherent approach to the cultivation of new meaning, which is grounded in the specific situation of specific cultures, including their lineage and their orientation towards the future, it will be impossible to achieve the condition of innovativeness which has become the aim of public policy formation for postmodern knowledge societies. Present policy thinking substitutes techno-science and business and their specific cultural imperatives for the more challenging effort of focussing an innovation policy on nurturing the seed beds of emergent thought in the distinctive cultural environment of a nation state like Aotearoa New Zealand. To write this is not to deny that technological change is a very powerful and dynamic factor within the broader compass of cultural change, but it must be emphasised that it is not technologies as such which create change; they have agency as prosthetics (or machinic texts incorporating written instructions for their use) which participate in social action and change in ways conceived and enacted by their human users, which are notoriously divergent from the uses conceived by their designers.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s4.3"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-3">3. Thinking towards a new humanities in a new cultural policy</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">My analysis in <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter Three</a> sought to show that official documents concerning cultural policy produced in Australasia from the 1990s to the present demonstrate a process of cracking open an inherited set of conceptions without resolving the consequences into a new synthesis. The boundaries of the field named by the phrase “cultural policy” with its emphasis on the canonical works of European art, music, literature and theatre and the new creative work building on and modifying those traditions in the present have shifted to accommodate new factors, notably media evolution and the economic valuation of the arts, culture and heritage as dimensions of economic policy, as in</p>
<p class="noindent1">Mass media<br/>New (digital) media<br/>Indigenous arts<br/>Economic value of arts and heritage<br/>Fashion and design<br/>Arts, heritage and national identity<br/>Arts, heritage and urban and regional (re)development<br/>Creativity and innovation</p>
<p class="noindent1">The decisive shift in these boundary changes for cultural policy is from the capacity of the traditional European arts to enlighten by pleasurably entertaining to the economic value of art works, like craft works, as commodities in a (global) market (still pleasurably entertaining, but to highly segmented groups of consumers) and then to the economic value of all kinds of inheritance – landscape, nature as wilderness, the remnants of past lives and places – experienced touristically as signs of human sameness and difference, a source of possible learning but not for that reason valued in economic policy. The reciprocal of these boundary changes for policy making in the domain of culture is the challenge to traditional discipline boundaries in the academic humanities and the advent of a new humanities able to speak through new media to the diversity of publics, and especially to the agencies of government, in a postmodern democratic nation-state enmeshed in global flows of knowledge, power and money.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As I have noted, <i>Creative Nation</i>’s publication at the moment of inception of HUMANZ was exciting in what it brought together under cultural policy, and inciting from a perspective in the humanities the question, just exactly what this collocation of interests, histories, institutions and creative and communicational technologies and practices had to do with the modern humanities. In particular, it focussed a problem which had existed from the 1970s in my university, the unstable relation between the traditional, print-based humanities and the academic study of non-print media, in theatre, then film and art history, then television and digital technologies in communications studies, and then mass media - journalism, television, popular music, video games – in media studies, and digital media in fashion and architecture in the School of Design. The relationship was unstable precisely because the increasing diversity of media forms, the social, economic, intellectual and creative energies they focussed and released, and the role of the social sciences in their analysis evolved disciplinary formats which in effect located the dominant traditional humanities as the past of this new present. By contrast, the humanities typically positioned manuscript and print media as normative in relation to which non-print media were secondary to or simply disconnected from their sphere of interest. Creative work in any medium was to be learned and practised in other places. In one respect, this elaboration of domains (media form-based disciplines) simply acknowledges the rapid expansion in the twentieth century of the semiosphere; but it clearly does not, as is the case in government as well, automatically provide a comprehensive framework of concepts which would allow a modern disposition of media forms and disciplines in the field of cultural production to be reconstituted as postmodern humanities. In Australia, a vigorous academic engagement with all of the complexities manifested by such epistemic change and concerned especially with the relation between the humanities and government provided a powerful and on-going source of encouragement and insight to those of us developing HUMANZ. I will instance three examples, which in effect demonstrate how the 1990s were a watershed in cultural policy development in Australasia. An issue of <i>Meanjin</i> in 1992, <i>Culture, Policy and Beyond,</i> captures much of the stress (intellectual, political and social) induced in the academic evolution of Cultural Studies by the claims made for Cultural Policy Studies in the context of changes in the relation between government agencies and the sources of knowledge to which they had recourse. Put another way, if humanists were to re-assert that part of their early modern role of advisers to the state, what formation (subjective, discursive, professional) could that role now require for its adequate performance? If this issue of <i>Meanjin</i> condensed out the importance of and the conflicts in this new engagement between academic critical thought and the uses of knowledge concerning the arts and culture in and by government, it was followed in 1994 by an issue of <i>Media Information Australia</i> (No 73) on “The Policy Moment”, published in the context of the development of <i>Creative Nation.</i> A key issue in the academic debates over the relation between intellectual cultural work and its (re)formulation as policy was neatly visualised by the cover image of the paradisal moment when Eve hands Adam the apple of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The issue was not only how intellectual and critical work could be applied to public policy formation, but there were multiple discursive mismatches between:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the quantitative and bureaucratic orientation of policy;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>indigenous knowledge and conceptions of cultural property;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the poststructuralist and Marxist philosophical framing of mass and new media studies;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>feminism;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the modern social scientific and techno-scientific domain of communications studies;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the dominance of history over literature in the post-colonial re-writing of national narratives; and</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>the moral and aesthetic focus of modern humanities, in the arts and literature, on individual sensibility.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is also worth noting that national histories of the book or print culture were being undertaken at the same time, marking both the profound significance of developments in information and communications technologies in the latter part of the twentieth century and the inseparability of media texts from the historical, social, political, economic, cultural and subjective contexts of their production and circulation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To think of a new humanities and a new cultural policy was to envisage resolving the problem of establishing a set of discursive and conceptual parameters on the basis of which highly disciplined and convergent intellectual analysis on all aspects of the work of media texts and technologies in societies and cultures (traditional to postmodern) could be carried out and the diverse audiences (citizens, government, business, media, the NGO sector, other academic disciplines) for this analysis could be appropriately addressed. It must be obvious that any consideration of a new humanities must encompass this spectrum of issues and relationships, so that any claim for the value of knowledge generated in the humanities must be demonstrable in any of these contexts. And, as advanced intellectual work carried out on behalf of the societies which fund it, it is its practitioners, and not its recipients, who must bear the burden of making the meaning of their intellectual work apparent and adaptable to the public’s interests, in whose name it is done. Speaking to government in a situation where most humanities practitioners believe that government cannot hear them requires finding a form of language which is audible; speaking to be heard in different territories of knowledge and practice now requires understanding of the specialist languages which define cultural and intellectual practice in the diversified institutional apparatus and systems of postmodern democratic societies. John Hartley has explored this complex of issues and has proposed the development of an overarching discipline of Cultural Science, which would investigate “the population-wide propagation of ideas and the future possibilities of knowledge in the context of cultural and economic dynamic systems – the ‘active audience’ as socially networked and actively learning <i>agent</i> of the media’s unintended consequences” (2012: 26, emphasis in the original). Hartley is very clear that any cultural policy or academic analysis must be based on a conception of creativity as an inherent human atttribute (“reflexive creativity is what enables human culture to adapt and change” (47)), on the critical role of institutions and organisations of all kinds in providing necessary conditions for the exercise of creativity, and on a much wider horizon of concern for the humanities, requiring an integrated theoretical framework capable of understanding postmodern societies and the ways they reproduce themselves through their citizens, their media systems, and their knowledge institutions. He affirms that “It is no good looking at creativity, culture, or knowledge as <i>professional or expert systems</i>, whether individualist or corporate […]. We need to understand cultural, creative, and knowledge systems <i>across whole populations</i>” (54, mphasis in the original). To conduct a new cultural policy, government needs the same understanding.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is not that no efforts have been made to develop forms of the humanities which can directly address problems and issues requiring policy responses from governments. I think I am right that the term “applied humanities” was first claimed by The Hastings Center, established in 1969 to promote the concept of bioethics as an intersection between philosophy and the biological and medical sciences. Many other such intersections, like art and music therapy, medical humanities, story scenarios, design, new media content, and video games are applications drawing upon some aspect of the humanities but typically motivated from other disciplinary and technical fields. For me, such “appropriations” are evidence of both the actual scope and potential relevance of knowledge in the humanities, and of the effects of the decline of the humanities into an increasingly darkened corner of Western universities as other (scientific and social scientific) ways of framing their traditional interests have become dominant.<sup><a id="note5" href="#note_5">5</a></sup> To claim that the humanities matter is to be able to demonstrate how the distinctive knowledge, methods of inquiry and interests of the humanities can be productively applied in society, and to articulate the key, cross-sectoral and cross-institutional partnerships which are needed for those applications to occur. In particular, it is not enough to rest on the notion that students trained in the humanities but employed outside the university are the principal means by which the humanities are disseminated locally outside the academic disciplines and their international extensions; they are a critical component in the diffusion of humanistic knowledge, especially across generations, but a much better understanding of their role and of the kinds of discursive competence they need to give effect to it is required. A good example (discussed in <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter Three</a>) of a focussed and sustained attempt to apply academic knowledge in the arts and humanities to community development is <i>Imagining America</i>, in which traditional boundaries between disciplinary specialists and arts practitioners, universities’ global orientation and the interests and needs of the communities in which they are located, are crossed with the aim of engaging diverse kinds of knowledge and experience in order to empower local agents through understanding, defining and forming solutions to local problems.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is a truism to say that knowledge in the world moves in very different ways and forms from knowledge in the academic disciplines, traditional or new; but the fertility and active potential of knowledge is compromised if that complex motion does not constantly permeate and challenge the borders and contents of the disciplines, like air currents in dynamic weather systems as they flow over territorial boundaries. For that to happen, and hence for disciplinary renewal to occur, humanities practitioners must be open not only to the worlds of knowledge represented by the texts of their disciplines, but also to the worlds of knowledge which constitute the everyday dynamism of living in a specific time and place and in which the texts mediating that knowledge circulate. Practitioners of a new humanities must be discursively amphibious and its mode of enquiry, to use a distinction applied by Meaghan Morris to the then new discipline of Cultural Studies, must be “a question-driven, not a doctrine or answer-driven, practice” (Australian Academy of the Humanities, 1991: 145) in a social order of multiple authorities and complex networks of association.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Australian Academy of the Humanities’ response to <i>Creative Nation</i> was to present a carefully composed panorama of the scope of research in the humanities in Australia, at a moment marked by its 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary and the publication of <i>Creative Nation.</i> The President, Deryck Schreuder, placed the symposium in the wider context of Australia’s “emergence as a post-colonial, independent society, strong in its identity and its public values.” The”new” in the programme could be recognised, for example, in the form of computing in the context of authorship and the compiling of authoritative editions of Australian texts; in the acknowledgment of Cultural Studies, in the opening out of attention to cultural production of all kinds and soon (1997) to constitute a new section in the Fellowship structure of the Academy; and as the role of law and history in the Mabo case, establishing aboriginal land rights and contributing to the understanding of Australian history as a mosaic of many histories. An important context for this symposium was the one held in 1991, which openly signalled in its title, <i>Beyond the Disciplines. The New Humanities,</i> the conviction that fundamental change was taking place and that the modern humanities disciplines were unavoidably caught up in this process. Just as the relation between <i>Creative Nation</i> and <i>Creative Australia</i> offers an opportunity for fruitful critical enquiry into shifts in cultural policy, so the relation between <i>Beyond the Disciplines</i> and <i>Challenging (the) Humanities</i>, which is discussed in the latter’s Introduction, makes apparent many of the components of a new humanities. Furthermore, each document points a subsequent reader to each formative and complex moment of composition and publication, and reading them together highlights shifts as well as continuities in public and academic discourse over three decades. Each text provides a position from which the others can be critiqued, revealing not only how new components of thought challenge for a place in a changing intellectual landscape but how changing priorities reveal the (more rapidly) shifting political and social environment of public decision-making.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s4.4"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-4">4. Cultural policy and the mark of humanity</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The education state is that iteration of the state the core institutions of which are founded upon, facilitate and respect the conversations flowing from the practice of citizenship along all the networks of communication a democratic society can provide for them. But, if citizens must be able to communicate with each other, and to extend local conversations to national and global domains through digital networks, significant extensions of literacy and changed conceptions of the ownership and management of communications systems are required. Writers have provided many anticipations of what happens when special interests dominate access to and the circulation of knowledge and information in democratic societies. Ray Bradbury in the 1950s imagined a future in which total control of media and education content by the state and private interests had been achieved by democratic processes, with profoundly destructive personal and social consequences, not least in education<sup><a id="note6" href="#note_6">6</a></sup>. Philip K Dick imagined in <i>The Simulacrum</i> (1964) a democratic society in which national public television was used by an industrial cartel to create an imaginary government using avatars and actors while running the nation in their interests in secret. It is not possible to believe that the increasing privatisation of all forms of communication infrastructure are in the interests of democratic development, no more than totalitarian state control could be. <i>Max Headroom</i> (1987) foresaw the intimate imbrication of corporate media, digital ICTs and politics for the purposes of corporate control of society, starkly imagined in a degraded city environment employing the imagery of cyberpunk fiction where television monitors were placed throughout the city, could not be turned off, and an illiterate population was subject to control by hidden elites represented by a media corporation. A more recent and trenchant expression of this consistent line of thought describes the notion of internet freedom as “a red herring. Calculatingly manipulative, it tells us to entrust a fundamental human right to a pair of powerfully self-interested social actors: corporations and states.’<sup><a id="note7" href="#note_7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">The task of education has both an individual and a public dimension. For the individual, it involves:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>acquiring and retaining knowledge of all kinds (that is, building a cultural inventory) and learning how to apply it innovatively in specific but always new situations, practically, ethically and self-reflexively;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>developing competence in the languages used to represent and think about that knowledge (including self-knowledge); and,</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">&#x2022;</span>achieving mastery in the use of communication systems required for effective participation as a citizen in a particular society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This learning is critical to becoming an adult and being able to play a substantive and life-long role in a democratic society. For this work to be accomplished, the education system must be supported and contextualised by public institutions tasked with conserving and providing access over the very long-term to a society’s (and humanity’s) stocks of knowledge and ensuring that the key elements of a communication system (like key elements of the life-world, for example, clean air and water) are universally available for use. A cultural policy is, then, first of all responsible for ensuring the continuance and evolution of these institutions, which can be understood to be prostheses extending singular minds beyond themselves into the complex flows of knowledge and networked interaction characteristic of postmodern societies. The task of government is to establish and maintain the conditions required for these institutions (at the heart of which is education) to provide a universally accessible means of acquiring knowledge, re-thinking it, and communicating that thought to others; it is not to privilege any one component of the knowledge field over others on the grounds that it has greater immediate importance, because that is to stay locked into the reasons why economic development (as more of what a nation already does and is familiar with) in practice takes the place of innovation (as the changing of paradigms in a nation’s conception of itself and what it does). Converting the potential of the future into actuality is the collaborative work of singular minds immersed in some part of a society’s resources of knowledge; creating and sustaining the best conditions for that work to happen is the work of government, carried out on behalf of the public.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cultural policy is necessarily political because it concerns a multiple, the cultures which people a nation-state and the complex of values, principles, knowledge and beliefs which constitute a culture. There is no singular into which cultures can be resolved, except by the application of totalitarian force, and even then uniformity in a cultural nation is impossible to maintain. All groups, whether local, nation states or global communities, are marked by internal differences in values and beliefs, which are a primary source of their means of revitalisation and redefinition as times and missions change.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have insisted that the singular citizen as a unique point of intersection for some part of the collective knowledge of humanity is the ultimate origin and medium of innovation, but that this extraordinary and universal capacity for creativity depends for its widespread exercise and effects on a very particular kind of social order, which I have called the education state. From this perspective, the framing principles for governance of such a state and made manifest in cultural policy would need to foreground the following universal human attributes and the semiotic systems and social formations which continue to be built on them: language, perception, memory, and communication. They are foregrounded here because they constitute the content and possibility of thought and its dissemination and hence of new knowledge in culture; a consequence is to make innovation policy a derivative - the critical derivative - of cultural policy. Reciprocally, cultural policy would be oriented away from its conventional identification with aesthetic forms and economic outcomes towards meaning making as the typical instance of knowledge creation. The exemplary scene of new knowledge formation and economic activity and hence the focus of cultural policy would not be the firm but the city/region and the institutions which extend or supplement these human capabilities and provide structure for human engagement in the conduct and evolution of increasingly complex built environments.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Of course, the singular mind is also singularly embodied; so cultural policy as I am envisaging it would necessarily include precisely what neoliberalism has worked so hard to abolish, policies for what I would call the caring state. Democratic governance has become sharply divisive in the past three decades, manifested as a kind of “soft” civil war of the 1% against the 99% using the infrastructure and law-making capabilities of the state, and abusing the public consent on which democratic law-making depends; it is now engaged in law- and decision-making typically unrepresentative of the interests of the publics of a democracy. An education state would establish new rules for governance through a cultural policy based on publicly determined standards setting out the core requirements for sustaining a human life worth having in a specific postmodern, urbanised society – including a living wage (or, now that it is being more fully considered, a universal basic income), healthy food, shelter, health and well-being, security, education, access to information and communication media, public transport, a clean environment – so that each citizen could understand and exercise both the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. These requirements can be abstractly stated, but they are culturally practiced and their implementation is never complete because it occurs in relation to an always receding horizon of social and economic change and the continual (re)defining of needs, rights and obligations in a specific nation-state, which continues to place under question the meaning and application of key principles, like equality and social justice.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The public institution which anchors all the rest in respect of the creation, dissemination, and evaluation of knowledge over a person’s life-time is education in its various stages and modalities. It is through education democratically conceived and with citizenship as its focus that all members of a society can learn what they need to know and what their society needs them to know as a foundation on which to build understanding of themselves and the world they have been born into, and to enjoy the rights and fulfil the responsibilities of citizenship. There is no core curriculum for this purpose, only curricula which give access to the diversity of human knowledge and explicate the literacies required to find meaning in texts of all kinds; but there are also forms of social and institutional learning (to do, for example, with money, law, sex and parenting, citizenship, and government) which need to be encountered at appropriate times in a person’s development because working knowledge of them is critical for effective participation in democratic processes and for the maintenance of society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Postmodern democratic societies now evolve as a consequence of the dominance (however fragile) of knowledge over environment, exemplified by the scale of the semiosphere and the formation of global cities. From the perspective of humanity rather than nature, the semiosphere is an expanding universe of signifiers, always full and yet always growing, creating semiotic space as it expands and, in the process, creating and recreating the idea of humanity from the energies released by reflection, critique, interpretation, intuition and imagination. The fundamentals required to sustain the semiosphere are institutions which objectify, conserve, and disseminate the products of those human sensory and cognitive capabilities which create time and place, self-consciousness, meaning, societies, goods, and economies: observation and perception, memory, language and communication, conception and judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The institutions built on the knowledge produced with these capabilities and constituting cultures can be summarily listed in respect of a dominant function:</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>observational</i>: all those agencies recording information about the given world and human society evolving in time and space;</p>
<p><i>memorative</i>: libraries, galleries, museums, archives and new kinds of digital repository;</p>
<p><i>disseminative</i>: educational organisations of all kinds, from the family and pre-school to university and the professions, churches, work places, civil society, and media of all kinds;</p>
<p><i>analytical, interpretive, experimental, creative and critical</i>: academic departments and research centres in all fields and sites of enquiry, think tanks, creative and performing arts, design, architecture, public sector agencies;</p>
<p><i>deliberative, regulatory and adjudicative</i>: the law, the justice system, the financial system and Parliament.</p>
<p class="noindent1">All of these distinguishable organisational formations, materialising human cognitive and expressive capabilities in built/technological forms, perform all of these knowledge functions to varying degrees and in different situations, and their textual productions can have, like the knowledge on which they draw and for which they are guardians, conservative and innovative characteristics. They are enmeshed, in other words, in the ordinary complexities of human social living in the shadow of history, however much a society at any time, and/or its government, can will the suppression of its collective memory and therefore of the institutions which sustain it. This does not need to be only a consequence of the totalitarian state; a progressive, future-oriented ideology can also diminish the value of social memory and the retention and active recollection of the documentary record of the past. The apparently acultural nature of the postmodern economy, for example, conceals its role in the global transmission of cultural values and social forms distinctive to the United States.</p>
<p class="noindent1">These institutions (whether of the private or public sectors, but my principal concern is with the public sector) are necessarily cultural institutions because they cannot exist independently of the specific historical, geo-political and economic dimensions of societies whose collective purposes they serve.<sup><a id="note8" href="#note_8">8</a></sup> Because their socially underpinning role is memorative, that of guardianship of a society’s resources of knowledge, they must also be publicly owned or regulated to ensure that the cultural and historical sources of a society’s present can be investigated by any member of that society as a means to self-understanding and social and cultural evolution. But their continuance and ability to serve the full range of functions and responsibilities humanity over time has invested them with is profoundly threatened by the withdrawal of the state from full responsibility for them. At the core is collective memory, not the possession of any person or social grouping but the anchor of cultural identity in all its various formations, from individual self-awareness to local, ethnic and national identities and global citizenship. Societies outlive their governments, for better or worse, but cultural institutions can be hollowed out or destroyed by governments which fail to grasp their fundamental importance to democratic societies in particular. Cultural institutions should exist for and on behalf of the public, as should governments in democratic societies, however much in practice that belief is compromised; but this is why cultural policy is the real test of the quality of democratic governance, at least when that policy (as knowledge policy) is understood to be about the whole of culture, and not only the arts.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the highest common factor linking human beings is the possession of culture, including a language, the lowest common denominator is a market economy, including some form of money. Because my focus is on the foundations of society in its accumulations of knowledge and their uses, I have not included the economy or business as a distinct institutional sector in my listing above, but I have included work as an integral human and social activity. Rather than being the generator of society, from this perspective an economy and its business organisations is one outcome of the application of a society’s resources of knowledge to meeting the needs of a population, and of the systems of storage and exchange developed (like languages) to facilitate the sharing and distribution of a society’s productivity. Because a market economy is the lowest common denominator of human interaction in society, it is easy to see why it has become the focus of government and the interests dominating and benefitting from it. But the starting point for public policy in a democratic state should be the generative ground (wellspring) from which everything else flows, and that is culture(s) evolving in the public space of a nation-state in which the free engagement of minds is enabled to produce the knowledge necessary to the sustaining and adaptability of that state over time. The key issue here for government policy formation for culture and innovation is a relocation of business to its proper place as a component of society and a cultural agent which is no more (or less) important than a society’s other major cultural agents like the family, education, the media, the arts and the nation’s repositories of cultural memory.</p>
<p class="noindent1">What are the overarching principles or propositions which bind policies being formulated in different sectors of government to one another? Currently, the economy together with the political principles of the party or coalition of parties in power would provide them; but it is immediately clear that this is not enough to provide a framework for the whole work of government, as current cultural policy clearly demonstrates. As I am arguing, the source of overarching principles for the governance of a democratic society are the principles of democracy which, when articulated as such, provide an objectified standard against which the interpretation of those principles – their meaning - by an individual citizen, a group, a party, an institution, a people can be tested and evaluated. It is through cultural policy, attentive to local “culture in the plural” and its translocal contexts, including the nation-state and its global hinterlands, that a formal educational policy which opens out on to and is supported by the public institutions discussed above can be designed.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s4.5"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-5">5 The Institutions and Settings of Cultural Policy for an Education State</a></h3>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s4.6"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-6">5.1 Observation and Perception</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">A knowledge society objectifies ordinary cognitive and communicative capabilities in the formation of specialised institutions for creating various types of knowledge. As Brier puts it, “All these types of knowledge have their origin in our primary semiotic intersubjektive [sic] life world of observing” (2012: 16) On this ground he argues both that “It is the human perceptive and cognitive ability to gain knowledge and communicate this in dialogue with others in a common language that is the foundation of science” (2008: 83) and that, as a consequence, “the methodological ideals of science, as well as the actual practise [sic] of science, are cultural products made by human minds linked by meaningful language communication in a society with a cultural horizon of meaning” (2010: 1904). Observation, and the technologies to record what is observed and to render it observable when unaided human senses are insufficient to perceive what is there to be observed (electron microscopes, the Hubble telescope, cameras, radar and so on), are fundamental to the growth of knowledge about ourselves and the world of which humanity is a part; but, as Brier observes, observation itself is a culturally framed activity, as are the institutions set up to regulate the creation of formal knowledge from it.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The work of the institutions of the state which command the high ground of policy is informed by knowledge derived by observation and perception of reality, natural and social, by members of those institutions but, even more, by others outside their borders who define the standards against which the truth value of such knowledge is assessed. An important effect of this orientation is to sustain the conviction that the work of Western governments is grounded in reality, even though much (most?) of that work is about hypothetical states of affairs, contingencies and potentials in that segment of reality which is the relations within and between states as the present moment transitions to its future form. Even if the administrative functions of the state continue to implement and enforce procedures which were developed in the past and have become (for good or ill) normalised as part of regulated social reality, its policy functions – confronted by hypotheses, contingencies, conflicting imperatives and imminent but indefinite futures – can only achieve a similar stability by imposing continuities on what is fundamentally discontinuous and heteronomous. If the condition of policy is also the condition of a culture when it is open to rather than reactive against or closed from its situation in the world of cultures and their impending futures, then cultural policy (with the arts as primary sources of observation and perception) becomes a powerful alternative basis for policy formation across the institutions of government.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In effect, all public institutions include within their scope observing ourselves and the given world from a specific position in it. Their potential power and public value lies in the ways that they can extend a singular mind’s perceptual processes for gaining information and producing knowledge by thought from it. Their unique responsibility, to observe what happens in all the dimensions of a nation’s life, discovering patterns, and providing information to government and the public – factually or fictionally, scientifically or artistically, in print or digitally – is central to the competence of a postmodern state. It is also influenced by dominant ideologies, by the history of that state, and by its standing among the states of the world and global institutions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But as institutions whose practices are currently governed formally by a universalist discourse and an ethic of seeing which is culturally neutral, they must diminish or suppress from consideration the local specifics which would otherwise give their policy work, advice and regulatory responsibilities its distinctive value locally, nationally, and in the international order by being marked by a distinctive, acculturated “way of thinking” which shapes perception. Public sector institutions can never be simply objective, whatever the claims for evidence-based policy and however they employ techno-scientific knowledge as the prime source of authoritative knowledge. They (and their officials who are their vital resource) observe the world through various lenses, all humanly designed. As Bevir has demonstrated in delineating the contribution of interpretive theory to new theories of governance, “Policy networks are seen as the contingent products of the actions of diverse individuals, where these individuals may act on very different beliefs and understandings formed by conflicting cultural traditions” (2010: 64). a position which adds another dimension to my argument for the primacy of cultural policy in the work of government.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s4.7"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-7"><i>5.1.1 Fiction at the Core of Policy</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">Placing art within the scope of institutions which conceive of their work as based solely on observation and perception of the real world makes possible a significant disruption of current conventions. Luhmann builds a fundamental part of his analysis of the art system on the position that “The work of art […] establishes a reality of its own that differs from ordinary reality. And yet, despite the work’s perceptibility, despite its undeniable reality, it simultaneously constitutes another reality, the meaning of which is imaginary or fictional. […] The function of art concerns the meaning of this split […] The imaginary world of art offers a position from which <i>something else</i> can be determined <i>as reality</i> – as do the world of language, with its potential for misuse, or the world of religion, albeit in different ways. Without such markings, the world would simply be the way it is. Only when a reality ‘out there’ is distinguished from fictional reality can one observe one side from the perspective of the other. Language and religion both accomplish such a doubling, which allows us to identify the given world <i>as real</i>” (2000a: 142). This double perspective is intrinsic to human thought; it is a specific kind of cultural and knowledge politics which would highly value knowledge derived from empirical reality and deny equivalent value to kowledge derived from fictional reality.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A table compiled to represent how the outcomes of a design process are dependent on the forms of enquiry being adopted is very helpful in this context for identifying the diversity of positions for thought which language makes available, and which collocate with fictionality. As Nelson and Stolterman observe, while change is a condition of life in the given world, designed change is a function of human intentionality, and consequently “the kinds of outcome available to a change process vary wildly” (2003: 43). Put another way, five of the six ends represent aspects of potentiality and emergence which are first realised in thought, imagined and objectified as texts (meeting reports, design briefs, plans, blueprints), before becoming new real things in the world.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Mapping this table together with Brier’s and Lotman’s conceptions of the integral role of fiction in human thinking produces a critical conclusion: the scope of the domain of fiction in mental work, which is also the space of the imagination, is massively greater than the scope of the real. And it is not possible to have the one without the other. For Luhmann, fiction is that operation which inserts thought into the world as texts constructing and communicating manifold imaginable, and therefore possible, conceivable and enactable, forms of reality. Traditional literary studies, and most particularly the study of poetry, have inserted this mode of knowledge creation into a grid of disciplines and administrative arrangements which have increasingly drawn their logic from the organisation and application of modern scientific knowledge. As the variety of media in which fictional narrative informs the creation of content has multiplied during the twentieth century, so has the presence in the university of this principle of complexity potentially expanded. This field of semiotic objects, recently a space within an institution (otherwise dedicated officially to rationality) for the development of sensibility and moral values, and then for political and social critique (aka the culture wars) is now being shared with those who would place fiction within the rationality of industrial production as content for the creative industries and as blueprints and design concepts for utensils, machines, buildings, bodies and landscapes, and those who would aim to employ narrative fictional forms in any medium as potent means for thinking and creating new knowledge about the possible evolutions of humanity and human values in postmodern/twenty-first century societies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Texts, and notably official texts, in so far as they claim to be governed by the real, are in fact governed by current conceptions of reality. In that respect, they largely diminish the possibility of significant innovation (in contrast to small variations on what is already the case) when written in conformity to current conceptions rather than by reaching forward into what is yet to be known. Policy work and those who commission it need to recognise the integral role played in it by fiction (as was recognised in a very limited way by Foresight discussed in <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter Three</a>), and to give high value to culturally inflected knowledge. This would permit, for example, a movement away from the attempt to bring traditional knowledge within the limits of Western science by using a descriptor like “indigenous science”. Instead, attending to the distinctive ways the diverse modes of acculturated human perception have observed reality and conceptualised it can open possibilities for thinking which have become blocked by a particular acculturated conception of reality.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Humanity lives among possible worlds as well as on this planetary one. Critical to our species capability for survival in and modification of our given world is the objectification of possible worlds in ways which allow collectivities of minds to think, plan and act together in the implementation of originally singular new thinking. Exemplary forms of this process of textual objectification are the texts which provide the principal objects of enquiry in the fields of literature, media, and creative and performing arts, narrative fictions. Fictions as the product of the creative imagination, as the invention and re-presentation of worlds which never actually existed, and knowledge claims derived from the interpretation of such texts, are typically held to have no truth value by the technoscientific university or by the technocratic government which is one of its extensions into the world of contemporary societies. But narrative fictions are a significant component of the semiosphere and, to use Lotman’s term, the object of their representation is “the universe of mind”, in which the given (visible) world, now conventionally taken as the standard for determining the presence of the real, is but one dimension. Furthermore, as Hastrup (2011) argues in respect of theatre, narrative fiction can generate culturally transformative meanings from an asymmetrical relationship between the knowledge and experience of its readers/spectators and its representation of knowledge and experience in the world imaginatively realised from performing a theatre text. This capability of fiction, and the work of interpretation carried on in the humanities, are together crucial in giving effect to their joint role in the creation of new knowledge in culture. What would be the role attributed to fiction in a university, or the Treasury or the Parliament, of an education state? Would it be marginal, as at present, valued as creative writing and so adding the traditional lustre of the arts to the truth-creating work of the sciences, or would it become a core source of the energy and vitality of the knowledge work of a creative university or an innovative government, the work of fiction holding equal place with the work of science in new knowledge creation?</p>
<p class="noindent1">No government is wise enough to see into the future, except in the form of best guesses made on the basis of forward projections from the present; but these are usually defined by organisations with interests in the outcome.<sup><a id="note9" href="#note_9">9</a></sup> What if speculative or future fiction became a basic source of cultural policy? The imperial expansion of the culture and methodologies of science has served to suspend or marginalise modes of thinking about complexity which have their basis in the human capacity to conceptualise complexity and to perceive it in social and cultural, rather than natural, terms<sup><a id="note10" href="#note_10">10</a></sup>. Literary fictional forms are the exemplars of this situation. Currently, they are of no account in official thinking about knowledge, which is dominated by modernist scientific models. But they are the exemplars because the matter from which they are composed is language, spoken and written, that is, symbolic matter, and the forms in which they are composed are means by which the uncontrollability/heterogeneity of language, society, subjectivity, human time and space is brought momentarily into an order which is conceptual, psychodynamic, perceptual, cognitive, social, cultural. What distinguishes the human in nature, that is, societies and cultures linguistically articulated – in values, ideologies, beliefs, politics, fictions, difference of all kinds – are elements in the production of knowledge with a much longer history than science. This knowledge is governed by other rules than those which govern science: most particularly, textual interpretation, not research in the scientific sense of the term, is the method by which new knowledge is produced; and fictional texts cannot be contained within any fixed system or grid of truth but always exceed any such system, and are always productive of different interpretations as the context of their interpretation changes.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A compelling example, given the present trials and failures of democratic societies, is Ray Bradbury’s <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, with its anticipation of faceless control through self-surveillance by democratic election, warfare engaged in by invisible elites, and the role of mass media in achieving and maintaining this state of affairs through the control of information in education and entertainment. But democratic governments are charged with responsibility for guiding the evolution of society towards a better version of itself, its fictional or possible futures implied, but not described, in the democratic principles informing public thought and values. It is the possible worlds imaginable from these principles which an education state would employ its resources to articulate in all their diversity in order to extend the boundaries of public knowledge, public thinking, public policy and decision-making.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s4.8"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-8">5.2 Memory and the Renovation of Society and Culture</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Debray (2000: 56) describes language as “the most tenacious of group memories”, pointing to the ways that it conserves within its structures and vocabularies the history of social evolution, which can always be recovered even though that history is normally hidden from a language’s users in everyday use and as they continue to extend its capacity to represent what is emergent in human experience. But the development of memory institutions represents a powerful and necessary augmentation of this power of language, objectifying knowledge as well as the past in collections of artifacts assembled partly by medium (manuscript, print, image, moving image, sound) and partly by institutional, material or aesthetic form (twentieth-century media archives, museums, art galleries, libraries, public record offices). These institutions, like churches, locate in the world and provide points of entry to that which is otherwise hidden and invisible, the semiosphere.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Without a memory, a human being has no identity; a society has no history; culture ceases to have any means of self-renewal or critique; innovation cannot occur. As Barnett (1953: 40) affirms, “A noticeable accumulation presupposes an interest in assembling and preserving ideas and things of the past. In societies wherein this interest is manifested the development of something new does not mean the elimination of something old; instead, it is added to the old as an alternative [...] Even if the old is no longer functional, it exists as a part of the inventory and may be revived. In short, accumulation results from a building of the past, not a discarding of it.” In nation-states, governments have assumed a principal responsibility on behalf of the nation for conserving the collective memory. The fragmentation and marginal status of our cultural institutions, and the increasing need for them to sustain themselves as heritage organisations appealing where possible to tourists,<sup><a id="note11" href="#note_11">11</a></sup> shows how little understood in government are the links between memory, knowledge and innovation. Our knowledge repositories operate with a generosity of understanding of their cultural roles that is remarkable given the relative lack of priority they have in the economic agendas of Western governments. The transformation of communications and information media is a profound challenge for them - as repositories, as means of access to global information, and as key components in our processes of cultural production. A new cultural policy is needed to establish the means by which cultural institutions can be full partners in an integrated infrastructure of agencies informed by an appropriate conceptualisation of their roles in a postmodern knowledge society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Thinking particularly of museums, David Carr (2011: xviii) asked, “What if our collections could be seen as structured situations, even maps, for finding our way together into the unknown and back, ways for sorting the contextual intangibles we all recognize in our lives, so we might imagine and understand the possible difference a single idea might make?” Such a question locates the purpose of a collecting institution in its ability, through its collections, the ways they are organised and from time to time exhibited, to bring diverse minds together in a collective enquiry into what is not now or not yet but could be energised by imaginative engagement with some aspect of the past. François Ost’s (2001) demonstration of the fundamental importance of heritage to a full understanding of what it means to be human provides a valuable set of terms for such a conceptualisation. He opposes “the symbolic” to “the state of nature” in its contemporary form of “the violence of the market”, and “transmission” to a “contractual conception of human exchanges” as the mode of exchange. Heritage is a “dual reality” because it belongs “not only to the tangible and material world but also to the realm of representation and meaning”; it is “a network of possibilities, a work of art awaiting a form, a text awaiting a meaning, a life awaiting a history. It is living material susceptible to regeneration, meaningful material susceptible to interpretation. It is also fragile, because subject to negligence, degradation and impairment.” These observations are brought together in “a strong hypothesis: without past and future generations, present generations are little or nothing. To deny our duty to remember the former and keep faith with the latter, to reduce the political community to the circle of our contemporaries, is quite simply to prevent ourselves from thinking in terms of the public realm. [...] What, on the contrary, resists and institutes, what confers identity on the subject and gives substance to the community, is the public realm in which speech circulates, accounts are transmitted, and common values tested” (155-157). In a contemporary situation in which it seems that “the future much more than the past [...] has to be safeguarded”, the heritage is not only what is remembered but rather “ - as its meaning is ahead rather than behind – the reformulation, the rewriting of an inheritance that is always pending, awaiting new witnesses for the redrafting of the will” (153). In this conception, a community’s or nation’s heritage is the recorded means by which that part of humanity can know itself, engaging the past, present and future in acts of new knowledge creation flowing from the unending reinterpretation of cultural objects and/as texts. In this view, heritage is not a collection of things which serve as reminders of the pastness of the past; it is an inherited public resource in engagement with which, through cultural work, the future possibilities of humanity can be articulated. As Barnett pointed out with respect to innovation, the quality and value of this cultural work depends profoundly on the scope of the cultural inventory available to individuals and hence on the institutions whose particular function is to conserve cultural heritage and make it accessible.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The recursive process of personal evolution – perceiving, learning, understanding, knowing, experiencing, reflecting, remembering, communicating - the foundation of cultural institutions and social adaptation, is also the focus of political and economic activity. To shape self-conceptions, values and desires is critical to the interests active in these dimensions of society, evidenced by the extraordinary investments of money and research time into human psychology and the means of effectively manipulating human action at a distance through techniques like advertising (and, of course, through the more coercive measures employed by police and military organisations). Here is one of the main sources of competition for the humanities, as they are now, and as a new humanities might evolve; all of these interests are concerned with how citizens think, about themselves and others, their society and government, the world at large, and all have investments in thought of a certain kind, enabling fulfilment of organisational purposes – brand recognition, successful competition in markets and politics, implementation of new technologies and laws, public support for military action, self-preservation, and so on.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The problem for the humanities is that the ground from which the humanities grow is the totality of texts expressing the meanings which have become defining of a particular society throughout its history, in the context of other societies’ interacting with one another over time through the circulation of texts. The work of interpretation, explication, and critique is embedded in these histories; it is not limited by any of the interests which from time to time dominate a particular state, but its goal is the same – to shape thought. The crucial difference is that the point of reference is not a specific organisation’s interests (not even a university’s, where much of this work is carried on) but as much of the totality of a society’s thought as a humanist interpreter of it is capable of embracing. And unlike the universality sought by science, however global the reach of humanistic enquiry, it must always return to its locality as the source of its energy and purpose, and to the singular minds taking shape there and then. As Debray (2000: 11) puts it, “in order to bring off transmission across time, to <i>perpetuate</i> meaning, in my capacity as emitting Everyman I must both render messages material and convince others to form into a group” because, without an institution to conserve messages, they will disappear and their potential as part of a culture’s inheritance from its past to contribute to its future will be lost. The memorative institution must not only conserve these records, but must also educate future readers in their use and interpretation because “Perpetuating meaning assigns an institution the dual mission of archival and pedagogical conservation.” But, Debray affirms, “only the living can stir the embers of meaning that slumber in traces of the past”; for this reason, there are two kinds of memory, “a mortal, or objective, memory and a living, or innovative, memory” (10). It is in the living memory, in which the meanings conveyed by the traces of messages from the past combine with knowledge and experience in the present, that innovations in thought and cultural expression occur. And, for them to be of possible value in the future, their records also need to be conserved as a deliberate action of public institutions.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s4.9"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-9"><i>5.2.1 The Library</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">Of all the cultural memory institutions, it is the library which has evolved in the closest association with the evolution of thought and knowledge and their modes of objectification in semiotic objects, for which written language is the primary sign system. Changes in the dominant information and communications technologies, in the institutions established to review, create and disseminate a society’s stock of knowledge, and in the demand for knowledge over time, can all be mapped from an historical perspective on the evolution of the library as an institution for the collecting and ordering of a society’s resources of recorded knowledge. A critical disjunct in the library’s institutional evolution occurred with the introduction of digital networked ICTs, because the genealogical line of these new devices was outside the established humanistic traditions of knowledge work, its publication and conservation, and the print and paper devices and cataloguing systems developed for those purposes. In effect, the institution of the library was initially marginalised rather than incorporated from the beginning in the conception of the new cognitive technologies. In particular, as is now widely recognised, the memorative functions of the systems of the library were overlooked, even though, as befits a cognitive machine, computers were given memories<sup><a id="note12" href="#note_12">12</a></sup>. The problem was the collective memory, no IT developer’s or private investor’s responsibility, a problem magnified because of the enormous increase in the production of data, information and knowledge which itself became part of the evidence of qualitative change signified by the terms information or knowledge society, and because of the failure in the late twentieth century to appreciate how technological obsolescence would imperil the continuation of the collective memory of humanity. The marginalising of cultural and archival institutions established and managed according to the pre-digital forms of material record and classificatory criteria developed by professionals trained in the humanities, stand as a dramatic sign of the marginalising of the humanities as a body of knowledge and practices producing knowledge of value for postmodern democratic societies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The semiosphere is a uniquely human, collective invention, and its continuance depends on collective action, through all the institutions which have been created to conserve humanity’s collective memory. These institutions remain fundamental to the possibility of the arts and the humanities, and therefore to the possibility of creating new art and pursuing new self-understanding. In respect of the former, Luhmann (2000a: 303) makes a point which is also relevant to fields like fashion and design:</p>
<p class="quote">The art of the past has become history. This precludes the simple repetition of existing works or styles. By losing the self-evidence of its binding force, the art of the past relinquishes its forms and styles as material to be exploited. Museums (and, in a different way, libraries) now serve as a system-internal context against which the new can distinguish itself <i>and which is indispensable for this purpose</i>. […] Even if, under the signature ‘postmodernism,’ insistence on the novelty of the individual work has been replaced by the freedom to combine traditional forms, the self-historicization of art remains bound to the distinction between the new and the old (emphasis in the original).</p>
<p class="noindent1">This distinction opens the necessary space for new knowledge creation in the humanities altogether, deriving from the “freedom to combine” the results of a specific trajectory of reading and writing. While a university’s map of learning is represented most obviously in discipline-defined schools, departments, and research centres, the place where the university is most properly itself is the university library, because there texts assume relations on the real and virtual shelves and in the now digital catalogue that they might never assume in any curriculum, and where texts unknown to specific disciplines and their expert representatives can be encountered by a seeking mind, opening mental doors to new worlds of thought. Collections, in this digitally networked context, are not necessarily held physically in the one place. A critical issue now is, who takes responsibility for ensuring that the relevant collection contents, wherever they might be located, remain accessible to users in a national domain, whether those users are physically located there, or somewhere else. My argument at this point is an extension of the print period argument for national public libraries. There can be no guarantee that private knowledge businesses, the obvious example being Google, can achieve the long term stability of public institutions which is required for the conservation of a society’s knowledge assets, or exercise the quality of guardianship of those assets and open access to them which is required for sustaining the collective memory of humanity.<sup><a id="note13" href="#note_13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Because of the agency attributed to digital ICTs (rather than to the companies which were impelling their development), libraries were left to catch up with this drastically different knowledge technology while society’s resources were applied to purchasing and installing machines and infrastructure, the retraining of knowledge workers, and the education of new generations of post-print literates identified by the term information literacy (a term which characteristically meant the ability to use the new technologies, rather than signifying a move to a higher level of sophistication in the use of information). Library professionalism was redefined as information management, conceived as knowledge of systems rather than of the content of collections. Public libraries were recognised as portals to the “information super-highway” at a stage when the majority of people could not be expected to own a device themselves for connecting to the Internet. National Libraries have, in the public interest, led the way in shaping the evolution of the institution of the library in this new situation, by developing methods of collecting born-digital material (and especially websites as a new medium of publication), providing networked access to collections in all media forms, leading digitisation standards processes for digitising pre-digital texts, negotiating access to privately owned collections of research publications as global media companies acquired the rights to and established large stables of previously printed and publicly accessible academic journals, and attempting to shape public policies for the conservation of and access to knowledge. Furthermore, in a context of globalisation, and the impossibility of any library’s achieving a comprehensive collection of the world’s published knowledge, the importance of approaching collecting from a local perspective – the published knowledge produced in and about a locality, community, region or, in the case of national libraries, the nation as a historically constituted community of shared interests - has shaped policy and practice in respect not only of born digital objects, but of objects in any post-print medium. Librarians were, and remain in their new digital habits, the cartographers of the semiosphere.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The unresolvable diversity of their collections – containing texts in diverse languages, genres and media forms, composed in diverse historical, geographical and cultural settings – and hence of the semiosphere is now more completely represented by the Internet and the Web, not least because it includes much that would not have been traditionally selected into a heritage collection, or studied by academic humanists. The Internet was conceived of by Neal Stephenson in his novel <i>Snow Crash</i> (1992) as a universal, and privatised, digital library, resulting from the merger of the Library of Congress and the CIA, a compelling fictional extrapolation from the double goal of reform in the 1990s, to reduce the role of the state in society and to privatise its functions. Despite the way in which the private sector continues to expand its interests over semiotic territory as though it were land held by customary title, libraries, archives, museums, and galleries remain fundamental cultural institutions; they survey, map, order and make accessible the information world for and on behalf of the public, because social and cultural evolution are, unlike the economy, dependent upon collective memory. The semiosphere has no inherent order or reflexivity; it is the special responsibility of cultural institutions and the humanities to ensure the ongoing conservation, public accessibility, circulation and interpretation of humanity’s stores of non-genetic information in the long term. This work is educative, creates public value and requires public institutions.<sup><a id="note14" href="#note_14">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">In a wide-ranging and deeply thoughtful meditation on the institution of the library, Alberto Manguel (2006) positions himself and his reader about as far as possible from the present dominant concern with the commercial value of knowledge by asking why we bother recording what we have come to know: “Outside theology and fantastic literature, few can doubt that the main features of our universe are its dearth of meaning and lack of discernible purpose. And yet, with bewildering optimism, we continue to assemble whatever scraps of information we can gather in scrolls and books and computer chips, on shelf after library shelf, whether material, virtual or otherwise, pathetically intent on lending the world a semblance of sense and order” (3). Manguel could be writing as the Librarian author of Borges’ story, “The Library of Babel.” Here the issue is neither the material forms nor the buildings used to make and keep these records, but the need for meaning and the pathos which so often accompanies it which motivates both the publication and conservation of what humanity has come to know and believe about our situation in the universe. In many ways, the particular examples of libraries which Manguel reflects upon, both his own and other personal and public libraries from the earliest known, dating from the third millennium BC in Mesopotamia (109), serve an allegorical function, representing particular instantiations of the semiosphere as it condenses in the mind and around the person as a distinctive sample from its ever-expanding totality. Both the physical form of a library and its internal arrangement carry a weight of meaning. Of Michelangelo’s Laurentian Library he writes that “the stern windows and recurrent volutes, and the complex and dynamic stairway perfectly illustrate the paradoxical nature of a library. The first suggests that it can be an ordered, contained place where our knowledge of the universe can be gracefully stored; the second implies that no order, no method, no elegant design can ever fully hold it” (160-161). Warburg’s Library amplifies the second aspect of the paradox:</p>
<p class="quote">Most libraries give an impression of systematic order, of an organization made manifest by themes or numbers or alphabetical sequences. Warburg’s library shows no such system. When I visited the reconstructed reading room in Hamburg (which today holds only a small part of his volumes) and inspected the rounded shelves in the oval central chamber, the feeling I had was bewilderment; it was like standing in the midst of a foreign city whose signposts doubtlessly meant something but whose sense I couldn’t fathom. The shelves suggested to the eye an uninterrupted association of titles, not a linear order with a beginning and an end. [...] Warburg’s system was closer to that of poetic composition (204).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Brier notes that even the most experienced librarians agree no more than 75% of the time on how a book should be catalogued<sup><a id="note15" href="#note_15">15</a></sup>. Warburg’s library foregrounds the effectively unlimited potential for association between books, partly affected by their physical juxtaposition and partly by the sequence in which they are read by a particular reader. Manguel reflects that, “Perhaps every library is ultimately inconceivable, because, like the mind, it reflects upon itself, multiplying geometrically with each new reflection” (196).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Here is the essence of the humanities, old and new; a collection standing in for the totality of humanity’s texts, generating in each singular mind by their association and through reflection multiple possibilities of meaning and new textual creation. Because the human mind, reading and thinking, is like that when free: generative, expansive, a stranger to closure, an active node in the manifold networks linking minds and ideas in evolving cultural formations.</p>
<p class="noindent1">And here, too, is the ground of cultural policy as knowledge and innovation policy: to establish and maintain the conditions required for free minds to generate new meanings, communicate them to others, and have them remembered so that they are capable of (re)discovery in the future. As Debray wrote, “a lineage of cultural evolution singles out, from a complex of available innovations, the ones most meaningful to it and that it alone can best optimize” (2000, 50); no individual has the power to select from the new what matters collectively now, and no organisation operating on behalf of a sector or interest can make certain choices for a culture or nation. What Debray underlines here is that innovations become significant when they connect with and are shaped by meanings which are integral to the formation of a culture and persist over time, while themselves contributing to the evolution of that culture and the adaptation to new circumstances of its inherited stock of knowledge. The crucial work of cultural policy in innovation is therefore the understanding of those foundational meanings and their modulation over time as the principle informing the recognition and implementation of innovations. The key term is “optimize”; the potential of an innovation is accomplished when it is acculturated, not by force but by recognition of its cultural potential in a particular time and place.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s4.10"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-10">5.3 Communication: Language, Conversation and Media Technologies</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">If a democratic society’s institutions both anchor its foundational principles and help it to adapt effectively to new or changing circumstances and beliefs, their effectiveness depends upon a communication system comprising open networks enabling them to connect to one another and citizens to connect with them and to each other. Since, without a communication system, there can be no society, it is hardly surprising that an enormous body of analysis and commentary is directed towards this aspect of social organisation. But it is surprising, especially in a small democratic society like Aotearoa New Zealand, that the state should be so apparently casual about this complex function and so ready to treat it as the preserve of the private sector and the market in communication products, whether technological, educational, cultural or recreational.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rather than engaging here in the obvious political, economic and ideological critique of this situation, my intention is to set down a small number of key points derived from Luhmann on the basis of which the argument for the centrality of communications in cultural policy can be advanced. It is necessary to establish the most general position first so that the interests of every citizen in the effective functioning of communications (rather than the interests of elite and expert segments of the population) are placed in the foreground.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The current tendency is to assume that access to and use of media technologies constitute the critical dimension of communications, especially in public policy, education and telecommunications. But for Luhmann (2000a: 139) the enabling medium “not only of communication but also of consciousness” is meaning. He writes that “Communication can no longer be understood as a ‘transmission’ of information from an (operatively closed) living being or conscious system to any other such system. Communication is an independent type of formation in the medium of meaning [Sinn], an emergent reality that presupposes living beings capable of consciousness but is irreducible to any one of these beings, not even to all of them taken together” (8). This emphasis reorients thinking about communication away from the current technological infrastructure, which is where most of the economic value of communications is located, and towards its primary purpose, which is to link singular minds into the social collectivity of meaning and understanding as beneficiaries of the thought of others before them and as contributors to the on-going expansion of this primary social resource, which I am equating with cultural knowledge. Furthermore, by emphasising meaning rather than knowledge Luhmann shifts attention away from the kinds of knowledge which can circulate globally as universally true towards the kinds of embodied knowledge which are always already enveloping society, are positioned by and emergent in time and place, are constantly modified by their usage and circulation from person to person, and meld factual information, experience, values and beliefs. For this linking of minds to be possible, it is not enough to have access to technological networks; since “Communication relies on the perception of signs” (16), the ability to use the sign systems of society and acquisition of the knowledge common to members of a society is critical, and that means acquiring education and literacy. He does not assume that communication is inherently transparent or rational: “Communication can tolerate and even produce vagueness, incompletion, ambiguity, irony, and so forth” (11), qualities normally associated with deception, intellectual confusion, satire and poetry, the antithesis of formal knowledge and accurate information but socially purposeful. More importantly, communication typically requires judgment and decision-making in the process of understanding what is communicated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Luhmann argues that all social functions “can be traced to problems of meaningful communication. Meaning serves as the medium not only of communication but also of consciousness. Because meaning is actualised “in an instant of experience or of communication […] any operation that is controlled by meaning must move beyond actuality toward what is otherwise possible. Something pertaining to the realm of potentiality must be actualized, which in turn requires that the difference between actuality and potentiality occur at the heart of experience and communication. [This] suggests that all the problems to be solved in the system of society are directly or indirectly related to the structure of meaning” (139). To point in this direction is to point beyond formal knowledge and its application to the envelope of culture within which ordinary living and thinking occurs and which makes communicating between minds possible. Comprehending this structure and discovering by attending to the conversation of society what are understood diversely to be the “problems to be solved” as this understanding is produced by experience and advanced by communication amongst the members of a society is a core task for cultural policy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Although Luhmann focuses on the medium of meaning as the primary medium in communication, this should not exclude consideration of the role media technologies play. As Mark Poster (1990, 56) defines the issue, “Each method of preserving and transmitting information profoundly intervenes in the network of relations that constitute a society.” The communication system of a society is not personally, socially and culturally neutral, but it defines in its design and its component parts the practices and terms of its use and therefore shapes its users to the purposes, self-conceptions and values which have been designed into its operation. Current discussions about the way in which social media sites shape their users to the interests and culture of the owners and designers of a site while being deficient in the forms of social regulation all societies have to devise is just an immediate example of Poster’s axiom.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At its most basic, then, the task of cultural policy is to comprehend the conversation being carried on by a nation’s publics through that nation’s communication system, and to resource that conversation through the cultural and media institutions tasked with preserving and transmitting information. This is not a matter of opinion polling, or of covert surveillance. It requires being able to recognise shifts in meaning as instances of what is potential becoming actualised, cultural evolution adapting through communication its lineages of meanings to newly perceived states of affairs while simultaneously giving specific shape and direction to those states of affairs as they are actualised in texts and events. It also requires attending to what it is possible for any person to know, in terms both of training, education and experience and of means of access to a society’s stocks of knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This is to say that an education state cannot have a serious cultural policy without having a communications policy which starts with language as the exemplary (and most complex) medium of cultural transmission, storage and knowledge formation, but also attends closely to the various means of expression, transmission and storage, including the institutions which sustain and regulate these social capabilities.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s4.11"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-11"><i>5.3.1 Language</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">The potential in innovation policy only becomes apparent when it develops within cultural policy, so that the four types of knowledge identified by Brier as constituting modern western culture are together active in policy formation, rather than the situation at present, where policy thinking is grounded solely in science and technology as the model of knowledge formation and transmission, where the discourse of science is its mode of formation and dissemination, and where business is its primary social site of application. As a universalist mode of knowing, (Western) science and technology is experienced by its practitioners as ideally expressed in a universal (transparent) language - which for practical purposes is English (especially, that is, for first language English speakers).<sup><a id="note16" href="#note_16">16</a></sup> The traditional Christian conception of language diversity as a divine punishment, the consequence of the hubristic abuse of scientific and technological knowledge represented in the building of the Tower of Babel, has played a critical role in establishing in the West the role of science as the means of recovering that original, uncorrupted language in which the truth can be truly expressed, and technology as the means of recovering humanity from the socially and environmentally destructive results of original sin.<sup><a id="note17" href="#note_17">17</a></sup> In the postmodern era, however, this socially progressive conception of science has come under much criticism, as science and technology have entrenched their position, especially with governments, as the modern knowledges of overwhelming power and authority. In particular, in the context of postcolonial experience and the break down of the binary world order symbolised by the destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the conception of the confusion of languages (as the dominant interpretation of linguistic diversity, a problem to be solved technologically) is being increasingly challenged by the view that cultural diversity as a foundational public good and a condition of human sociability is premised on the maintenance of linguistic diversity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Given that one of the most ancient ways by which human beings have conceived of themselves as distinct within the orders of living species is the possession of language, it is remarkable that language has so slipped to the periphery of attention in government that one is hard pressed to find any attention being given to it as a domain of government responsibility except in the context of New Zealand’s official languages (where it is Māori as a threatened language which is the focus of attention) or in concerns about literacy. Special forms of language, for example, literature, are formally included in arts policy and funding; but the cultural traditions and texts of European culture are as marginalised as the humanities in school and university curricula, and there is no government Ministry of the Humanities to recognise the role of advanced literacy in cultural production, critique and knowledge policy formation. As it is in normal social practice, language is simply invisible except when an intention to communicate fails. Suzette Haden Elgin argues in her discussion of the need for language policies which support multilingualism that, “If speaking a language were like brain surgery, learned only after many long years of difficult study and practiced only by a handful of remarkable individuals at great expense, we would view it with similar respect and awe. But because almost every human being knows and uses one or more languages, we have let that miracle be trivialised into ‘only talk.’ We forget, or are unaware of, the power that language has over our minds and our lives” (2000: 239).<sup><a id="note18" href="#note_18">18</a></sup> Luhmann distinguishes between the way language in art is used connotatively and ambiguously, in contrast to everyday communication which displaces these qualities with “unambiguous denotative meaning” (2000a: 25) and is “concerned with automating understanding” (40). Hampshire makes a complementary claim, that “The writing and speaking of English, and the language itself, are sustained by those who extend the resources of the language, and who refine upon its range and powers of expression, permanently, by their invention. These are the poets, dramatists and novelists of our time. We live and think in the language which their predecessors have gradually, over centuries, formed for us, and to which they are adding now” (1976: 15). The extraordinary multiplication of terms for things and concepts needed for naming the new objects in the world and for thought which technoscience has created must also be recognised here; but the work of artistic invention, which serves to extend over time the expressive capabilities of a society’s language(s) for thought and its communication in ordinary use, must be recognised at the heart of innovation policy. Paradoxically, language’s normal invisibility is also the sign of how absolutely constitutive of society in all its operations language is. It is equally a mark of the present location of value and policy formation that, if democratic governments were to be asked what is absolutely constitutive of society, the typical answer now would not be “language” but “the economy, stupid.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">Lotman (2009: 134) states the key point with admirable succinctness: “For human thought all that exists is that which falls into any of its languages.” Without granting the fundamental role of language in knowledge formation there can be no effective innovation policy. It is not enough to say that knowledge creation is carried out by artists as well as scientists; we need to know how new knowledge is produced and circulated in society (not only for or in the economy), and how it interacts with and modifies existing knowledge. A theory of the role of languages in the evolution of knowledge societies should lie at the heart of a foundational cultural policy; a powerful statement about the complex issues embedded in this position can be found in <i>The World Ahead: Our Future in the Making</i>, a UNESCO publication which considered a spectrum of critical global issues in terms of four contracts: social, natural, cultural, and ethical. It is worth observing that, if a government were to organise itself on the basis of these four bonds between people and the world in which we live, it would have to substantially reconfigure its conception of its role; it would also challenge political parties to make the implications of the politics of their policy positions explicit. But this becomes another way of grasping why cultural policy is foundational. The natural and social worlds are apprehended and engaged with by the citizens of a nation state through the lens of culture, which is also the immediate source of ethical norms and the authority to enforce them. To govern a democratic and multi-cultural society with insight requires formal understanding of the complex forms of knowing and valuing which distinguish the various cultures composing a nation state from each other and the similarities which connect them.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The chapter on language in <i>The World Ahead</i> focusses on the issue of linguistic diversity, and notes that it is “still a long way from receiving the same kind of recognition as biodiversity” (Mayor 2001: 341). The writers foreground two aspects of language which are of fundamental importance to my argument: linguistic diversity is maintained by “the tendency of languages to split into dialects. [...] they evolve ceaselessly and constantly adapt to their environments”; and “no language is inherently ‘superior’ to another; each performs its role in a specific cultural, economic, social, ecological and political context and each describes in its own particular way a different environment” (339-40, 342). These conceptions of the nature and work of language point directly to the proposition that language should therefore be a primary source for, as well as a focus of, cultural policy: language is the most dynamic, sensitive and informative means available to humans to recognise and manage change as a deliberate process. This is, after all, what policy discourse aims to do. Cultural diversity - in Boissot’s terms, the overlapping of fields of information - is the key requirement for innovation. Cultural and linguistic diversity are reciprocals.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A particularly strong statement of the position that language is the most significant cultural resource is made by Fern Johnson, in <i>Speaking Culturally.</i> What he calls the “Language-Centered Perspective on Culture” is based on the affirmation that “The system of <i>language and communication</i> is the central resource used by human beings to create, maintain, and change culture” (Johnson, 2000: 58) and that the complexity of culture arises from “(a) the communication and intermingling of peoples with different origins, identities and allegiances and (b) the interplay of the real and imagined past, the perceived present, and the projected future, whether probable or fantasized” (48). Such an approach does not permit a distinction to be made between culturally laden and culturally free modes of language use; instead, for Johnson, “All communication bears cultural origins, conveys cultural meanings, and is interpreted through cultural frameworks. [...] human language [is] the cornerstone of cultural meaning within an interrelated set of systems for elaborating cultural resources that includes ideational patterns [...] and cultural products and events” (45). In taking this approach he is following a line of thought which has much in common with Barnett’s conception of innovation as the mental work of combining ideas which are already in circulation within a society’s communication system or to be found among its stocks of knowledge. The interactivity between culture and language provides the possibility for social change and adaptation: “Cultural frameworks give rise to particular languages, which in turn shape mental processes and the organization of reality, which in turn create cultural frameworks. Cultural frameworks can be renewed, refreshed, reformulated through ever-changing processes involving language” (51-52). In New Zealand, the case for language as a critical national issue is typically made in the context of the recovery of Māori language and Māori culture; it is not perceived generally to be a significant issue for Pākehā, except in the residual sense of “European heritage” and the more urgent problem of trade with countries for which English is not the first language. In many respects, however, Johnson’s arguments have a special import for New Zealand English as a variety of world English, that is, as a means of cultural differentiation as well as a means of global communication. If we begin at the point that Johnson does, when he writes that “linguistic enculturation from within native speech communities provides the foundation from which all other discourse options become elaborated. […] Most people today are entailed in multiple cultures, offering multiple bases for identity” (53), then it is the speaking of a local language which initially anchors cultural identity and difference, and it is access to other cultures, languages and varieties of language which impels cultural change and innovation.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s4.12"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-12"><i>5.3.2 Conversation</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">To ask in what the power of conversation consists is to ask in what does democratic power consist, thought of as the heterogeneous flows of knowledge and understanding among collectivities distributed across the whole of a society (and now, the whole of humanity as “global society”). Opinion polling is a good example of how this knowledge and understanding is contextually modulated by individuals’ shifting awareness of what is at stake at any moment (one increasingly potent input into which is media representation and media organisations’ cultural-political investments), and how those shifts are nonetheless anchored in continuities of thought, as these are condensed over times and places in cultures composed of family histories, systems of law, belief and value, conceptions of reality, technologies, social, economic and governmental structures and institutions, customs and ideologies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">What, then, is the base condition which a new cultural policy should aim to establish if innovation is to be understood to be a cultural process dependent on individuals’ access to a society’s stock of knowledge and their integral role in its rethinking and circulation? Given the now widely investigated question of innovation in the economy, in the tight circuit of the science-technology-business-military nexus, the answer I propose will seem tinged with absurdity. But the issue for a postmodern democratic knowledge society is not about interests or hegemonic knowledges; it is about the public and most general resource of a society which is often invoked in innovation discussions, especially when considered in terms of deficits in intellectual and social capital, that is, the minds of its people and their generative powers. In the Warwick Commission report, for example, the point is made and reinforced throughout that the creative capabilities of a society are limited to the extent that significant segments of the population are excluded from exploring and developing their capabilities as a consequence of poverty, abbreviated education, and limited access to their society’s resources of knowledge of all kinds. In this state of deprivation (as seen from the perspective of society’s inherited resources as a totality), people nonetheless create cultures (criminal as well as legitimate) and modify their cultural inheritances in association with each other to provide working knowledge for living in the social and economic environment in which they find themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent1">How can this working knowledge escape its immediate context of creation and become accessible to others? This question sidesteps any attempt to evaluate knowledge, to weigh its relative worth from a specific perspective like, say, commercialisation of an idea, or to advance a social policy of redistribution of wealth, equalising of opportunity etc (although a political party could add these goals), and points instead to the ways knowledge flows (or is obstructed from flowing) throughout society, from node to node in social networks where the nodes are singular minds. The term capturing the critical social mechanism making this process possible is conversation. So, does this mean that a government has to have a conversation policy? Currently the debate over secret mass surveillance of private communications could be seen as a sign that democratic states regard conversation between citizens as dangerous to their interests (rather than to the public interest); reciprocally, the conduct of government through “conversation behind closed doors” and the suspicion it can raise about private interests displacing public interests in official decision-making emphasises the divergence of state interests from public interests. As Milton observed (1644/1974: 200-201), the publishing of thought can be dangerous to the state but the risk of closing a door on access to new learning and insight is in principle greater than any perceived threat to the state.<sup><a id="note19" href="#note_19">19</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">An excellent description of conversation occurs in the course of defining the terms on which professional design practice should be conducted, and it picks up the double aspect of a mode of exchange between people which involves attention to the difference of another’s speech, and what might be implicit as well as explicit in what is said, face to face or at a distance: “The ability to convey and listen to the other is at its best when the exchange is heard as if it’s a <i>conspiracy</i> (i.e., a breathing together) of <i>conversation</i> (i.e., a turning together). To have a conversation is to explore the other; to find relations and connections that can serve as starting points for contracts and fuller relationships” (Nelson and Stolterman, 2012: 176). In another context, research into the requirements for the formation of a knowledge society in New Zealand identified a specific linguistic process and competence – intermediation, or the process of translating between different communities of expertise in order to facilitate the circulation of knowledge across society - as critical to innovation (O’Brien et al, 2000: 22-23). Researchers into innovation within firms have identified conversation, understood as the linguistic facilitation of exchange between people with different kinds of knowledge, to be a key activity in the development of new ideas and products (von Krogh et al, 2000: 125-146). From this perspective, language is not simply a background competence but a critical, dynamic element in innovation. These issues have been brought together by Fonseca in his study, <i>Complexity and Innovation in Organizations</i>, where he argues that innovation is “the emergence of new meaning and that such new meaning emerges in conversations between people [...] innovation in organizations is fundamentally a conversational process in which meaning is continuously dispersed” (2002: 7). A competent democratic state listens to the manifold if not in effect infinite public conversations occurring throughout society, not secretly to detect threats to itself but openly to understand movements in ideas and cultural meaning and discover patterns among the signs of society’s possible futures.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The one attribute conversation between people located anywhere in society will not typically be granted is creativity or innovativeness in ideas. More usually, ordinary conversation from a policy perspective will be regarded as Jonson regards the conversation of the (female) critics of his plays who he stages as Gossips in <i>The Staple of News</i>, inexpert, interested in local family matters and celebrity rather than moral substance and truth, attracted by youth and promise rather than gravity and wealth, evaluating social events and persons according to their shared experience and values. But Jonson, despite his evident dislike of everything that the Gossips represent in their use of language, writes in for them a defence which can be read otherwise to what he clearly intended. One of the Gossips, Tattle (the others are Mirth, Expectation and Censure), refers to anecdotes circulating in their locality and says, “But whether it be true or no, we gossips are bound to believe it an’t it be once out and afoot. How should we entertain the time else, or find ourselves in fashionable discourse for all companies, if we do not credit it and make more of it in the reporting?” (Act III, Third Intermean, ll.37-41). In the notion of adding value, Jonson allows however dismissively that passing information from one mind to another always modifies it. Without the learned controls of humanistic scholarship or scientific method, the stability and truthfulness of knowledge is challenged. But unless those controls are themselves challenged, especially from “outside”, from beyond the boundaries of current official knowledge, new perceptions and conceptions actualising human and social potential may be ignored or suppressed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">While Olssen et al have elaborated a powerful case for the priority of education over the economy as the primary object of government, their argument about the responsibility of government to education needs to be extended beyond the formal education system to include the now traditional cultural institutions – museums, galleries, archives and libraries – and their digital extensions, public media organisations, and those performing and conserving the repertoire of the arts which a society inherits from its past and is renewed and extended by artists in the present. The key factors in this extension are the common concern with what it means to be human and a humanistic conception of democratic principles manifested in the characteristic product of their work, an informed encounter between citizens using modes of conversation and negotiation in whatever medium to the end of advancing a personal and collective purpose. Overcoming the “democratic deficit” (Horner and Hutton, 2011: 116) and finding a way to a better democratic future depends on the quality, diversity and inclusiveness of the conversations a society carries on with itself. The radical implications of this position have been stated unambiguously by de Certeau in his reflections on the events of May 1968, which “affirmed a wild, irrepressible, new right, a right that has become identical with the right of being a human, and no longer a client destined for consumer culture or instruments useful for the anonymous organization of society. This right commanded, for example, the reactions of assemblies that were always prepared to defend it whenever it appeared to be threatened in the heat of debate: ‘Everybody has the right to speak.’ But this right was only given to those who spoke in their own name” (1998: 11). The informing conception is humanistic because the relation of exchange which is established is premised upon “the irreducible moral status of each person” (Olssen et all, 2004: 236). Derrida uses another phrase, “irreplaceable singularity” (1987: 37) which extends the implications of this founding of democracy on the person of the citizen by underlining how each person is formed over time as a unique intersection of cultural, moral, linguistic, historical, familial, ethnic, economic, technological, governmental and environmental inheritances and forces. And can be silenced over time as well, as Sundaram (2106: 140) writes of dictatorship: “A society unable to speak was like a body that did not feel pain: one could cut off one’s limb and not know it, or be told that this was progress. We needed to go from a single voice to a plurality, to counter the government in this way, merely by speaking, so that people would be come aware of the existence of an alternative, aware of what was happening around them. In speaking society would struggle, and feel its own pain.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">A striking example of the foundational thinking needed in the formation of an education state based on such a conception of humanity represented by linguistic rather than economic exchange is David Carr’s <i>Open Conversations. Public Learning in Libraries and Museums</i>, which takes as its double focus the singular citizen and democratic cultural institutions which do not exercise a role in the formal education system, do not have to work to negotiated curricula and national assessment systems, and do not command much interest in the context of knowledge economy and innovation policy development. He offers his reader an invitation:</p>
<p class="quote">Thi<i>nk with me</i>. What if the museum, the library, the zoo, the history collection, the children’s art studio, the science and the natural sciences collections, what if they are all about becoming something together – becoming thoughtful together, and striving to imagine together? What if our collections could be seen as structured situations, even maps, for finding our way together into the unknown and back, ways for sorting the contextual intangibles we all recognize in our lives, so we might imagine and understand the possible difference a single idea might make? (2011: xviii).</p>
<p class="noindent1"><i>Think with me</i>. This invitation, which echoes throughout the book, focuses attention on a fundamental condition and practice in democratic living. Extended fully, it proposes that the common mode of interaction between all participants in the public life of society should be founded on this invitation, which is also an injunction taking with complete seriousness the notion that a democratic society is the product of open conversations amongst its members across generations, whose diversity in terms of inheritance, education, knowledge, politics, wealth, cultures and languages does not diminish their equality as persons. There is nothing natural about such a mode of conversation,<sup><a id="note20" href="#note_20">20</a></sup> which challenges the highly structured exchanges typically carried on in processes like consultations between public institutions and citizen groups.<sup><a id="note21" href="#note_21">21</a></sup> As with any social relationship, the ethical and behavioural protocols of democratic conversation must be learned as part of the process of becoming an adult in and a citizen of a democratic society (Levine, 2007: 254).</p>
<p class="noindent1">“Think with me” invokes a scene inviting productivity of a fundamental and intangible, one might say priceless kind, the production of self- and social-knowledge from the engagement of minds in conversation. For Carr, this is the scene which establishes and sustains democratic societies.<sup><a id="note22" href="#note_22">22</a></sup> It invokes the moment when God speaks to Adam about his origins in Milton’s poem <i>Paradise Lost</i> in a way which encourages Adam to achieve by thought new kinds of self-understanding; the scene when Eve and Adam discuss the wisdom of their working alone in the Garden, a discussion unresolved when Adam declines to resolve their differences by asserting authority and Eve goes to discover for herself by experience the meaning of their situation (1674/1971: 8.250-643); and the negative of these examples, Eve’s discussion with Satan, when the skill and power of his words shapes her thinking until it becomes the echo of his (1674/1971: 9.192-375; 9.496-781). As the examples from <i>Paradise Lost</i> show, conversation, especially when it opens onto the unknown, is not safe, and may have destructive outcomes. But it founds a conception of society infinitely more complex than the current dominant origin scene, that of the exchange of goods, services and money in a market.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The current dominance of neoliberal, free market conceptions of society and government, in this context, are revealed for what they are, the position of a powerful segment of Western society (business and finance) which is readily exportable to non-democratic regimes because of its gross simplification of the nature of social exchange to the exchange of commodities for a price (but still wrapped in law written by the dominant partner as treaties, contracts, etc). To write this is not to deny the extraordinary importance in the historical increase in complexity of human societies of the invention of money as a means of representing value by quantifying it in certain exchange situations. But language was always already performing this function, enmeshing number in linguistic exchanges which incorporated cultural and locational values, as it does now; for example, in the discussions about “free trade” into which other domains of value, like human rights, minimum wages, labour conditions, traditional cultures, and sovereignty are inserted by those who recognise both the reductiveness of the conception of relations between people and peoples characteristic of these negotiations and the specific interests which seek to benefit by defining and delimiting their terms to the quantifiable. The point is not that negotiations between very different regimes, histories, and cultures do not require the finding of common ground on which to work out whatever form of relationship is under discussion; but it is that working to a lowest common denominator disguises the fact of power as an inevitable dimension of any exchange, not just the relative power of different jurisdictions and unequally distributed concentrations of wealth, but the ways in which these inequalities replay in political terms within jurisdictions, shifting internal power relations and pushing to the margins the process of historically evolving and continually revised consensus in a particular community, society or nation about the fundamental values, purposes and responsibilities of that society deriving from its inheritance and its transformation through on-going conversation amongst all of its citizens.</p>
<p class="noindent1">What, then, are the most humanly distinctive qualities which are both produced by and modelled in open conversations, in any of the settings in which people gather to serve and satisfy collective needs and purposes? The following list compiled by Carr identifies qualities which cannot be traded or commodified except by detaching them from their singular human embodiments and attaching them to tradable things (as advertising does). He writes that “we cannot download, curate, or collect any of the following things: altruism, artistry, attention, authenticity, cognition, collaboration, consideration, courage, critical thinking, curiosity, democracy, empathy, esteem, expectations, freedom of thought, generosity, hope, imagination, inquiry, integrity, kindness, patience, respect, responsibility, or wisdom” (2011, xiv). In the hard world<sup><a id="note23" href="#note_23">23</a></sup> of power politics, abuse of the law and electoral procedures, ruthless competition for scarce resources, massive accumulations of wealth, urban and environmental degradation, military, sexual and other kinds of violence, secrecy, addiction, crime, (expressions of our inhumanity), the scene of human exchange and possible transformation represented by civil conversation reminds us of another, better conception of ourselves.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s4.13"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-13"><i>5.3.3 Information and Communications (Media) Technologies</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">Each of us is a cultural producer, and each of us is a medium through which culture disseminates and reproduces. As with all other forms of media, the medium is not neutral in the transmission, but modifies what is transmitted to others. Without media for communication, human societies would not exist. Without sign systems and media technologies, human thought would be locked in individual minds; as Carr affirms, the primary purpose of communication is to bring each mind out of its inherent isolation and open it to other minds, present and past, in the process constituting a society (2011: 133-134). It is for this reason that the protocols governing communication in a society and access to the channels through which it can flow are such an immediate test of the extent to which its claim to be democratic can be tested.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As Milton recognised in respect of the communicational technologies of his time, to achieve the force and audibility necessary not only to be heard but to modify the current official account of what matters in and to government requires access to the technological infrastructures facilitating and managing social communication at any scale. It also requires the state to ensure that such access is universally available. The ability of individual minds to interact with the collected thought of all other human minds, which is the source of the power of thought, is blocked when people are denied, by poverty, class, education or state regulation the literacies and technologies required to access humanity’s thought and contribute to its expansion.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Modern media are the technological supplement which makes plain the always already technological character of acts of communication and the cultures in which they are embedded. The relationship is precisely defined by Debray when he writes that “the human miracle consists in <i>making meaning material</i>, the reverse side and paradoxical complement of the birth of intellect” (2000: 73). This position, a decisive characteristic of postmodernity, challenges the long history during which the medium has been treated as a neutral or transparent vehicle (99) in the process of communicating thought from one mind to another. At the heart of the processes which make innovation possible (and remind us that innovation is always already an attribute of any society which is committed to surviving over time) is what Giddens has called “mediated experience”. Tomlinson (1999) develops this concept with respect to modern media, showing that “the special, distinctive quality of mediated experience” is located by combining the “concept of mediation [as] the idea of overcoming distance” with a concept of “the medium itself <i>intervening</i> in the process, making its mark on the communication, producing qualitative changes in the experience of the thing communicated” (154-155; emphasis in the original).</p>
<p class="noindent1">As Bolter and Grusin (1999) demonstrate, “remediation” is the characteristic method by which media technologies innovate, both technologically and in the mediated experiences which they make available: “Digital visual media can best be understood through the ways in which they honor, rival, and revise linear-perspective painting, photography, film, television, and print. No medium today, and certainly no single media event, seems to do its cultural work in isolation from other media, any more than it works in isolation from other social and economic forces. What is new about new media comes from the particular ways in which they refashion older media and the ways in which older media refashion themselves to answer the challenges of new media” (15). In one respect, this is nothing more than a special case of Barnett’s theory of innovation, in which the emergent emerges through recombinations of the already known; in another, it identifies a fundamental aspect of cultural knowledge and the means by which that knowledge is revised and reformulated as social and environmental change occurs. Because culture is collective knowledge, formal and tacit, and that knowledge must circulate across the spaces and times in which a culture continues to exist, there can be no culture without mediating technologies, just as there would be no point to media technologies if there was nothing to mediate. When culture is thought of as the distinctive property of indigenous peoples, who are presumed to live in an original condition of unmediated experience (the oral tradition) or as a specific type of media content available for sale in a media market, the deep interaction between culture and media technologies becomes invisible to policy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In his analysis of the interdependence of technology and culture in human societies, Debray places particular emphasis upon the importance of institutions and media technologies in constituting and maintaining knowledge as a collective, not individual activity. By distinguishing between communication as the action of connecting individuals in the present and transmission as the action of connecting groups through time, Debray focusses attention on the stability of and capacity for change in meaning over time as together enabling culture, defined as “the repertory of forms, intuitive schemas, and corporealized memories every society makes available to its members” (2000: 52), to provide order and facilitate innovation in society. He affirms that “We transmit meanings so that the things we live, believe and think do not perish with <i>us</i> (as opposed to <i>me</i>). [...] productions of consciousness - religions, doctrines, ideologies, disciplines - [impinge] decisively on the course of material things. [...] The administration of signs and images has effects and stakes that are tangible, constraining, and at times violent” (3,9). The role of public sector agencies is given new significance when they are considered in these terms as highly active, fundamental components of the apparatus societies develop for conserving and modifying their accumulated resources of knowledge, and transmitting them to future generations. By “Perpetuating meaning [the] institution acts as a kind of registry or patent office, but rather than passively conserving its charges, it is never done revising, censuring, interpreting, and peddling them” (11). While all public sector agencies share these characteristics, it is the specifically denominated cultural agencies which have the most explicit responsibility for transmission as the process of reflexively engaging the present and the past in ways which are sensitive to communal and national differences, and to the diverse media in which collective knowledge is stored and transmitted. It is out of this kind of engagement with collective knowledge by people in institutional environments, Debray argues in a manner similar to H G Barnett, that innovation occurs: “Transmission withers on the vine when the present is taken as the only model. And innovation itself withers with it, scorn for the past being the greatest enemy of progress” (18). To approach media policy from within cultural policy is to seek to connect it deeply with and continue to advance what is distinctive about New Zealand’s cultural evolution. That such a step would not make sense in current policy settings is understandable, and so are the reasons why it should be taken. Debray argues that culture and technology are together necessary for innovation – “Without the quasi-chromosomal conjunction of cultural breeding ground with new technology, an innovation will not come forward and take over” (2000: 51) - even if, as themselves, they are strongly contrasted by being located in quite different policy domains. Reciprocally, it is not possible to have a serious cultural policy without having a media policy which starts with language as the exemplary (and most universally used and accessible) medium of cultural transmission, storage and knowledge formation, but also attends closely to the other material means of storage and transmission, including the institutions which sustain and regulate these social capacities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A good example of why both media technology and culture must be thought together in policy making for either is to be found in an adaptation of Francis Bacon’s conception of the imagination as nuntius. Hartley (2012: 185, 192) puts this in a striking way when he uses the metaphor to define a distinguishing attribute of humanity as “<i>Homo nuntius</i> or messaging humanity”. He writes that it “seems like a useful concept, because it requires attention to population-wide human characteristics, rather than to partial (elite-driven) or private systems, however large (like the internet), and their technological peculiarities”, and because it conceives of human identity as produced by “externally <i>networked</i> brains, linked primarily by language – dialogic, iterative, generative messaging in a coded system or semiosphere. […] although it returns attention to individual agency and identity, instead of focussing exclusively on industrial-scale systems and structures, the concept of <i>Homo nuntius</i> also allows for the agency of the network or networks used (i.e. for institutions) to be part of species adaptation.” Rather than accounting for the rapid uptake of digital communications devices by reference to clever design and skilful marketing (although there has been no lack of either), they gain their significance and power, like the postal system or telephony before them, from being able to place themselves in the middle between people wanting to send and receive messages at a distance. As Hartley notes, the possession and use of language is the common factor in messaging with any kind of technological device; he also affirms, like H. G. Barnett, that “Creativity is […] a population-wide attribute, it requires social networks, and its ‘product’ is the growth of knowledge, sometimes within a market environment, sometimes not. This is a radically democratic move” (48). But the common factors of language, creativity and media technologies have yet to be comprehended by the agencies of government.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Institutionally, government Ministries and national agencies which are now directly engaged in sustaining some part of the knowledge system of a democratic society are marked decisively by their historical origins, specifically in relation to the development of media technologies: libraries, archives and education focussed primarily on written language in print, both fictional and factual; museums focussed primarily on the accumulation of artefacts locating human knowledge of the natural and human world in their evolution through time, with commentary linking those objects to the totality of written knowledge about them; art galleries focussed primarily on the collection and display of pictorial and sculptural texts, also with linked commentary to written knowledge; universities were tied to specific forms of written record; cultural agencies were organised in relation to specific forms of artistic expression; radio and then television broadcasting followed print journalism in its mix of information and entertainment; classification and search functions – tables of contents, indexes and catalogues, and summaries of knowledge in encyclopedias, dictionaries and handbooks – evolved as the accumulations of knowledge expanded and its publics diversified. With new media technologies being invented from the early nineteenth century, the original conception of these culturally conserving institutions was expanded to include the full range of audio-visual media forms.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But this trajectory, of public institutions differentiating as new media forms evolved, which might have forced a perception that these institutions had something so important in common that they needed to be thought together in a new kind of cultural/knowledge policy, was disrupted by the development of digital ICTs with a quite different genealogy in technoscience and business. In order to reframe cultural knowledge and practice as producing a kind of capital asset capable of economic exploitation, the organisations most directly and historically associated with the conservation and creation of cultural knowledge had to be rediscovered as industries. This task was made easier by two factors: the modern evolution of mass media organisations using communications technologies, from printing through radio, telephony and film to computing, in which media technologies and increasingly private ownership of both them and the forms of content created with them and transmitted by their means became industrialised; and the late twentieth century (postmodern) remediation of all these technologies through the astonishingly rapid introduction of digital networked information and communications technologies, globally extensive, personally adaptable, and focussed on economic development. Unlike any previous communications technology, digital ICTs became both the means of new economic development and also the immediate end, in so far as enormous public and private investments in technological innovation, infrastructure and digitisation of pre-digital textual matter, in research, education and training, and in telecommunications, defence, finance, banking, retail and manufacturing were required to introduce and normalise digital ICTs as an integral part of the social fabric. It was a remarkable achievement by the private interests which benefitted financially most directly from this quite amazing process of social transformation, and by the techno-scientific research and development functions of the state, to bring governments on board through a discourse which blended research, education, innovation and economic development under the rubric of the information or knowledge society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">With digital remediation of the whole of the pre-digital archive possible (limited only by time, money and copyright), and with the new order of born-digital texts, including in such non-traditional forms as blogs, websites and social media, the first characterisation of the new postmodern order as “the knowledge economy” accurately locates the dynamic for these media technology developments in the private sector. Now that the first economically significant phase, marked by the wiring of the world, the development and sale of devices to connect to the wiring, and habituation to their use, has been largely accomplished, the next economically significant phase is marked by enthusiasm among media, telecommunications and IT companies for (neo-colonial) dominance over increasingly extensive parts of the semiotic territory of the semiosphere, because of the vastly extended capability of networked digital technologies to channel and hence control, measure and monetise the total flow of signs in all media forms and genres. The significance for culture can be succinctly indicated, consistently with Debray’s conception of technology. As a complement to the emphasis in advertising on technology impacts, presenting new digital technologies as irresistible forces for change, there was the iconic image of the very young child user, a new world and vacant territory with no baggage from the past which would complicate the rapid take-up of the new technologies. The conception that experience, memory and learning are obstacles to social, technological and economic innovation – the blank slate of the child’s mind being the ideal surface on which the ICT industry could write its version of the social – also serves to conceal the fact of the cultural and ideological conceptions designed into all media and cognitive technologies. Learning to use a digital device is usually to internalise and enact without reflection the culturally formed conceptions of human communication and of cognitive and social practice which have been designed into it.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Public cultural institutions have understood the logic of this situation, and have undergone major reconceptualisations of their missions, structures and the capabilities required of their professional work-force. This is an instance of Debray’s view that interpreting society through its media technologies involves two branches of analysis: one is diachronic, “asking by which networks of transmission and forms of organization a given cultural legacy was constituted”; the other is synchronic, asking how “the appearance of a new system or equipment modifies an institution, an established theory, or precodified practice” (99). The adaptation of cultural institutions in the context of media evolution includes both dimensions, but Debray’s two branches also highlight the nature of the massive fracture in networks of transmission which occurred late in the twentieth century in the evolution of cultural institutions. One consequence is that, as yet, it is barely possible to think together in a single policy framework the extraordinary diversity of recorded text-producing activity now possible as a result of the diversification of media technologies. Cunningham (2002: 61) highlights the problem in current conventional cultural policy when he affirms that “The arts, culture and creative industry sectors will need to get used to thinking of themselves as acting as part of a broader coalescence of interests encompassing the content-rich service industries such as education and learning, publishing, design, communications devices and e-commerce.” Even more than the industry sectors, it is governments which need to understand why this coalescence matters and why the cultural institutions (nationally and locally) are a critical part of it, in order to give form to a new cultural policy able to represent the public interest in this aspect of cultural evolution. Instead, the cultural institutions remain disconnected in policy, a critical disadvantage for any attempt to formulate a new cultural policy which would think together their purposes and the media technologies which provide the materials they work with, the infrastructures for their work, and the products they create in ways which would make sense of their fundamental cultural functions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Because of the centrality of education to my conception of the democratic state, it is worth reviewing the relationship between media technologies, culture and policy as it can be exemplified by the institution of education. In his study, <i>The Moment of Complexity: Emerging Network Culture</i>, Mark Taylor is able to envisage a new set of professionally empowering possibilities which acknowledges changed relationships and organisational forms throughout society by focussing on an assessment of how knowledge and its organisation changes with changing information and communications technologies. He notes that “it is beginning to seem clear that the university of the twenty-first century will be an intricate network or network of networks which is structured like a complex adaptive system. […] In the future, the curriculum will look more like a constantly morphing hypertext than a fixed linear sequence of prepackaged courses” (2001: 234). In an advanced learning environment, engagements with knowledge will be more like the processes for creating works of art as Luhmann has analysed them than the acquisition of blocks of certified knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Thinking of society as a function of its systems, processes and material means for creating, storing and disseminating knowledge of all kinds is a way towards policy making for a knowledge society in which digital ICTs connect people globally and which is comprised of “complex adaptive networks” by means of which every kind of knowledge can in principle interact, that is, a conception more like an education system, or a university, or a global library than an economy:</p>
<p class="quote">When extended to cultural processes, the notion of complex adaptive networks illuminates the ways in which symbols, concepts, myths, and theories transform noise into information, which can be organized in meaningful patterns to inform thinking and guide action. Effective patterns of meaning require a new architecture of complexity, which simultaneously embodies and articulates the logic of networking (16-17).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Another instance is the defining structural form and its materialisation by which Taylor distinguishes the postmodern from the modern, that is, the network in contrast to the grid, examples of which he takes from urban architecture.</p>
<p class="quote">By examining the architecture of Mies, Venturi, and Gehry, it becomes possible to trace the movement from industrial society, through media culture, to network culture. This trajectory suggests that the moment of complexity can be understood in terms of the shift from a world structured by grids to a world organized like networks (20).</p>
<p class="noindent1">He elaborates on these ideas<sup><a id="note24" href="#note_24">24</a></sup> in a consideration of what the full shift to educational work in digital media might mean:</p>
<p class="quote">If the wired world is a new frontier, it is unlike any we have known in the past. Instead of exploring a space that is already present, it is necessary to create an environment whose complexity is virtually unimaginable. […] The new educational environment that is emerging is more like a growing organism than an industrial factory. The ecology of this mutating landscape is as fragile as the ecology of the minds that create and are created by it. Viral webs and networks must be carefully cultivated. When attempting to support and coordinate the activities of many diverse individuals and groups, it is important to make every effort to avoid the pitfalls of highly centralized and hierarchical organizations. Wherever possible, the correlative principles of decentralization and distribution serve as guides for practice. In contrast to traditional business, education, and broadcast models, the creation of a decentralized and distributed network facilitates many-to-many communication among both providers and users. […] Unplanned interactions create the condition for the emergence of creative innovation (267-268).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The policy framework needed to encompass the implications of such a social transformation of the means for access to learning is to be found in a new cultural policy, because it is only policy grounded in the actuality of knowledge in mediated culture which can be capable of understanding and managing what Taylor refers to as the fragile ecology of the semiosphere as the space of interactivity between minds and objectified knowledge. There is little space within educational policy framed by the economy and business interests for considering the institution of education, together with its students and teachers, in ecological terms as fragile organisms living and thinking in a “mutating landscape” characterised by “unplanned interactions”. A cultural-technological rather than a techno-scientific paradigm for framing educational policy is necessary for the implications of postmodernity to be grasped and inform the work of government.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s4.14"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-14"><i>5.3.4 Cultural Policy and Openness</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">Recognising the deep implications of the intimate linkages between culture and technologies of all kinds (but here specifically media technologies) for thinking about democratic knowledge and innovation as outcomes of thought emerging anywhere in a society and communicated through the networks available to any citizen highlights several conditions underpinning the kind of (mediated) conversations which constitute the vitality of democratic societies and their ability to serve and fulfil public interests, and further specify the orientation of cultural policy for the education state. The common factor is openness.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Openness concerns public access to a society’s resources of knowledge, to the communications media through which knowledge and conversation circulate and public opinion is shaped, and the ability of any citizen to contribute to decision-making and to understand the reasons why decisions are taken (Peters, 2010: 252, 255-256). For these social means and resources to be used by citizens, it is obvious that they must have education and experience sufficient to make productive use of them. It is therefore a fundamental obligation upon a democratic state that all of its citizens should have access to the kinds of learning required to contribute competently to public decision-making processes, using whatever communications media are commonly employed in such processes, and to use in a creative way whatever segment of knowledge matters to them. Clearly, the more completely a society’s knowledge (and especially new knowledge) resources are owned by private interests, and the means of access to this knowledge are controlled through ownership of the communications channels making access and circulation of knowledge throughout society possible, the more restricted will be citizen participation in the governance of society and the sources of innovation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The issue of open access to information has become central to every aspect of discussion about information and communications systems in part because the invention of the Internet offered the prospect of redefining the role of global systems from the perspective of the public interest<sup><a id="note25" href="#note_25">25</a></sup>, while also offering the possibility of total control by private interests of every aspect of the systems facilitating the conservation and exchange of information, including all forms of learning, economic activity, the development of new knowledge, decision-making at all levels of government, and political debate.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Several strands in recent thinking about knowledge institutions help extend this notion of the education state in its relation to knowledge work and the knowledge economy. The challenge to the private ownership of knowledge and the top-down conception of innovation can be succinctly represented though three concepts: the knowledge commons, the gift economy, and engagement. What these concepts share is a fundamental conviction that knowledge and information are inherently public resources, not only because public funding generates much new knowledge but because the open exchange of knowledge on which democratic governance and social evolution depend cannot be accomplished by globalised markets based on private ownership and competition. As Bollier argues, “The commons fills a theoretical void by explaining how significant value can be created and sustained outside of the market system. […] The matrix for calculating the public good is not a narrow economic index like the gross domestic product or a company’s bottom line, but instead looks to a richer, more qualitative and humanistic set of criteria that are not easily measured, such as moral legitimacy, social consensus and equity, transparency in decision making, and ecological sustainability, among other concerns” (Bollier, 2007: 29; See Peters, 2010, Cabrera, 2012). In other words, public policies for knowledge and communications need to be formulated in an educational and democratic rather than an economic framework, one in which the state conceives of itself as a trustee, or kaitiaki (guardian) of the public interest<sup><a id="note26" href="#note_26">26</a></sup> and facilitates practices which encourage engagement by its citizens in shaping their future.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The question is not whether the public interest should be expressed through public ownership, although the role of public ownership needs to be assessed as a positive dimension of any economy rather than in terms of the private sector’s self-conception and as the gap filler compensating for market failure. The issue is, like everything else in policy, one of being able to anticipate social futures through the best use of the best knowledge available to government, and to clarify the best mix of public and private in a particular state of society. But my own view is unambiguous on one point of principle (which is clearly also a political position): that a nation claiming to be democratic which does not define the parameters <i>in the name of all of its publics</i> for the management and on-going evolution of its critical infrastructures – such as energy, transport, health, communication, education – can at best be a shadow democracy in which its citizens will not enjoy the freedom to decide collectively on its future.<sup><a id="note27" href="#note_27">27</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">An important study which brings the three concepts together is Kenway et al’s demonstration of the way in which the knowledge economy, as currently formulated in public policy and state action, suppresses but cannot erase the existence of other economies, defined as the risk, gift, libidinal and survival economies. These spectral economies float around but are not engaged by the policy discourses and decision-making of Parliament and government, even though the gift and survival economies are of particular significance for the well-being and operation of democratic societies. The gift economy places in the foreground “three central obligations that the knowledge economy conveniently denies: to give, to receive, and to repay. The knowledge economy is a grasping economy, its only obligation is to acquire without constraint and reciprocity, and, therefore, it ignores the gift-like qualities of knowledge”; the survival economy enacts the ecological paradigm of indigenous knowledge: “premised on notions of complexity, respect, reciprocity and responsibility – it involves restorative justice.” (Kenway et al, 2006: 122, 115; Kuokkanen, 2007; Waitangi Tribunal, 2011). A good example of the revaluation of current policy which would be impelled by these considerations is the so-called “burden of an aging population”, if that population were to be conceptualised and valued in terms of the gift and survival economies, and if intergenerational relations within the institution of the family were understood to be as crucial to the sustaining of society over time as are society’s cultural institutions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Because of the present marginalising in public policy of those cultural institutions in democratic societies which most provide for and represent the extraordinary richness and diversity of human minds and lives in time and place, making this connection between them and the family as a multi-generational institution demonstrates clearly the impoverished conceptions of democracy which currently characterise the priorities governing western democracies. While globalised information systems appear to have in principle made global knowledge globally available, and scientific research appears to have made universally valid knowledge in principle universally accessible, an education state will recognise that knowledge and innovation are locally grounded in its citizens. Gibbons writes that innovation “remains a local phenomenon and serves as a constant reminder that globalization turns on differences in the sentiments of a population, in its particular institutional structures that are designed to achieve collective purposes, and in the cultures that give meaning and value to the decisions taken. As societies differ in their various historically endowed modes and capabilities, they will imitate, adapt and diffuse knowledge solutions differently” (Gibbons, 2004: 97). The sources of learning for innovation must be heterogeneous, multimodal, critical, engaging many kinds of knowledge in the way these are engaged in the network structures of fictional narrative or hypertext rather than the formal structures of traditional textbooks or bureaucratic policy documents.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the local haunts the universal, the family haunts social policy, crime haunts the legitimate economy, and the “social network ‘swarm’” (Hartley, 2012: 47) haunts expert knowledge, teaching also haunts research. Research-based innovation is highly valued, but the role of teaching as a powerful means of generating new knowledge and initiating innovation, especially innovation leading to new social and cultural forms and practices and sustaining civil society, is not. For the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences (2004: 18-19), “Teaching is the most prolific form of knowledge dissemination. […] In the classroom, professors can and must exhibit the values of living in a free and open society of critical discourse and mutual respect.”<sup><a id="note28" href="#note_28">28</a></sup> The concept of engagement as applied to higher education institutions gives priority less to supranational linkages in research than to the complex of social relations which become visible when a tertiary institution conceives of its research and teaching in its local context (Fitzgerald et al, 2012: 231-232; Levine, 2007: 261-262; Shellard and Craig, 2012), an orientation consistent with the practices of schools when they are freed to attend to the educational needs of their localities rather than locking them into globalised standards regimes<sup><a id="note29" href="#note_29">29</a></sup>. It also foregrounds the relation between teacher and learner as an ethical relation between singular minds in a specific place and time, the classroom being a critical site in which the principles of democracy can and should be acquired and experienced first hand. In this respect, the classroom can exemplify democratic governance in practice as Bevir (2010: 272-273) has described it, a place in which learning how to do it is practiced using the resources each person brings to the classroom: “the possibility of local reasoning and situated agency entail a creativity that means rules, norms, and institutional and social trajectories are contingent and contested. An emphasis on culture and agency […] may give us hope for a pluralist and representative democracy built around diverse openings and support for citizens to develop voice, enter dialogues, and rule themselves.” The terms used by Kenway et al to characterise the survival economy- respect, reciprocity and responsibility – are clearly critical protocols framing the social process of entering into dialogue with others and echo Carr’s conception of the mode of engagement required for productive and mutually enhancing conversation, of which teaching is a distinctive mode and democratic governance, nationally and internationally, is its most complex form.</p>
<p class="noindent1">From another perspective, Raboy, Bernier, Sauvageau, and Atkinson point out that “Traditional cultural practices, mass-mediated communication, and public education have become intertwined, through networks of communication and information resources which are also fundamental to global commerce. […] The omnipresence of mass-media and their capacity for instantaniety confers on them a special status with regard to the exercise of citizenship and democratic public life” (1994: 39). No cultural policy can now ignore the issue of ownership of mass media content and the channels through which it is disseminated, given the critical function of these media in the transmission of cultural knowledge and the operation of postmodern societies. Through the same channels can flow both global and local knowledge; what the ratio between them might be is a function of the ownership and economic role of the channels. If media policy were to be firstly part of cultural policy, the role of the media in facilitating and sustaining cultural transmission and hence civil society would be foregrounded. Their role in education and democratic life would be a function of the distinctive characteristics of those dimensions of society, rather than being defined by commercial models and interests. Their role in innovation, besides innovations in their own modes and forms of operation, would be, for example, not primarily to project images of New Zealand to New Zealanders to secure a national identity and to the world to brand products<sup><a id="note30" href="#note_30">30</a></sup> which otherwise might not be easily differentiated from others on the world market, but to provide as much access as possible to a national conversation the content of which is what New Zealanders are thinking and doing about the future of New Zealand as a specific site of cultural innovation.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s4.15"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-15">6. The public sector, and public value, in the education state</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Human societies can deal more productively with changing circumstances if their members can participate in the on-going evaluation and discussion of goals, values, models and beliefs as a collective conversation. To be effective, this conversation needs to be open to and include all the agencies and institutions of a society, at all of its levels, and it is the means by which people and groups differentiated by history, culture and degrees of social power can negotiate their on-going relations. At the centre of such a process in a democracy are two agents: the informed citizen who acquires self-knowledge and social responsibility in a variety of interrelated contexts - family, locality, work, leisure, culture, society, education, economy, nation – which are now penetrated as never before by global influences; and the institutions of government. For both agents, these contexts are dynamic, unstable and productive of destructive crises as well as constructive social innovation. The knowledge relevant to effective governance – by which I mean understanding societies in action and assisting their constructive and purposeful evolution - is diverse and no single discipline or method or agency can assume priority over any other.<sup><a id="note31" href="#note_31">31</a></sup> But a key actor in these processes is the informed citizen in his or her role as a public sector official, a singular location of cultural knowledge acting in collaboration with others to propose ways of thinking through the deep challenges any society faces in attempting to become a better version of itself.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Government is an institution of institutions, a system of systems, a network of networks, with singular, embodied minds - rule-performing (and rule-abrogating), knowledge interpreting and socially transforming - providing its vital energies. It is a conventional critique of state bureaucracies that they are unimaginative, bound by conventions, inward-looking, distanced from the publics they are supposed to serve. But all institutions and organisations (pubic and private) are open to such a critique; so it is only from a private sector political and ideological perspective that public sector agencies can be supposed to be uniquely in need of reform. As Palmer (2013: 695) argues, the “four pillars on which the success of western societies was built are representative government, free markets, the rule of law and civil society. These institutions have deteriorated”. This trend has to be reversed if twenty-first century democratic societies are to flourish rather than decline into deeply stratified societies in which wealth is the only measure of personal and social accomplishment.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is not inevitable that the foundational public institutions of a democratic society should be constrained by inherent conservatism or party ideology; to serve effectively the interests of civil society, which are much broader than those of the market, requires an openness to a society’s possible futures and a clear mandate to assess and make publicly accessible the kinds of knowledge on which competent and collective decision-making in a nation’s interests depends.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Since it is also apparent that the private sector needs the public sector (public funds, regulation, social infrastructures of all kinds, from law to systems of exchange to public health and the security of citizens), it would clearly alter thinking about the purpose of government if state agencies, like all other public assets, were to be considered as a wellspring of social energy and collective knowledge, an early warning system anticipating the future and constituting the on-going possibility of the existence of a society and its markets in the same way that culture does. Innovation is not the special competence of the private sector, as policy formulation seems to assume; it is a competency of a special kind of society, one capable of thinking through its heritage, its cultural diversity and its social values towards its possible futures and of enacting that thinking through representative institutions.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s4.16"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-16">6.1 Public value</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The downsizing of the public sector which has been such a marked feature of neoliberalism in action is itself an outcome of the pursuit of a mode of thinking which privileges private enterprise in its globalising, corporate form and the economic model intrinsic to it over the public domain, public institutions, local societies, economies and cultures. To limit the capabilities of public agencies, especially in those dimensions of the work of the state not directly involved with commerce or the military-industrial complex, and to divert public funds to private uses, strikes at the roots of the possibility of further evolution of forms of democratic social governance. The key role of public sector agencies, since it cannot be a role of the market, is to protect, nurture and continually interpret democratic principles so that elected governments make decisions with the best advice in the public interest and according to public preferences. Furthermore, as Benington (2011: 49) points out, “Governments, dictated by electoral cycles, inevitably tend to focus on the shorter term, but public managers also have a responsibility to focus on the longer-term public interest, and to act as guardians of the public sphere in the interest of future generations yet unborn.” At present, as has been widely noted in this phase of neoliberal downsizing of the public sector, this guardianship responsibility has become limited to preventing risks to the tenure of the current political party or parties in power.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The work public sector agencies carry out is knowledge work, and its scope is the whole of society, the principles and practices by which it is governed at all levels, and the history and future of its evolution in a particular territory. Public sector agencies are placed at a critical intersection between global and local flows of knowledge and innovation, especially democratic social innovation (Kelly, Mulgan, and Muers, 2002: 5-6); one of their tasks, like that of a democratic society’s universities, is to interpret world knowledge through the lens of a particular national community for its citizens to use. Their principal accountability should be to the public, through well-defined and openly formulated conceptions of public value (Benington and Moore: 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent1">How this concept could be applied to the criteria for evaluation of public sector organisations in the United Kingdom was delineated in <i>Creating Public Value: An analytical framework for public service reform</i> (Kelly, Mulgan and Muers, 2002). It refers to the reciprocal nature of the relation between citizens and their government in a democratic society, noting that “The fact that public value can be produced as a joint effort between citizens and government is particularly salient for outcomes. Government alone cannot deliver lower crime and better health: social norms of behaviour are critical” (16). The key premise is that the value created by government is determined by citizens’ preferences for trustworthy government, due process, and the quality of decision-making, and that those preferences are formed in immediate social relations with others and public debate about a society’s goals. The report affirms that “Good government requires citizens and their representatives to continually revise shared values and objectives through a process of public deliberation” (7) and claims that “Recognition has grown that, in addition to well functioning markets, successful liberal democracies require strong and effective governments able to guarantee fair treatment, equal opportunities, access to a range of key services, and to act as a steward of a country’s interests within and across generations” (5-6). From a perspective after the 2008 Global Financial Crash, this statement invokes hopefulness more than a progressively accomplished rebalancing; but it nonetheless states a critical difference between the political and official components of the democratic state. In particular, its inclusion of stewardship (or guardianship, “kaitiakitanga”) requires a professional function and mindset which works in longer cycles and to different authorities than the electoral cycle. The report also observes that the creation of public value is not just the work of public sector agencies: “Voluntary and community associations, business and professional and citizen groups will all play a key role in the achieving the goals of public policy” (6).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The dimension of the work of government which is most complex, most political, and most directly linked to the humanities concerns cultural knowledge and moral values. Issues invoking these forms of knowledge are also the issues which most directly engage with citizens’ conflicting conceptions of their society’s purposes and the inherited principles and values which provide continuity in the conduct of social living. <i>Creating Public Value</i> argues that “One of the most important but perhaps least tangible benefits produced by government involves the creation of social <i>norms</i>, codes of behaviour and laws. Government produces benefits by helping set the rules of the game for civil society. It does this in a number of ways: for instance by using its moral authority to reduce socially destructive forms of behaviour (avoiding drunk driving), promoting socially beneficial forms of behaviour (charitable donation) and giving legal recognition to private acts that generate public benefit (adoption)” (17). While this beneficial function can be a source of hope with respect to the functioning of the institutions governing democratic societies, not least that decisions by government are knowledgable formulations of the mind of the governed, each of the examples points to an ever present question: in whose interests is the moral authority of the state exercised? This question has deep significance because the technocratic discourse of “evidence-based” decision making does not succeed in operating outside of the moral dimensions of any issue except by suppressing those dimensions.<sup><a id="note32" href="#note_32">32</a></sup> Furthermore, the phrase “helping set the rules of the game for civil society” implies that a major (but not sole) responsibility of government is to define the boundaries of the meaning of the term civil in “civil society”; because those boundaries change over time, an education state would approach such change as a collectively conscious but not prescriptive process to be carried forward by education and learning in all its diverse forms. In both cases, whether the state is perceived to perform these functions on behalf of a powerful segment or of the whole society is critical to that society’s ability to achieve constructive change. In the case of the whole society, it is also a test of the democratic credentials of a government. For Douzinas (2010: 70-71), “Politics is fast morphing into a type of market economics legitimized by humanistic moralism. As an economic operation, politics has become the terrain where negotiations and compromises are worked out, accounted for and aggregated between groups and classes that have accepted the overall social balance, distribution and inequality.” In such a settlement, the powers of the state become coopted by and serve the interests of specific social sectors; challenging such a settlement has always been central to the struggle to extend democratic practice.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One sign of an orientation to public value is the commitment to open access to government information. The work of government is carried out by producing, evaluating and conserving data, information and knowledge about and on behalf of society and its citizens, ideally in their best interests and for their benefit. The public sector, in other words, at national and local levels, is in organisational terms the single most important creator of knowledge relevant to the state and conduct of a nation over time, and hence to the building of the nation’s collective memory, as well as a source of information of immediate social and economic value. Archives New Zealand is formally charged with conserving and making accessible the national memory of the decisions and acts of government, but in performing this function it provides a valuable perspective on the knowledge work carried out by the public sector. Specifically, it is to be done on behalf of the public interest in the first instance, with the needs of the future as well as the present informing that work.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The facilitating of open access to government information is consistent with the view expressed by Jacques Derrida when he writes that there is “no political power without control of the archive, if not of memory. Effective democratization can always be measured by this essential criterion: the participation in and access to the archive, its constitution, and its interpretation” (1995: 4). The critical point for my purpose here is that an open and collectively built archive is associated with a fundamental characteristic of a certain kind of society, democratic society, which has been the goal (however contested) of social and political evolution in Western Europe for the past four centuries, and which is intimately linked with (but not subservient to) the evolution of a modern (and now postmodern) economy focussed on the creation, conservation and dissemination of knowledge, the city, industry and the exchange of goods and services.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The strangeness of open access as a public value is everywhere evidenced by the tendency of new regimes to attempt to return to a cultural ground zero through the destruction of languages, documents and objects storing and communicating foreign knowledge and values, whether in the contest over truth by religions and ideologies, or the contest over territory by states and empires. A local reminder that an open access system for government information requires new learning by citizens and government officials is provided by a recent report of the Office of the Ombudsman on the operation of the Official Information Act.<sup><a id="note33" href="#note_33">33</a></sup> It is also evidenced by the increasing pressure from states on journalists and media organisations to publish only officially scripted information. By contrast, a broadcasting system which emphasises public value would move in exactly the opposite direction. As Horner and Hutton (2011: 113) put it, “public value broadcasting, instead of mainly measuring audience ratings, would foster cultured and knowledgable viewers and listeners, whose judgments would be included in the assessment of performance and public value added.”</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s4.17"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-17">6.2 Knowledge</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Stuart Cunningham (1994, 6} has observed of public sector officials that “Often they are the most knowledgeable and canny of anyone on issues needing public debate and publicity, but cannot themselves initiate, or be seen to initiate, such debate. […] The speaking position of the academic as an independent researcher and commentator in this context has strategic value for the commissioners and users of cultural policy studies, however much of these findings are then redeployed as pawns in the four dimensional game that is policy formation and implementation.” His distinguishing between the (relative) institutional freedom of the academic to speak in public and the more limiting institutional protocols governing officials makes an important point while also linking them professionally as equals in espect of their modes of engagement with knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">But the recent move to require public sector organisations to supply advice conforming to the political convictions of a party in government fails to acknowledge the latter attribute and is absolutely destructive of the rationale of the public sector in a democratic society. The work carried out by public sector organisations, as with universities, is funded by the public to meet a need which members of the public cannot meet for themselves, which is the creation, acquisition and evaluation of the best available knowledge for thinking about the present state and situation of the nation and its future possibilities. The array of public sector organisations and agencies divides the I-space differently from the array of a university’s disciplines; the latter are oriented towards the global context of knowledge work, whereas the former give institutional form to a nation’s political and cultural history, its distinctive social evolution and its on-going (re)interpretation. Having two strong but differently oriented institutional formations focussed on knowledge work in the national interest is productive when each engages with the other on the common ground of the nation’s future.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is not surprising that, by dissociating universities from the public sector and trying to treat them as corporations, the role of the public sector in the creation of a knowledge society appropriate to a nation of New Zealand’s size and capabilities has become almost entirely obscured. It is remarkable that, in all of the policy documents and reports that I have read by government agencies aimed at implementing knowledge society conceptions, their role has never been discussed. In both kinds of institution the dominance of risk and mechanisms for absorbing it have exercised a predominantly conservative effect on their productive work on behalf of the people of New Zealand, in the evaluation of global knowledge and its relevance to New Zealand, new knowledge creation, and advice to government at all levels. The displacement of the public by the Minister as the client for public sector services has had a particularly limiting effect.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rather than downsizing the public sector as the only goal, a new model of the public sector relevant to its actual importance for a small nation like New Zealand as a first-world, democratic society needs to be formulated and change based on it. In my view, the public sector is critical (perhaps much more than in other, larger societies) in the nation’s capacity to keep up with the flows of new knowledge in which it is enmeshed but lacks a larger nation’s capacity to assess. It has been recurrently observed<sup><a id="note34" href="#note_34">34</a></sup> that the New Zealand public, through the government, provides a disproportionate percentage of the funds for new knowledge creation. I believe that this state of affairs is endemic and will not change because of New Zealand’s history, remoteness and small scale on every measure. This is only the most obvious area in which the role of the public sector as the principal national means of creatively adapting to these inherent limitations must be reassessed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Like a university, the public sector taken as a whole constitutes a fundamental part of a society’s knowledge resources and the expertise required for their application to human and environmental betterment, and the way that the whole spectrum of knowledge is divided among its various agencies is directly related to the understanding of public priorities and values among those responsible for their administration and effectiveness. New Zealand lacks a national university and will never be able to afford one (except, perhaps, by turning its competing academic corporations into a multi-campus institution). But, at the national level, government ministries are chartered with the responsibility to think nationally, and to advise the nation through the government of the day and through open access provisions about how New Zealand can best position itself in order to maintain and advance those social and economic attributes necessary to retain and further develop its self-conception as a first-world, democratic society. Very little, if any, of this work can or will be done by the private sector, and yet effective development of the economy by business depends on having access to this more broadly conceived knowledge. Other countries deal in part with this matter through an array of think tanks located across the political spectrum (but still more typically aggregated on the right-wing side of that spectrum because that is where their financing mostly originates) and civil society organisations. Just as New Zealand lacks the private sector funding for research, so it lacks that sectorʻs funding for a spread of think tank organisations representative of the political spectrum. The only set of institutions with the potential to serve this purpose in New Zealand is to be found in the public sector. But to think this way is also to reframe some of the current assumptions about the role of the public sector, and the relation between the public sector and the government.</p>
<p class="noindent1">No longer is the human person the representative figure of the democratic state, however strongly ancient totalitarian or absolutist self-conceptions are persistently re-discovered by modern rulers; instead, technocratic organisation and regulation displaces any personification with textual abstraction, even if its structures and processes are constantly undermined by the human surplus of perception, motivation, belief, and knowledge brought by those whose vitality inhabits the apparatuses of government and gives them their semblance of life. Bevir (2010: 272) has argued that “An emphasis on culture and agency encourages us to explore the diverse meanings and traditions embodied in governance, revealing its contingent, contested, and complex trajectories. Following this line of thought brings into the foreground the distinctive cultural practices which are manifested in the relations between persons in come organisations, and the productive surplus which officials bring into their work.” Their being singular minds and nodal points in networks, exceeding any organisational rule because they, like the organisations themselves, inhabit the I-space as a networked cognitive space constituted by multiple formations and diverse linkages, is the actual source of the possibility of innovation in public sector agencies. The singular mind is always already interactive with and substantially informed by the collective mind of humanity and its multitudinous fractions, which intersect uniquely in that mind and locally in diverse kinds of civil society group formations where claims to know and understand the human situation in that place and universally are made.<sup><a id="note35" href="#note_35">35</a></sup> The effects of combining and permuting world knowledge in a specific time and place are unpredictable and the primary source of all kinds of innovation, as well as all kinds of reduction and restriction, depending on whether it is public or private, democratic or autocratic, interests which frame decision-making in a particular group, community or nation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In principle as well as in fact there should be no restriction of the kinds of knowledge which inform government; all kinds of knowledge can and should be informing public decision-making. But such openness to the whole of public thought requires time, real consultative processes by people educated to listen before speaking and both free and willing to look beyond the already known and taken for granted. In a system of government under pressure by narrow time frames, a hegemonic knowledge system privileging the techno-sciences, urgent demands by powerful economic interests, and a media system increasingly obedient to those interests (Laurens, 2015), it is hardly surprising that so much official talk about innovation and creativity merely circulates the policy currency of the time. As I have argued throughout, to think about innovation and creativity as a foundation for postmodern democratic social and economic development requires an extraordinary (impossible?) widening of the frame within which public policy thinking is now constrained. If it is foreign to current conventional thinking in law and modern humanities to understand legal work and humanistic knowledge as founded in and creative of fiction, how much more will that be the case in a government for which valid knowledge is that produced only by techno-scientific methods?</p>
<p class="noindent1">Public policy has to acknowledge overtly the moral complexities embedded in public decision-making, the way in which moral positions which are good in the abstract clash with one another between people and in the same person depending on the situation requiring assessment and decision, the group(s) to which people belong, their socio-economic positioning, and different cultural histories. Policy making is thus a rhetorical process of evaluating and negotiating arguments being made with different kinds of knowledge, from different positions in society; it is enmeshed in power relations, governmental, bureaucratic, and interest group. In an education state it would be practised as an educative process, part of the larger engagement of expertise with public knowledge as a mutual activity of reciprocal learning – the expert from the public’s experience, the public from the expert’s formal knowledge – with the aim of diminishing the distorting effect of power as much as possible. The process remains rhetorical because, even if public agreement can be accomplished on the facts or the truth of an issue of public importance there is unlikely to be only one conception of what might be the appropriate response to that knowledge and hence one simple formulation of public policy. For example, the fact of poverty or of crime is hardly disputed, but what should be done about the fact in either case is an intensely political, value-laden question. The best any democratic society can do is ensure through the means available to it that all citizens have access to the sources for forming an adequate understanding of the issues (that is, learning) and of shaping a public agreement through the appropriate forms and levels of government. The widespread cynicism about the point of participating in consultation processes as a citizen points to one aspect of the complex reality of life in a democratic society, that the knowledge – formal, informal and tacit - professed by a citizen is, in its unique formation as self-consciousness, experienced as differentiating that person from all others. The task for responsible democratic governance is to respect that difference in all of its levels and processes while ensuring that, because there can never be complete collective agreement on any issue, the established forms of public decision-making are also respected. It is obvious that such an approach does not sit comfortably with the current (and one-sided business) focus of government on resolving short-term economic issues along preset party lines.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The public sector policy writer is also positioned as a participant, not a neutral observer or recorder, making a claim to some expert knowledge, but also responsible to the diverse publics that state bureaucracies in a democracy are supposed to represent. The policy writer’s task is clearly different from the Member of Parliament’s task, even though both are responsible for representing public opinion; in crucial respects it is a heavier responsibility because the policy writer is required to take into account the fact of political differences while attempting to provide the best formulation of an issue derived from all the knowledge from both expert and public sources. It cannot therefore be the responsibility of public sector agencies to present policy which already conforms to the political views of the governing party/ies; bureaucratic advice should be interpreted politically by the government and argued out in Parliament. Not least because the public sector is funded by the public, its officials should have as their primary responsibility the formulation of the best accounts relevant to an issue as it manifests itself in the distinctive context of a particular nation or region, so that the public is fully informed about what is at stake in the decisions to be taken.<sup><a id="note36" href="#note_36">36</a></sup> In this way, public sector agencies assume their true importance in association with the tertiary sector as sifters, evaluators and disseminators of world knowledge on behalf of their publics, a critical function especially for small nations immersed in the global flows of new knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This account of the role of public sector policy-making assumes conceptions of care for and comprehensive understanding of the distinctive characteristics of a specific nation-state, and of a separation of powers between officials and the government in Parliament which allows full access to the public of relevant knowledge for decision-making on the public’s behalf while at the same time ensuring that a decision to act on behalf of the nation remains in Parliament. But making public sector agencies subordinate to the political interests of the parties for the time in government means that decision-making based on the best accounts of available knowledge is deeply compromised, and the public interest in good government on behalf of the public is side-lined. Decisions and actions on behalf of a nation’s citizens can never be taken without being framed by their values and histories; but these, too, need to be made explicit, and Parliament is the national site for the temporary resolution of their differences in a decision to act at a specific moment on a specific issue. However, the time-frame for decision-making in a state should be much longer than the timeframe for decision-making in the market, although it is the latter which currently determines the former and also explains why so much new law fails to accomplish what was claimed for it. A public of citizens in a democracy cannot become educated in respect of new issues facing them in the shorthand way a public of consumers in a market can become “educated” by advertising.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In so far as a role of the state is regulation of society on behalf of its citizens, it will always be under pressure by interest groups whose time-frame for decisions is short. This situation imposes an even greater responsibility on public sector agencies to provide informed frameworks for thinking (at local, regional and national levels of government) which can anticipate short-term demands and locate them within broader public agreements about the longer-term directions and aims for the society.<sup><a id="note37" href="#note_37">37</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s4.18"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-18">7. Law, humanities and democracy to come</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">From early in the development of the Humanities Society and formalised in the Research Policy (1996), the conception of the humanities included law, even though most lawyers (academic and in practice) would not have considered such a claim of much value. Although it had remained usual at my university for students graduating in Law to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree as well, the traditional humanities core of the BA had come to include the Social Sciences, and it is now increasingly common for degrees in Commerce, Information Technology and Science to complement the Law degree. So the creation of the field of Law and the Humanities at roughly the same time was another sign for the times, as the traditional links between the study of law and of the humanities had been diluted and other knowledges of greater perceived value, especially economics, were taking the place of the traditional humanities disciplines. It was clearly not that Law was, like the humanities, becoming marginal as a mode of knowledge in postmodern democratic societies. Quite the opposite. It was and is providing the critical technology for managing competitive relations in global and local markets, generating wealth, governing behaviour between persons, organisations and states, and creating supranational bodies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a> set out the basis for reconstituting an ancient association between the law and the traditional modes of European learning which founded the humanities in the textual character of the objects created as laws and the processes by which they are interpreted and re-written under the pressure of changing contexts of reading and decision-making. But, as this section will demonstrate, this position can only be a starting point. By itself, as Milton noted in the epigraph to <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter Three</a>, writing laws accomplishes very little. For laws to affect social practices in the ways intended by the lawmakers, they must be understood, consented to, and open to amendment from critique and experience by an informed population; or they must be backed by force. The latter option is the default position everywhere, not least because the urgency to make laws is quite incompatible with the time needed for understanding and evaluating their meaning and implications. Public understanding of the law becomes unimportant when lawmaking serves predominantly the immediate interests of social elites.<sup><a id="note38" href="#note_38">38</a></sup> One of the distinguishing marks of an education state would be that its approach to lawmaking would be a public, educative and fully consultative process (what might be called “slow law”).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The proper complexity of the issues raised by rethinking together the law and the humanities is explored and presented in a very important and substantial collection of essays which engages all of the critical lines of thought with which I am concerned. In <i>Law and the Humanities: An Introduction</i> the editors present the collection as a review of a field of enquiry the beginnings of which were marked by the inauguration of the <i>Yale Journal of Law and the Humanities</i> in 1988. Several of the authors offer accounts of the evolution of the humanities, (Douzinas, 2010: 49-51; Sarat, Anderson, and Frank, 2010: 2-11; Shoemaker, 2010: 522); but one statement in particular brings together in a sentence the twin issues of the nature of knowledge in the humanities and the law, and the changing terms on which knowledge is currently valued in government and business. Winter (2010: 101) proposes that “[Humanities scholarship’s] methodological commitment to an interpretive conception of ‘truth’ as that which emerges from the complex of human meaning, purpose, and goals places it beyond the facile objectivity of the more technical discourses that dominate legal studies today.” The latter point is made bluntly in the Introduction, where the editors reiterate a foundational motive for developing the field, that is, “a self-consciously programmatic response to the pervasive influence of law and economics. (Today we would add empirical legal studies)” (Sarat, Anderson, Frank, 2010: 13). The editors of the first issue of the Journal tied the law very firmly into a reciprocal relation between the law, society and culture: “The study of law must be informed by an examination of the socio-cultural narratives that shape legal meaning and empower legal norms; conversely, the study of culture requires an understanding of the law as a normative edifice and coercive system” (quoted by Sarat, Matthew and Frank, 2010: 9).</p>
<p class="noindent1">In this double perspective, the law is like the humanities in its concern with the articulating of norms in cultural settings, but it is distinguished from the humanities by the power invested in it by the state to enforce the norms its language objectifies, including on the state itself, through the justice system (Sherwin, 2010: 268). This capacity aligns it with the dominant discourse of the state, the technoscientific knowledge system and its technologies for producing reality as such. But its likeness to the humanities is further emphasised by the nature of its relation to the worlds of human thought and action, both textually and, more specifically, through media narrative. Here the analysis of these legal scholars directly connects with my distinction between modern humanities, for which history and philosophy are the exemplary disciplines, and postmodern humanities, in which media studies (and the theory and fictionality of media texts) has become in principle if not in effect the exemplary instance of the humanities. The basis for this misrecognition is precisely observed by Winter (2010: 102) when he contrasts the always already and now intensively mediated relation between humanity and reality with what could be described as a Western cultural obsession with asserting the transparency of the media screen: “After the linguistic, hermeneutic, and cultural turns of the twentieth century, the idea of an unmediated reality to which we have direct and accurate access should seem like the kind of primitive belief that the West once reflexively imputed to ‘less civilized’ societies. Yet everywhere one turns, this kind of fundamentalism seems to characterize the times in which we live.” It goes to the heart of the politics of knowledge (by which the humanities are disempowered in relation to the state) as well as to the function of law, as Douzinas connects them: “Humanity is now described in scientific terms, whereas the normative realm has been entrusted almost exclusively to law in the form of regulation. Law is no longer the form or the instrument, the tool or restraint of power; it has started turning into the very operation, the substance of power (2010: 70). All advanced knowledge work now faces this co-option by the (corporate) state; but the law is uniquely integral to the articulation and projection of the power of the state in a democratic society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In other words, in this unavoidable relation to the state both the institution of the law and the institution of the university are caught up in a dynamic relation to power which is marked by the scope of judicial freedom to decide a question, on the one hand, and academic freedom to decide a question, on the other, and by the social standing of each institution. The critical test is the extent to which the exercise of freedom to decide conserves the status quo or permits more of the “to-come”, the potential of the future, to be realised and made available to conscious thought. For the latter to be the case, the state also must be oriented in its operation to the “to-come”, not in the temporally and socially limited sense of market futures but in the more fundamental sense of democracy and humanity “to-come”. As Douzinas puts the contrast, “Humanity has no foundation and no ends. Its metaphysical function lies […] in the incessant surprising of the human condition and its exposure to an undecided open future. Humanity exists as an endless process of redefinition and the necessary but impossible attempt to escape external determination. This speculative humanity can, however, only come forth in conflict with a subjugating legal Humanism and a civilizing Humanities that divide and discipline” (2010: 71). This contrast is otherwise captured in Derrida’s distinction between calculation in legal decision-making, which repeats established formulae, and just decision-making, which is open to the difference in each situation requiring decision: “Each case is other, each decision is different and requires an absolutely unique interpretation, which no existing, coded rule can or ought to guarantee absolutely” (1992: 23). The editors of <i>Law and the Humanities</i> enlarge upon this distinction in a way which is directly applicable to the humanities as well when they write that, “When confronted with [law’s fragmentariness, inconsistencies, incommensurabilities, and attendant uncertainties] and with all the moral pressures of adjudication, the temptation is great to shirk the burden of judgment and displace the locus of responsibility onto the language of law itself, to empty law of its meaning and conceive of legal judgment as the impersonal, methodological enactment of a linguistic form, a mere procedure” (5). An excellent example of not shirking the burden of judgment is the 1992 Mabo case concerning indigenous land rights in Australia, where the High Court’s decision removed the historical foundation of colonisation in the <i>terra nullius</i> principle justifying the appropriation of Aboriginal land and marked “the beginning of the sharing of justice and citizenship.”<sup><a id="note39" href="#note_39">39</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">There are three specific issues in the relation between law and a new humanities which I want to take up.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s4.19"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-19">7.1. Singularity</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The first is the recognition of singularity rather than repetition in legal decision-making, on which justice is founded. Douzinas writes that justice should operate “in relation to the other as a singular, unique, finite being with concrete personality traits, character attributes, and physical characteristics. This finite person puts me in touch with infinite otherness. Both inside and outside, justice is the horizon against which the law is judged for its routine successes and failings and for its broader neglect and forgetting of oppression and domination.” Put most succinctly, the axiom of justice is “respect the singularity of the other” (Douzinas, 2010: 61)<sup><a id="note40" href="#note_40">40</a></sup>, which also states the ethic informing both textual analysis and critique in the humanities and the diverse conversations through which the outcomes of textual work are disseminated and critiqued. Even though this work is conducted within the frameworks of tradition, disciplinary formations, and political and cultural collectivities, James Boyd White affirms of legal thought and argument what I would also affirm of knowledge work in the humanities and any use of humanistic knowledge, “that there is – or should be –always an individual mind behind whatever is said and responsible for it” (2006: 44). The insistence throughout <i>Law and the Humanities</i> that the law is not an internally consistent body of true knowledge, progressively augmented, but a fractured body constantly being repaired and taken apart again, because its texts exist in relation to an always changing set of historical, political and cultural circumstances, applies equally to the humanities – and is constitutive of work in the new or postmodern humanties. All of the relations which found this conception of the law and the humanities, however some of their contexts of application and practice differ, is brought together in a single, long and eloquent paragraph in White’s <i>Living Speech</i>:</p>
<p class="quote">With respect to the facts, the lawyer is constantly brought to face the world outside the language of the law; the world of physical and emotional experience, inherently inexpressible - the pain of a broken arm, or a broken marriage, or a broken career – and the world defined by other languages, from science to psychology to economics to geography, each of which has its own domain and way of functioning, different from the law’s. The lawyer must find a way to talk about the world of human experience, and the worlds created by multiple human languages, in the places and language of legal speech. This always involves a process of translation that is inherently imperfect; a large part of his or her art is the recognition of that imperfection and the discovery of a way to proceed notwithstanding. In all of this the law and the lawyer are resisting the claims of people, languages, and institutions alike that they have self-sufficient ways of describing the worlds and living within it that will work for all times and purposes – authoritarian systems of thought and life that cannot be questioned. Every case is new, and presents an opportunity to imagine it in new ways; to this end one calls upon other ways of talking, other languages, new perceptions and understandings, and one’s own experience of life. Every case presents an opportunity for the judge or lawyer to call his reader into a fuller life of thought and imagination and feeling, all with the object of achieving justice - not for all time, but for this time, in the knowledge that in the next case it will have to be done again. (2006: 217-218).</p>
<p class="noindent1">In effect, this account of an ethic of professional speaking and social responsibility should apply across the board, in any relationship between expert and citizen. It is clearly of fundamental importance in the work of government officials and teachers, a core ethic for an education state founded on cultural policy. This cannot be the case in a society dedicated to concepts like efficiency and profit.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s4.20"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-20">7.2. Fictionality</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">I have argued in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a> that the traditional binaries used to value kinds of modern knowledge - fact/fiction; truth/lie; objective/subjective; reality/imagination - have been abolished in postmodernity by the irruption of the excluded middle, the materiality of media technologies and the sign systems which together objectify collective knowledge in texts and memory systems and make its heterogeneity both inescapable and socially and culturally productive.</p>
<p class="noindent1">An important section of <i>Law and Humanities</i>, “Imagining the Law”, attends to the relation between the law and media texts, not only through the regulatory and property rights dimensions of media law or for the ways in which the law and legal practice are represented in various narrative genres - film, novel, television – but by arguing for a more profound similarity between them. Heinzelman (2010: 215) argues that “legal discourse is riven with the fictional, understood as a mode of representing the relation between quotidian reality and its legal version because, like the novel, legal discourse relies on narrative and its interpretation as a form of knowledge” and affirms that it is “now generally accepted that the law is not simply a technique or a body of objective knowledge, but is, like the novel, a distinctive way of representing the world. The interpretation of laws, as well as legal practices and the role of law in constructing a just society, are open to debate and, like literature, are subject to those laws (ethical and aesthetic) that govern imagined realities” (240)”. The phrase “imagined realities” is a significant repositioning of the connotations of the term fiction, the work of the imagination being to bring physical reality within the scope of human ethical and aesthetic commitments and values by means of representations which conserve its otherness as external to consciousness while constituting the shared content of perception. It is not the perception of reality which is brought into question, but an incompleteness in knowledge. A television series like <i>Castle,<sup><a id="note41" href="#note_41">41</a></sup></i> by pairing a writer of detective fiction with a detective, proposes that there is a seamless relationship between the conventions of realist narrative fiction and any citizen’s conception of everyday real life, the (usually invisible) media work of writing creating a fictional copy of that imagined reality. What it may not propose is that the common factor linking the invented story with ordinary life is the human capacity for fiction, in the internalised cultural conceptions of reality which constitute common sense, from time to time and place to place, and in the ability to plot alternative pasts and futures represented by the imaginable narratives deriving from the mental position created by asking “what if?” and by the imminence of possible futures. Both the writer and the criminal are engaged in plotting, each aiming to give shape to an as yet undetermined future; but in the story the criminal’s actions in shaping that future are not permitted to escape the larger framing of social order by the novel, the television programme episode or the law. Knowledge derived from prior experience and situatedness, and the complex webs of relationships which constitute the social world, together make possible both the singular act which crosses the line between private and public spheres, disrupts law and social order and, when detected, transforms the citizen into a criminal, and the line of enquiry by which the detective (in this series in collaboration with the writer) constructs the singular, true narrative of that act.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Pervasive representation of the law in terms of realist conventions, especially in television, creates expectations about the law and its operation which citizens then bring to bear on situations in which they become legal actors, for example, as jurors. Lee (2010: 273) goes so far as to argue that “television conventions (domestic forum, viewer participation, short form, and repetition) have paved the way for juries/viewers to expect the same combination of drama and resolution in actual legal proceedings”, so that such proceedings then function “as a reasonable model for the televisual conventions – conventions that, although fictitious, do respond to an actual wish of viewer/citizens to live within a sound social frame” (274). This is in one respect an instance of “the map preceding the territory”, so that the framing or design of social reality (the conventions according to which social reality is for the time collectively constituted) is not simply determined by a given actuality. Instead, at the core of the relation between social reality and fiction (another excluded middle) is the citizen’s “wish”, the individual and/or collective motivation to realise a preferred, imagined but possible form of living which is now shaped and directed by society’s media systems throughout the human life span as the role of the family or education has diminished.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If a television series like <i>The Good Wife</i> (2009-2016) represents “law’s fragmentariness, inconsistencies, incommensurabilities, and attendant uncertainties” (Sarat, Matthews and Frank, 2010: 5) by interacting the settings of courtroom, law firm, government, the military, business, media, and domestic life and embedding them all in politics, the currently more typical trajectory of television representations of criminal acts and their resolution does not terminate in the dialogic setting of the courtroom; the conclusive identification of the perpetrator is accomplished by the detective or the secret agent using scientific and other real world knowledge. The case is solved (and justice done, and the episode ended) when the criminal or terrorist is correctly identified by the detective and the facts of the case are explained in the form of the (only) true narrative of what happened. As Capretini (1983: 147) puts it, “Crime brings disorder. The traces of a crime bring confusion into the transparent (until then, anyway) sphere of reality.” All of technoscience, but now especially networked ICTs (as an active and visible agent), can be marshalled in the pursuit of the criminal; forensic science and digital technologies provide the primary information required to construct the true narrative, which also serves to restore coherence and transparency to social reality. The structure and meaning of the original Sherlock Holmes stories, which promoted an ideology of scientific rationality as an infallible means for discovering the truth in human affairs as long as the observing, analysing and synthesising “instrument” of the detective’s mind was not distorted in any way, is thus intensified by the development of forensic science and digital technologies as encyclopedic prostheses<sup><a id="note42" href="#note_42">42</a></sup> which, correspondingly, reduce dependence on the singular instrument of the detective’s own mind and provide authoritative knowledge. But this distribution of capacity to technoscience does not obviate the more critical aspect of singularity; however repetitive the narrative arc of each story/episode, the skill of the detective lies in making the right selection from his or her unique knowledge resources and applying them perceptively and interpretively to explaining a unique happening (this crime), which is also to constitute as an event in reality a web of relations linking times, places and persons in a true narrative.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is important to highlight this aspect of the process of solving a crime because it identifies a structure relating knowledge and experience in the social reality of the crime story which is repeated in the difference between the methods of the sciences and the humanities. However powerful the “CSI effect” <sup><a id="note43" href="#note_43">43</a></sup>, the process of reasoning is neither inductive nor deductive; as Harrowitz (2010: 182) wrote in arguing that Holmes’ mode of reasoning can be more properly described as abductive, “Abduction is the step between a fact and its origin; the instinctive, perceptual jump which allows a subject to guess an origin which can then be tested out to prove or disprove the hypothesis.” Capretini provides a further interpretation of the term when he writes that abduction is “based on a single fact, which sometimes presents itself as an enigma, something unexplainable: at this point the observer postulates a hypothesis, that is, he puts an idea into reality by asking himself if it can be demonstrated. […] Pierce insisted on induction’s lack of originality, opposing to it the creative character of the hypotheses generated by abduction. This recalls the Holmesian motif of <i>imagination</i> […]” (2010: 142). Brier (2008: 114) has argued that abduction is “the ability to produce meaningful interpretations from a variety of experiences based on a mixture of perceptions and memories.” All of these characteristics of a mode of reasoning productive of new knowledge in and of culture and social reality are equally descriptive of knowledge work in the humanities. All that one needs to do is substitute “text” for “fact” in Horowitz’s and Capretini’s accounts, and to emphasis the generative quality of this mode of thinking, which is neatly summarised by Capretini’s phrase, “he puts an idea into reality by asking himself if it can be demonstrated.” This is the originary move in the creation of narrative fiction in its modality of imagined reality, as it is in the production of meaning by interpretation. In more speculative fiction and poetry, the only requirement is that it can be written. For a new humanities, reality includes the semiosphere, its heterogeneous mixing of times, places, ideas and forms, and its complex interweaving with and of cultural, social and material reality. By contrast, Holmes, like a modern scientist, sees through texts rather than with them.</p>
<p class="noindent">Heinzelman’s linking of the novel and the law through their creating imagined realities is brilliantly confirmed by the representation of the complex and ambiguous functioning of the law in contemporary American society in William Gaddis’s novel <i>A Frolic of His Own</i> (1994), in which social reality is anything but transparent and the law provides the principal form of resistance to its centrifugal or heterogeneous characteristics. But the law does not stand outside or above, like a statue of Justice or an institution like the Supreme Court; instead, it is woven through social relations and individual subjectivities as knowledge, discourse and practice, available as a weapon or a dialogic means of negotiation and mediation, its concepts and rules however understood playing an active role in every dimension of human relations, but especially the financial and the constitutional. Gaddis reveals the complexity of this discursive weaving at every moment of the novel, which immerses its reader in the flows of conversation between characters generated by the self-consciousness, knowledge and experience of, and negotiations between, singular minds singularly positioned in a shared social reality. One example is part of a conversation between a lawyer, Harry, and his wife, Christina:</p>
<p class="quote1">[…] Teen, how could we know it would all turn into such a…</p>
<p class="quote1">— Harry, could you…</p>
<p class="quote1">— No.</p>
<p class="quote1">— But you haven’t even…</p>
<p class="quote1">— I said no Christina. Don’t get me into it. Better watch out yourself too when she said she may need you.</p>
<p class="quote1">— She just means my moral sup…</p>
<p class="quote1">— If she’s going to court she needs a witness. You were with her?</p>
<p class="quote1">— At the clinic? I had to go with her Harry. I mean you never know what’s going to happen at a place like that and of course it did, this nicely dressed young man in rimless glasses suddenly stepping up and throwing catsup on her fur coat, something about spilling innocent blood God knows what he was, animal rights or rights to life, it was quite unnerving.</p>
<p class="quote1">— Probably both, and the gun lobby thrown in. You mean she had the abortion.</p>
<p class="quote1">— That’s why she’s terrified of going to prison, you heard her. This frightful boy demanding his paternal rights as though she were some kind of brood cow, she’d literally found him on the street picking up cigarette butts and pulling newspapers out of trashcans so she invited him to dinner and the police called just as they were siting down. He’d stolen a book from a bookstore to bring her as a gift, some science fiction nonsense about people living under water, he kept telling them it was his book, he meant he’d written it there was his name on the cover but the price of books is so appalling these days he obviously couldn’t afford it but of course they couldn’t see it that way till she went down there herself and ordered fifty copies to calm them down. Now he’s ready to send her to prison for murdering his child. His child!</p>
<p class="quote1">— Nobody’s going to send her to prison, certainly make the world safer for democracy if they did but she’ll probably just be cited for contempt and fined, a good healthy one if she shows up in those diamonds. What was she doing at a public clinic?</p>
<p class="quote1">— She could hardly go to her own hospital, I mean not while she’s suing them could she?</p>
<p class="quote1">— You mean she’s got one set of lawyers bringing this suit for foetal endangerment and another set to defend her abortion. No wonder they talk to each other.</p>
<p class="quote1">— I suppose that’s exactly why she has two sets. I mean this way she probably counts on winning one or the other after the lesson she learned losing that dreadful custody battle over T. J. she’s still livid about it.</p>
<p class="quote1">— But she won didn’t she? Doesn’t the boy live with her?</p>
<p class="quote1">— That was the problem Harry, Neither of them wanted him. Of course the father paid through the nose for support and a trust fund, one of those quart a day louts in ostrich skin boots who owned most of downtown Lubbock till somebody shot him and she had to take his estate to court against six other paternity suits for a settlement. I mean that’s hardly the case this time. God knows what this miserable boy thought he was up to, he’s really not quite bright if you take a look at his book.</p>
<p class="quote1">— Maybe just bright enough to figure if he got her pregnant she’d marry him, the inevitable divorce comes along and he ends up with the child and collects a bundle for its support. Like T. J. in reverse.</p>
<p class="quote1">— Well you see you could help if you wanted to Harry, think about it, I mean of course he was planning something like that, he… (238-240)</p>
<p class="noindent1">What is wonderful about the writing of this novel is its constant representation of what to “think about it” signifies about being human, and how that mental action and its elaboration in conversation constantly links the most diverse domains of knowledge, imagination and experience in local transactions mixing understanding and social action, in which the law is an ever-present component. The novel as an imagined reality opens a cognitive space for exploration and enquiry into possible versions of reality, into what might have been or could be, as a critical part of the collective process of both achieving consensus about what is real and envisaging futures which provide templates for social action. As Heinzelman notes, fiction in this sense is an integral component of legal thinking, in the interpretation of texts and construing the meaning of human actions.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s4.21"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-21">7.3. Democracy to-come</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The ground of innovation and creativity in law, as in the humanities, lies in the just interpretation of the singular text/event and its liberation of future possibilities for thought. The impulse to conserve, strong in both the law and the humanities and of great importance in ensuring that a society or nation maintains continuity over time with its cultural origins, can nonetheless serve to bind the thought of the present to its pasts rather than provide openings to its possible futures. We live under the hegemony of a progressivist ideology focussed on science and technology as the knowledges which matter, and yet we in democratic societies seem to have given up any progressivist belief in the further evolution of democracy or the amelioration of unequal social and economic inheritances. Central to any conception of democracy to come is the role of the law as both the guardian of the interpretation of a nation’s constitution and the most direct medium through which its interpretation can be challenged, revised and renewed. In this way the law is both constitutive of the state and the means of its deconstruction. It is through the latter capability that the law can open a society to its possible futures, and specifically to the forms of democracy to come which it can realise in the practice of collective decision-making and the ongoing reform of the core institutions established for this purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A previous Prime Minster of New Zealand, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, offers a particularly relevant discussion of law reform in a chapter in his autobiography, <i>Reform: A Memoir</i>. His argument also links to my larger case for an education state. Palmer notes that “Government is an endlessly iterative process” (2013: 601) while also observing the tendency for law reform reports to be neglected if they do not align with a government’s political priorities. Put another way, this is to recognise that Parliament, as lawmaker, should produce texts which aim to clarify existing thought and practice or to modify it on the basis of the best knowledge through the power located in the structures of government. What is most significant about Palmer’s account of the law reform process is that it blends expert knowledge and public experience with the end of ensuring that government decision-making is based on a legal framework which is in touch with and responsive to public knowledge of the world as it is, and the complex ways in which that knowledge is interpreted by history and values. A political (party) perspective is only one among many informed perspectives on the state of society at any moment, and it is critical that the legal framework within which free citizens act and decide about the future development of their society is as relevant to their circumstances as possible. As Palmer shows, a public body mandated to test the adequacy of existing law and to explore recommendations for change outside the party political system by drawing on international and local research and extensive local public consultation can provide an important public service by creating openings to the future for public thought and increasing public awareness of the importance of the law-making work of Parliament. As he wrote, “the need for updating the law and keeping it in good repair is as great as ever” and, for this function to be performed effectively, Palmer affirms what I want to affirm for a new humanities: “Lawyers, legal educators and judges need to increase the range of their skills if they are to be successful law reformers” because, at the core of the process lies understanding of “the expectations and values of the community” (619); in other words, to make expert, formal knowledge relevant to informed practice in society as a whole is critical for the effective participation of expert knowledge in public conversation about the future of society and requires of the expert the same rhetorical skill that I have argued is required of the representatives of the academic humanities in their engagement with and promulgation of humanistic knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Palmer’s view that Aotearoa New Zealand is most unusual among nation-states in not having a written Constitution adds a further important dimension to this conception of the text-based character of the law and its role in society. There is no objective or absolute basis on which a society or a state can be founded; the idea of a state and a nation exists and is sustained in the minds and experiences of its members, and the texts which record from time to time how those members represent their thought about themselves to themselves and the world. The moment of foundation is typically retrospectively validated, as Derrida has demonstrated and has been exemplified in Aotearoa New Zealand in the recovery of the Treaty of Waitangi more than a century after its signing.<sup><a id="note44" href="#note_44">44</a></sup> Texts, especially the regulatory texts of the law, objectify this thought without being able to make it permanent or their meanings invariant. This is a critical strength of text-based societies when the interpretation and revision of the texts which record the foundational principles, beliefs, histories and regulations framing common sense and giving order to social life is an on-going, socially inclusive process by which their meanings are adapted with deliberation to changing circumstances, knowledge and values; equally, however, that strength is dissipated when their interpretation is controlled by authoritarian institutions.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Douzinas observes that “life under the rule of law is more than an implied social contract; it is a structure of feeling, a way of being in the world, which reflects a rich, complex, and deeply embedded set of traditions and cultural practices” (2010: 71). This excellent summary of the underlying implications of this discussion of the law as an instance of the humanities at work in the world emphasises, as does Gaddis in his novel, that the law in democratic societies is not just a technical mystery into which a few are inducted, but is distributed throughout society as a form of common knowledge, a heritage, a part of democratic culture, an intrinsic element in the constitution of the selfhood of the democratic subject. Miller and Yudice (2002: 190) affirm that the “task of binding people to a polity” is constant; it is also, of course, never to be completed, not least because new generations have to learn why being bound matters and how each citizen can think and act freely in ways which contribute to the on-going reinvention of that polity by its members as a collective and negotiated project. The task, as I am arguing throughout, is educative in character and, as a first principle, must be sensitive to the singularity of minds, cultural histories, beliefs and long-term social goals. The more the “task of binding” is left to the policing and other coercive and surveillance arms of the state, the less that state can claim to be a democracy and the greater its failure over generations to govern justly on behalf of all of its people. Unlike the rest of the humanities, the law is directly involved in the governing of society; but to understand that the primary purpose of that involvement is the maintenance and extension of justice and the freedom of the citizen, and the responsible administration of political, economic, and cultural relations among citizens and the institutions of civil society is also to acknowledge that the law itself is framed by the question, what does it mean to be human?, and by the opening to possible futures which multiple possible answers to that question make available.</p>
<p class="noindent1">By placing the work of government, law, and the humanities in a democracy under the sign of justice, the complex dynamic between the singular citizen, the cultural knowledge and forms of social order developed over time and in a specific place, and the means by which that knowledge and those forms of order are adapted to changing circumstance and by the pressure of thought is made more explicit. As Derrida has demonstrated, a just decision crosses a threshold between the known and the unknown and so extends the scope of the knowable by its focus on the singular instance:</p>
<p class="quote">for a decision to be just and responsible, it must, in its proper moment if there is one, he both regulated and without regulation: it must conserve the law and also destroy it or suspend it enough to have to reinvent.it in each case, rejustify it, at least reinvent it in the reaffirmation and the new and free confirmation of its principle. Each case is other, each decision is different and requires an absolutely unique interpretation, which no existing, coded rule can or ought to guarantee absolutely. At least, if the rule guarantees it in no uncertain terms, so that the judge is a calculating machine, which happens, and we will not say that he is just, free and responsible (1992: 23).</p>
<p class="noindent1">We might also substitute “artist” or “humanist” for “judge”; their work of decision, whether judgment, artistic creation or textual interpretation, is to be evaluated according to the same criteria and the expectation that the agent of this work is “just, free and responsible” in its performance. And, as each of these practitioners is also a singular citizen, it is critical to democratic decision-making that the state should sustain the conditions necessary for “just, free and responsible” thought and action. The orientation of the education state towards the practice of justice in all of its institutions depends upon this humanistic conception of the role of the law and opens the way to democracy to-come.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s4.22"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-22">8. Sites of Conversation</a></h3>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s4.23"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-23">8.1 The Media System of an Education State</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Just as the role of the public sector in New Zealand has been profoundly distorted and its importance to social and economic development deeply compromised by the reforms of the past thirty years, so has the role of the media. Media systems are fundamental social technologies, and the existence of “the public” is largely a function of the ability to access and use the communication channels available to citizens. Just as it is insufficient to evaluate public sector agencies on the basis of their contribution to economic activity, so it is necessary to ask in what ways the current media system of a democratic nation creates public value by facilitating and informing public conversation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The capacity of New Zealanders historically to use world knowledge creatively was a function of the value placed on public education and the public library, two nationally dsitributed institutions constituting a media system. These were key elements in a democratic infrastructure providing open access to information to a diverse public, not just an expert caste, which did not attempt to predict or direct its uses.<sup><a id="note45" href="#note_45">45</a></sup> In its utopian version, the internet was to be omnicompetent in respect of these functions in the new information order. But, like other broadcast media before it – print, radio, television - the internet is a site of a power struggle between public and private interests, in which the public depend on active engagement on its behalf by the state in order to even up the odds. The lack of support by the previous National government for the public charter for broadcasting (and for TVNZ7 in particular) clearly demonstrated, in New Zealand and at least in this matter, that the state is not fulfilling this role.<sup><a id="note46" href="#note_46">46</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">An evolving knowledge society and creative/innovative uses of knowledge by its people depend on the widest possible access to the widest range of sources. This turns back to Derridaʻs observation about control of the archive, because limiting the extent of control over knowledge and its circulation exercised by specific interests (corporate, state, religious, professional, etc) goes to the heart of a societyʻs capacity to reinvent itself democratically, especially as now in times of rapid change. Miltonʻs <i>Areopagitica</i> explored these issues at the time of the origin of the English triennial parliamentary system and its complex relationship to the printing press as a technology enabling a kind of public broadcasting in competition with the pulpit. The concept of public value applied to postmodern media systems whether under public or private ownership points towards a similar analysis, based on increasing public understanding of the world at large as a critical context for understanding and discussing collectively the issues and decisions facing the citizens of a particular society. If Aljazeera offers an excellent example of how a global television system can create this kind of public value, the national conversation about New Zealand in the world is carried on most diversely by public radio. At the heart of public value in the evaluation of media systems is the ability of citizens to acquire new knowledge presented openly (including openness about the values shaping that knowldge), and to learn and share learning with others; the role of the education state in media policy and provision is to ensure that citizens are capable of using contemporary media to these ends and understand why their participation in the government of their society matters. An education state would also ensure that the criterion of public value is applied to all media organisations broadcasting within national boundaries as an alternative to audience ratings as a measure of value.<sup><a id="note47" href="#note_47">47</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">It is a theme through this book that a major outcome of the genesis and evolution of postmodernity is the invention of networked digital information and communications technologies; an outcome, not the determinant, in this period of epistemic change. No aspect of society or subjectivity has been left untouched by this development in cognitive technology and the devices which provide the digital entry point to virtuality (the novel, of course, is such a device, but employing a different distribution of functions between technological and human capabilities). In relation to government and the operation of the public sector, digital ICTs have brought with them new powers and responsibilities, and profound organisational change. In his study <i>The Civic Long Tail</i>, Charles Leadbeater considers these issues from the citizen end of the spectrum, and argues that the increasing diversity of networked communication tools is generating new expectations among citizens about their role in shaping decision-making. But what is the right relationship between citizens using social media to advance their interests and the tendency of expert systems, holding and accumulating data, to become impersonal and alienating? He argues that what is needed are “systems that scale but which are also intelligent enough to attend to the local, the human and the personal” (2011: 25-26). As with everything else to do with technology, it is not the technology as such but the designers and the designs they have incorporated in it which matter most. As he observes,</p>
<p class="quote">Better systems to mine and analyse data, to make automated decisions about allocating resources, could, at the extreme, license ‘government by algorithm’. Government departments, service delivery chains and entire cities could be run by pervasive, invisible systems of which we have little knowledge. That is not at all the same as revitalising democracy by using the web to make it more collaborative and conversational. The challenge is to find a way to combine these two very different visions of the civic future: more effective and intelligent public systems, based in part on the analysis of ‘big data’ combined with more adaptive and capable communities, able to use the data to solve problems they face (18).<sup><a id="note48" href="#note_48">48</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Public sector agencies at all levels of society are critical for providing fora, public access to media systems and information to ensure that this public conversation is resourced, that they are recognised as participants and not controllers,<sup><a id="note49" href="#note_49">49</a></sup> and that its outcomes can be connected in to the various layers of government. As I will discuss below, the city is a particularly important setting for this public work, because the greatest concentrations and diversity of knowledge and interests, and the most advanced forms of media systems, are located in urban spaces.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Consequently, to approach the question of innovation through culture, and to approach the question of technology through the example of media technologies, is to demonstrate how far apart are the different framings of innovation and knowledge policy when the starting point is either technology or culture. For the former, culture is typically placed in the background as the local context in which knowledge work determined by international measures of value is done and new technologies are installed; for the latter, technologies wherever invented are understood and adopted (if they are, and even if they are imposed) through their acculturation and adaptation in local contexts of use. To regard media technologies as the exemplary instance of technology as such is to bring into the foreground the deep interactivity of technology and culture, to shift the centre of knowledge policy away from the universals of technoscience and towards the ongoing (re)production of society and its economies through cultural innovation. In this respect, the capacities of digital networked media of communication for intensifying conversation through the cultural processes of dissemination and reinvention are what matter most.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s4.24"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-24">8.2 The Parliament of an Education State</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The Parliament of an education state is its representative institution, distilling a society’s conversations (including those initiated and participated in by public sector agencies) into just policies and laws through open, deliberative debate and public consultation, and leading democratic social innovation (but, as it were from behind). Parliament’s role as the model for and guardian of the open conversation of a democratic society exceeds in importance its function as lawmaker or economic developer; in the former role lies most of the possibility for constructively managed adaptation and change through public learning and participation. Parliament from this perspective can be thought of as the collective author of an on-going social fiction or imagined reality, through its decisions, acts and laws (all discursive) creating new social worlds and giving form to possible futures through acts of comprehending and knowing. When Milton challenged his Parliament’s decision to impose censorship on the press, he affirmed that its greatness as a democratic institution would be most apparent “when your prudent spirit acknowledges and obeyes the voice of reason from what quarter soever it be heard speaking.”<sup><a id="note50" href="#note_50">50</a></sup> That the “voice of reason” is multiple only magnifies the complex role of Parliament as a democratic nation’s officially representative voice, and its work as productive of the new meanings needed to make new thinking and social action collectively possible in a nation’s cultural space. For Latour, in his fundamental challenge to Western conventions of thought, democracy only begins to be realised when both human and nonhuman collectivities are able to speak.</p>
<p class="noindent1">With Parliament, the public sector, universities, the private sector, and civil society, a democratic society has available to it a diversity of institutional means and perspectives to assess what can be known and its relevance to its cultural evolution, and to formulate policy options and the terms of decision-making at a national level. The crucial function of Parliament is to make choices on behalf of the public. Because no knowledge claim by itself can be simply authoritative, but must also pass through the test of values and beliefs, it is necessary that, in a democracy, the composition of Parliament should reflect the major groupings of political thought and conviction, and that Parliament’s decisions should be recorded and empowered as laws. For the work of Parliament, carried out at the summit of the public conversation in a nation state, must be based on the best assessments of the state of the nation if its governance is to be open to its possible futures rather than closed by recycling ideas and beliefs which are past their use-by date.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There can never be a policy in a democracy which can articulate without qualification a unitary national conception, however much a technocratic mindset would prefer that to be the case. Politics is a humanistic and not a scientific enterprise, a fact often noted with regret or despair by scientists and misrecognised by politicians who claim to formulate their policies from evidenced-based knowledge. The very point of politics (at least where political discourse and behaviour is not dominated by the sound bite, focus groups and the crafting of media images) is to articulate value-laden positions on issues of fact, meaning and possibility, in effect providing one of the socially active domains where cultural knowledge (and therefore the humanities) is being put into practice. As Debray succinctly opposed them, “culture is what splits apart the human species while technology unites them” (2000: 56). All policy is the negotiated outcome of divergent ways of thinking expressed and modified in conversation; my point is that there should be no privileged conversations in this social process, no inside track stifling other perspectives which may be more in touch with the possible futures of a society, no prior determination that some kinds of knowledge are of more inherent value than other kinds. The current contest between so-called left and right parties through polling and focus groups for the 15% or so of swinging voters at election time is democratically self-defeating and cynical; it abrogates the ability of political leadership and party formation as one means (civil society organisations are another) of clarifying the implications for social action of different ways of thinking and prevents a broader discussion engaging the many different dimensions of belief and value which it should be the task of Parliament to reconcile as much as possible. Momentary crystallisations of a national conversation into policy and law is here understood to be the outcome of a mutually educative process in which local conversations are heard across the nation, modifying each other even while never simply becoming repetitions. And the form of words taken by the policy or the law, as it circulates through the public sphere through education, public relations, news media and acts of regulation, becomes generative of further conversation, including challenges in a court of law and academic critique. The law or policy thus formulated is always provisional; it represents a collective decision for the time, always to be revised in an on-going enquiry into the difference it has made in the life of the singular citizen as well as the collective life of the nation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Consent by the people to the rule of law and to taxation, on which the conduct of democratic societies depends, is fragile. A government in a democratic society is an interface between its citizens and the complex global order of state and non-state organisations, public, private, civil society, militant, and criminal. If a small nation state like Aotearoa New Zealand is required to position itself as a dependency of the current imperial power, it must surrender its unique culture, formed from the cultures and languages of the peoples who reside in its territory, to the dominant imperial culture. This is not just a matter of the globalisation of trade and specifically of the entertainment industry and the IP in cultural goods; it goes to the core of the foundations and historical evolution of political and social thought in a specific geopolitical space. It is apparent, for example, that the similar British foundations of democratic governance in the United States and New Zealand have been elaborated in culturally very different directions over the past two centuries. But now these cultural differences are being often silently erased through instruments like trade negotiations which entrench the conceptions of the social bond and the obligation of government to citizens familiar to the dominant power. This is merely the universalising of imperial cultures, not post-imperial globalisation as symbolised by the free flows of heterogeneous knowledge and values across borders. Imperial powers have always imposed themselves on subject populations through non-military as well as military means. If finance and law are obvious examples, another is the use of imperial literature and arts in and out of formal education as a form of soft power<sup><a id="note51" href="#note_51">51</a></sup>, culture in this modality having been demonstrated by postcolonial analysts to be a significant means of binding British colonies to the British Empire.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A programme which is discovered in a nation’s conversations, which grows out of local knowledge and is given national form by negotiation among all the individuals and groups with an interest in it, will always be politically shaped because social, institutional, financial and ideological power are also dimensions of any conversation. But the critical difference in a democratic conversation is that those dimensions should be mitigated rather than magnified by the conduct of Parliament. Parliament’s creative role is discovery, not imposition; like the principles informing slow food, attention to the quality of the ingredients, the cultural soil they grew in, and their thoughtful combination produces laws and policy with deep roots in the lived world of the nation and its heritage. By reflecting the nation’s conversations back to the nation in forms which draw them into acceptable because openly discussed and debated solutions to perceived national problems and issues, Parliament performs its cultural work in a way which enhances the quality of democratic life.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The political party is a good example of the interaction of the singular mind with a collectivity founded in a shared history and body of knowledge, and beliefs and theories about what it means to be human (hence political cultures), in which factual evidence is necessary in political representations of the world but is never sufficient because that evidence remains to be interpreted by ways of thinking into social reality. Political parties need to convince the public that their interpretation of the best knowledge available is the right one in the circumstances, but this process of public evaluation depends upon public access to fully informed and accessible sources, including explicit judgments about the inadequacies and limitations of current knowledge. In other words, political thought and action occurs in the semiotic space in which humanity negotiates its relation to the given world and to the multitude of cultures, histories, societies, nations and their possible futures which have materialised and continue to materialise in the given world as expressions of what it means to be human. As I have argued, semiotic space is also the space of the humanities. Brier writes that the foundations of science lie in “the human perceptive and cognitive ability to gain knowledge and communicate this in dialogue with others in a common language” (2008: 83); it is the capacity and need for “dialogue with others in a common language” which founds all knowledge formation. Politics precedes science as a mode of knowledge-based decision-making, and science cannot supplant it. Dialogue is formed and modelled in culture and exemplified in political discourse as one among many situated and institutionalised (and often ritualised) instances of dialogic exchange. What needs to be emphasised is that, to be meaningful and productive, “dialogue with others” cannot be either a closed system or one in which one voice in an exchange dominates and can silence the others, especially by employing the power of a social or official position.<sup><a id="note52" href="#note_52">52</a></sup> Much of current political discourse fails to meet this criterion, one reason why democratic politics have reached a very low level of estimation in most democracies, and even more in the estimation of citizens of societies in which democratic institutions are unavailable or sit uneasily on top much more ancient methods of governance. To achieve decision-making on behalf of a group or a nation, a social process which should be sensitive to the singular mind and its experience of the world, given and human, and to the differences revealed in dialogue between contemporary minds and between those minds and the accumulated resources of knowledge available to them, is both the burden and the dream of democratic insitutions and democratic politics. The more this dialogic process is compromised and negated in the name of urgency or expediency, the more temporary and unstable are the foundations on which citizen consent to government is granted and maintained, and the greater the tendency for states to use police and military powers for control of their own populations.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Throughout the world, the concept of democracy is being hollowed out by business-driven states in Western societies and by their support of non-democratic regimes, and by the abuse of electoral procedures, judicial systems and constitutional frameworks which should (but do not) guarantee full citizen participation in the conduct of society. Whether because of passing legislation under urgency, manipulating electoral procedures to block expression of the (heterogeneous) will of the people, gaining favourable legislation by the use of wealth, or any of the other methods conventionally employed to corrupt the principles upon which democratic government is supposedly founded, the case for democracy has become profoundly compromised by the very people who claim to represent it in government.<sup><a id="note53" href="#note_53">53</a></sup> Parliaments have followed the ideological permissions of the past three decades and their elected members have become an interest group using the means available to them to protect and advance personal and party interests over those of the general public. It has become less a means of resolving differences through public and collective discussion and decision-making (however that has usually been more of an ideal than a fact of its operation) than of allocating public resources to those with the most social power, not least now because of the constraints imposed on its open and free operation by privately owned media and their power to shape public perception.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A more productive way of thinking about the relation between Parliament and citizens is by shifting attention from those who hold most social and economic power to those who constitute the “civic long tail” (Leadbetter, 2011), citizens distributed through the myriad networks and groupings of interests which make up a complex society. It is here that the full diversity of culturally inflected knowledge comes into play, the creativity of singular minds is manifested in communication with one another, and the practice of innovation is explored. Whether the social site is the backyard shed where innovations in personal computing were imagined and embodied in machinic forms, the kitchen or the coffee bar, the gym or the hospital ward, the board room or the office, the nursery or the classroom, new thinking is a function of the openness of conversation and the cultural inventory participants bring to it. In one respect, Parliament is just another social site able to advance innovative thought through conversation and decision if its processes and its participants conceive of their role in this way, but with the peculiar function of being tasked to hear the infinite number of local conversations which give initial definition to informed reflections on experience and to condense them into programmes, plans and laws which capture for the nation the implications of citizens’ awareness of movement and change where they are geographically, socially and culturally situated. The current common process, which is to download programmes, plans and laws into the nation from other societies because they have “worked” elsewhere and which gives the impression of achieving something, ignores all of the cultural embeddedness which was crucial to their effect at their point of origin and the cultural differences which inhibit, compromise, distort or (sometimes) enhance their proposed effects when relocated. As Lotman has argued, translation and not copying is always the procedure when knowledge crosses cultural and linguistic borders at any level of social organisation, and it is an activity in which Parliament engages constantly, whether it recognises it or not. To hear what its publics are saying, Parliament must first listen and not dictate. The main tendencies or divisions in public thought and culture must be represented among those elected to Parliament, difficult if the electoral system prevents it.<sup><a id="note54" href="#note_54">54</a></sup> But the effectiveness of a fully representative Parliament and government depends on the complementary existence of a public well-informed and socially and politically engaged.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The title page of Hobbes’s <i>Leviathan</i> is a powerful representation of all forms of absolutist or totalitarian rule, still the most common at the beginning of the twenty-first century, in which the heterogeneous vitality and power of the city’s people is absorbed by the interests of the leader. The representation is suggestive of another reading pertinent to twenty-first century democracies and the mediation of relations between the state, the private sector and the public by databases and networked and encrypted communications systems; instead of assimilation into the body of the king/state as bodies, citizens are now assimilated as signs of themselves written in official records and the traces of behavioural attributes left in communications and commercial record systems. The city remains full and apparently free while under not the eye of God or the king but the now multiple eyes of the digital panopticon, symbolised for the early twenty-first century by Google Earth and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV/drone). Control is exercised through virtual citizen bodies created by those owning digital systems and the personal data they accumulate, another aspect of the imagined realities<sup><a id="note55" href="#note_55">55</a></sup> by means of which the postmodern state acts on the social and given worlds.</p>

<h4 class="sec2" id="s4.25"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-25">8.3 The City in the Education State</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Writing from London during the civil war, Milton asked his readers to “Behold now this vast City: a City of refuge, the mansion house of liberty” (237). For Milton, the liberated city is the engine of social and intellectual innovation and the first task of government is to protect and enlarge the liberty of the thinking citizen; a democratic state which fails to make this its priority is on the way to becoming, or has become in principle if not yet in fact, “oppressive, arbitrary, and tyrannous” (241)<sup><a id="note56" href="#note_56">56</a></sup>. It is both startling and deeply ironic that the code word of the proponents of the knowledge society – innovation – should be precisely what Milton sees as the consequence of intellectual and political liberty, but for him focussed on the discovery of new knowledge which has direct implications not only for what it means to be human but for the nature and practice of human institutions. He is writing in a time of civil warfare between different interpretations of fundamental conceptions of humanity and human institutions – the early twenty-first century is a time of global warfare on the same grounds – and while he draws an analogy between the social energies released by war and the intellectual energies released in a state governed by a foundational principle of the liberty of the citizen, he emphasises the concentration of intellect and thought in the city: “the pens and heads there, sitting by their studious lamps, musing, searching, revolving new notions and idea’s [sic] […]; others as fast reading, trying all things, assenting to the force of reason and convincement.[…] Where there is much desire to learn, there of necessity will be much arguing, much writing, many opinions; for opinion in good men is but knowledge in the making” (237).<sup><a id="note57" href="#note_57">57</a></sup> And, of course, a critical factor in the ability of the city to function in this way is access to the means available for public communication; without a media system open to the publication of new ideas without censorship, what Milton calls the condition of “free writing and free speaking” (240), their extensive dissemination and the widest public engagement with and benefit from them is impossible.<sup><a id="note58" href="#note_58">58</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">The living social environment in which the quality, competence and foresight of the work and thinking of the democratic state is most fully revealed is the city, understood as the site of the most complex human expressions and interactions (personal, cultural, institutional, political, economic and natural, from the most embodied in the street to the most abstract in statistical representation or between sites of social and financial power), a local instance, shaped by topography, climate, geopolitics, ideas and history, of humanity’s ability to evolve beyond our origins in nature through collective thought. Soja (1996: 81, 311) quotes Lefebvre’s description of the city as a “possibilities machine”; as the site of thirdspace, it is “a lived space of radical openness and unlimited scope, where all histories and geographies, all times and places, are immanently presented and represented, a strategic space of power and domination, empowerment and resistance.” The fundamental components of a city’s vitality are the singular subjects of a social collectivity, possessed of cultural inventories and communicational competence, and their inventiveness in the face of complexity, not least their own. To walk in the city is to move in a galaxy of worlds, each discrete and visible body marked by unique but mostly hidden histories, each a node of invisible networks of energy and meaning, each a chance scripting of life composing consciously and unconsciously the text of its future and that of humanity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The city is an instantiation of the semiosphere, a local totality of the human past, the present and anticipations of the future, a heterogeneous assemblage of texts enduring, being rewritten, forgotten and replaced, like an archive filling the space of its ground plan and creating new space as it extends its borders. It is a complex, collectively created text all of whose component parts are inscribed with meanings, and composed, like sculptures, by impressing will, intention and knowledge on to physical matter. It is the composite scene in which all of the institutions of a postmodern society interact knowledgably with citizens and with each other. In the educational and memory institutions of the city – library, archive, museum, gallery, school, university, and government, in their traditional and digital modalities – are located the greatest concentrations of a society’s cultural records and it is, consequently, the prime site – physical and virtual - of humanistic learning. The city is the fullest collectively evolving expression of what it means to be human, and hence the ultimate focus of the work of textual critique characteristic of the humanities. At any given moment, the cultural fields of any postmodern society are in a chaotic flux of contested values and political formations; discovering patterns in this flux is the work of a new humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The city is a text of texts written in all media and using all the materials available over time to signify, accumulate, revise and condense meaning in forms which are reflective, exploratory and defining of our (in)humanity. It is the organic, pre-modern city of Bacon’s <i>Design of Cities</i>, as an evolved, collective construct without deliberate planning but shaped by its geographical location; or More’s Utopia as the work of art and reason, designed by a singular mind (both king and author); or the new Jerusalem, mystically revealing the divine ordering and end of the universe. In the midst, over time, there are cities which become subject to ideas and geometries, manifested in authored buildings – Wren’s St. Paul’s or Michelangelo’s St Peter’s, with Rome as the model of the imperial city; and then designed townscapes – The Mall in Washington, DC, the Edinburgh New Town, Canberra with a lake at its centre and its Parliament under a hill; and New World frontier towns fitted into the grids of military organisation. And the neoliberal city exemplified by Panama City,<sup><a id="note59" href="#note_59">59</a></sup> to be contrasted with “’generous cities’: human settlements that nestle within the living world” and are regenerative by design (Raworth, 2017: 223). It is the digital environment<sup><a id="note60" href="#note_60">60</a></sup> of cyberspace imagined by William Gibson and the learned City or City of Science invoked by Latour (2004: 36, 67).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The imagined city is materialised over time in built forms and manifests in its layers and zones the changing social and class structures of the society to which it gives material expression. It is also materialised in fiction: The Last Redoubt in William Hope Hodgson’s <i>The Nightland</i> as the defensive exoskeleton for the remnant of humanity drawing upon the last energies of a dying planet and its dying sun, rethought in Greg Bear’s <i>City at the End of Time</i>; the space station Babylon 5 in the TV series of the same name providing the same means of sustaining social and animate life in the vacuum of space but, like any global city, a place of interaction for an astonishing diversity of cultures and species; or the virtual city of the Metaverse in Stephenson’s <i>Snow Crash</i>; or New Corabuzon of Miéville’s <i>Perdito Street Station</i>, to be read together with the alternative London of Gibson and Sterling’s <i>The Difference Engine</i>; or the alternative Manchester of Noon’s <i>Automated Alice</i>: these cities are imagined as chaotic but also knowable and familiar sites of human, non-human and technological species, economic, political, intellectual and cultural diversity in contrast to the absolute philosophical and legal order of More’s Utopia.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The city both incorporates and fails to reconcile according to any rational principle of order the extraordinary diversity of human invention, as self- and collective invention, accumulating in its physical evolution and territorial expansion fragmentary instances of all of its histories and the ideas of humanity enacted in and on it over its lifetime<sup><a id="note61" href="#note_61">61</a></sup>. This is why the city can be regarded as a text, its possible orders and their on-going recomposition a local instance of the semiosphere, its dynamic the materialisation of the energies of thought (of which its economic activity, now taken to be the most important of its characteristics, is but a subset of its energies and dynamism and is dependent on the semiotic for its content and purpose). It is a work combining art and technology, bricolage and found art accumulating through the passage of time, intentional authorship by singular minds and collectivities of minds, space written into built form through the application of knowledge by technological power, wealth, politics and ideas, and written aesthetically whether in ugliness or beauty, reason or unreason, hubris or humility, because (like the Tower of Babel) inevitably expressive of the moral qualities of the builders.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Lotman’s (1990: 191-202) discussion of St Petersburg as a particular instance of what is distinctive about “the city” as a human creation has particular significance here. His general observations are highly relevant to any consideration of the scope of cultural policy, and of integration within the humanities:</p>
<p class="quote">The city is a complex semiotic mechanism, a culture-generator, but it carries out this function only because it is a melting pot of texts and codes, belonging to all kinds of languages and levels. The essential semiotic polyglottism of every city is what makes it so productive of semiotic encounters. The city, being the place where different national, social and stylistic codes and texts confront each other, is the place of hybridization, recodings, semiotic translations, all of which makes it into a powerful generator of new information. These confrontations work diachronically as well as synchronically: architectural ensembles, city rituals and ceremonies, the very plan of the city, the street names and thousands of other left-overs from past ages act as code programmes constantly renewing the texts of the past. The city is a mechanism, forever recreating its past, which can then be synchronically juxtaposed with the present. In this sense, the city, like culture, is a mechanism which withstands time (194-195).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Writing from a new world city with only a fraction of the years European and Middle Eastern cities have endured, it becomes easier for me to see how those living only in awareness of the city’s present and believing that they are located on the cusp of its future can think so little of its accumulated past, when that layer is so thin, where the official model of time is progressive, not recursive, and where land and buildings are understood primarily in terms of their market value. It is also clear why the destruction of cities in revolutionary phases of social change should occur; the city also preserves and materialises the experience and memory of oppression and the entrenchment of class interests in its zones of privilege and authority, that dimension of its existence in which generative “confrontations” facilitating renewal are blocked. Lotman’s description shows how the city multiplies the possibilities of normal individual creativity and innovativeness by contextualising and complexly informing it, giving a precise geography, history and communicational infrastructure (from the street through all of its media systems to the sites of its governance) to the larger collectivities of languages and cultures in which each person is enmeshed.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In respect of St. Petersburg Lotman makes a distinction which applies perfectly to the present disjunction between neoliberal, technocratic policy formation and the complex reality of cities, and helps explain the exclusion of humanistic knowledge and modes of thinking and analysis from official decision-making. He writes that the city “had to be both an economic centre and the place where different cultural languages came together; and semiotic polyglottism is the law for this type of city. At the same time, the ideal of the ‘military capital’ demanded uniformity and strict conformity to a single semiotic system” (201). The neoliberal discourse of government requires a similar reduction and requirement for conformity to a dominant discourse, a command structure made operational through economics and finance, “the city organized by precepts and deprived of history” (201). Ironically, in Lotman’s view, the actual economy is polyglot and nonconforming, like culture.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put another way, the city rather than the firm should be the model object for innovation policy, as it should be for cultural policy. Eltham (2013: 550) argues that the focus of innovation studies on the firm misses what matters most about cultural markets: “The complex interplay of cross-border distribution networks, cultural tariffs and language barriers creates a mosaic of different markets for cultural products that bears little resemblance to the single market, perfectly competitive models […]. This mosaic is as much social, political and linguistic as it is economic.” While this mosaic is here constituted from a nation-state perspective, the metaphor applies equally, and with more force, to the city as the fundamental site of cultural innovation and so to the components of cultural policy.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The city in its diversity of instantiations is the fullest collective representation humans have achieved of their capabilities (and deficiencies) as knowledgable, productive and sociable beings; the postmodern city exemplifies both the incorporation of given world into the human order and, as the scene of cultural heterogeneity and multiplicity, the principle of local diversification of language and culture in the context of globalisation. This conception of the city is being explored in many different ways, particularly in the contexts of globalisation, economic change, and the introduction of digital information and communications technologies. In an assessment of developments and changes in cultural policy in Europe from the 1960s in the context of urban regeneration, Franco Bianchini (1993: 200) has observed that “In the 1970s and 1980s city cultural policies have in many cases been more innovative and based on broader definitions of ‘culture’ than national policies” which have tended to “be imbued with a triumphalist, civilisational notion of European culture and identity, emphasising ‘high’ art and national cultures, rather than popular, local and ethnic cultures.” At the heart of these policies is a “cultural planning perspective rooted in an understanding of local cultural resources and of cities as <i>cultural entities</i> – as places where people meet, talk, share ideas and desires, and where identities and lifestyles are formed” (212). Bianchini proposes that “linking the debate on the future of cities as physical and economic entities to that on the future of citizenship and local democracy” (205) is now a critical task, a view shared and extended by Friedmann in his concept of “multipli/city”, a term which recognises that citizenship is increasingly taking multiple forms – local, national, and transnational – and that this diversity is enacted in and constitutes over time the distinctive character of a specific city. He affirms that “a vibrant civil life is the necessary social context for human flourishing. Multipli/city acknowledges the priority of civil society, which is the sphere of freedom and social reproduction - and it is for its sake that the city can be said to exist” (2002: 112).</p>
<p class="noindent1">To ensure that cities develop in ways which offer the optimum conditions for sustaining human life and the reproduction of society requires innovative action across the spectrum of human needs, grounded in cultural values and principles, the full exercise of democratic citizenship, access to the most extensive resources of knowledge, a private sector able to generate economic value from local innovation and a public sector able to guide, support and resource the development of city-regions.<sup><a id="note62" href="#note_62">62</a></sup> It has been increasingly recognised that the policies for urban regeneration through cultural and arts enterprises which followed and sought to compensate for the globalised shift of manufacturing from established industrial cities to new sites providing cheaper labour and less regulation have had mixed results. A recent analysis of this phase of culturally-led policies and practices for urban renewal asks whether the typical outcome was successful regeneration of local communities and economies, or merely property development. Miles (2013: 28) concludes that “New cultural venues transformed a city’s image through a level of investment lower than that required for the renewal of a social fabric or an economic infrastructure. The shift in image was aimed in any case at external perception, not recognition by a city’s diverse, competing publics. It subsumed diverse realities within a single representation of a future to which the city’s governing commercial and cultural élites aspired.” As he observes, the single representation is in effect a brand (22-23), further evidence of the extent to which commercial ways of thinking have come to dominate all areas of social and economic development, displacing the majority of the publics of a city from any claim to ownership of the city as a space of multiple meanings and practices. Miles asks a question about cities which can also be asked about nations: “to whom [do] they belong? And who was able, or not able to participate in determining the image of a city which reshaped its built and social as well as its economic environment?” (21).</p>
<p class="noindent1">This question has been asked in similar ways in projects which begin with the premise that a city and its region belong to the people who live there and who are integral to its development over time. The Core Cities project in the United Kingdom (<a href="https://www.corecities.com/">https://www.corecities.com/</a>), for example, argues that social and economic renewal begins from local concentrations of energy and knowledge, reversing the top-down approach of centralised government in a democratic nation-state; it aims to work out the implications for planning and for the practice of government of engaging with the people actually living in a place over time as the means of finding solutions for the problems those people are experiencing and, on a larger scale, for the city of which their locality is a part. This way of thinking reverses the approach of neoliberal urban planning, centred on high-value property development and massive infrastructure projects. But to undertake such a reversal requires much new learning, both by citizens and those who would govern. The Core Cities report by Blond and Morrin (2015) is unambiguous on this point: “The complexity of the cultural, organisational, constitutional and legislative forces which underlie the current dysfunctional nature of local-central relationships must be recognised and addressed and the barriers overcome if significant powers are to be transferred and full place-based devolution achieved. All parties to this process must change their assumptions, approach and organisation.” Changing modern habits and assumptions in government requires dispensing with the “prevailing culture between central and local government [which] is based on hierarchy, bureaucracy and models of ‘command and control’” (9), an account which applies just as much to innovation and new knowledge creation as it does to understanding any city from a position within the multitude of cultures of that city, and to the formation of a new cultural policy and a new humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This broad, city-based perspective for cultural policy, which is rooted in conceptions of democratic citizenship and quality of life, opens directly on to H. G. Barnett’s conception of innovation as cultural change, a product of dynamic cultural settings and rich cultural inventories. It also proposes a critical turn away from the global as the point of reference for determining national policies for the evolution of the knowledge society. An innovation policy which grew out of cultural policy would have to give serious consideration to a conception of development as endogenous rather than exogenous as at present. Although no culture is ever simply separate from any other, it evolves in a local ecology which is literally as well as metaphorically the ground of its difference and therefore of its innovative capacity within the global distribution of cultures. As Friedmann has written of the city-region, “To be sustainable [...] the development of city-regions must be firmly based on their own resource complexes. [...] Central to this model is an inclusive, working democracy. Power is decentralized, but there are mechanisms for strong decision-making at the center. The local state in this model is a proactive state that pays attention to the need to preserve and improve the quality of the region’s wealth-creating resource complexes, while striving to encourage innovative thinking and practice without presuming to act as its own entrepreneur in every case” (2002: 30, 37). It is cultural policy which, in principle, can provide the lens through which local cultural difference can be both perceived and magnified, and can empower citizen and civic society action in their own spheres. Just as each of us is a part of many different social groupings, so urban localities participate in many different kinds of governance grouping, at city, region and national levels. Local governance cannot take the place of institutions and agencies with national or international spheres of responsibility; each has its proper domain but must accept primary accountability to their citizens. Bland and Morrin emphasise the need to “recreate a participatory politics through empowering localities and creating a sense of a ‘shared state’” (2015: 7); by contrast, how difficult it is for those in the reaches of national and international government most distant from the localities in which most citizens live to think democratically in this way is made clear by Jacques Rancière in his <i>Hatred of Democracy</i> (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent1">A Demos report which brings many of these issues together in its focus on one city is <i>The Dreaming City</i>. Its emphasis is consistent with Bevir’s (2010: 272). argument in <i>Democratic Governance</i> that postmodern forms of governance need “a more dialogic approach to policy. We may give up management techniques and strategies for a practice of learning by telling stories and listening to them. […] Citizens too can tell stories about their world. Policy can arise out of dialogues and learning among citizens with the state playing a largely facilitative role” The authors of <i>The Dreaming City</i> sought to discover the future possibilities for Glasgow from a close encounter with the ways in which citizens imagined their city, based on a view that “Significant investment has gone into stimulating and supporting economic innovation in cities. There is now a growing need to match this with equivalent investment in social and democratic innovation” (Hassan et al, 2007: 207).</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a most important respect, the report was consulting for evidence sources which in other contexts would be described as fictions deriving from “the most abundant and potent source of new ideas and practices a city has — its people” (44). Understood from this perspective, Glasgow is a city that “feels bigger and more resonant than the physical space it inhabits. In this, Glasgow, like other cities, exists both in reality and as an imagined city of the mind” (75). The questions these researchers asked on behalf of the citizens of Glasgow (but, by extension, cities anywhere), go to the heart of the key issues and motivations for change from which conceptions of city futures can be best formulated: “What kind of cities do we want to live in? Who has the energy and impetus to make change in them happen? How will people be involved in the process of change? What kind of support do they need to help shape their shared futures? These are all political questions” (45). Furthermore, an orientation towards the future requires a particular mode of sociable learning and thinking, only hinted at, for example, in the Foresight methodology discussed in <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter Three</a>. The report defines this mode as futures literacy, which means “thinking imaginatively about the future but also being able to act in the present. […] Becoming a futures-literate city means connecting individual and collective aspirations for the future at a scale and within contexts that people find meaningful and can participate in practically — in neighbourhoods, public spaces and public conversations” (20-21). In this account, the city in its many local contexts is the prime site of creativity and innovation, the locus of “the energy of thought” in all its heterogeneity. One critical dimension of the knowledge resources it draws upon is the embodied experience of its citizens and the knowledge derived from that experience by what Bevir called “local reasoning” (see <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapter Three</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Soja’s perception expressed in the late 1990s of a “general sea change in the very nature of contemporary urban life” (1997: 19) occurring during the last quarter of the twentieth century and his argument for a new conception of the city, the postmetropolis, and a new set of concepts on which to found urban analysis, applies with great exactness to the humanities. The city is like the art system (the work of art, the gallery/museum and the accumulation of knowledge through analysis and critique taken together) as Luhmann describes it, a materialisation of ideas and forms drawing upon the past and transforming them in the process of bringing into collective consciousness what is coming into existence and has not been before. Soja argues that changes in the modern city are so profound that “we can no longer simply add our new knowledge to the old. There are too many incompatibilities, contradictions, disruptions. We must instead radically rethink and perhaps deeply restructure – that is, deconstruct and reconstitute - our inherited forms of urban analysis to meet the practical, political and theoretical challenges presented by the postmetropolis” (21). To make this comparison is not to say that such deep restructurings are not occurring in the humanities, but to argue that the transformations of the postmodern are not just relevant to postmodernists in period study, but that the whole textual corpus of the humanities is reconstituted by the postmodern just as is the city as a textual corpus accumulating and forgetting through time. Furthermore, a city, and not a globalised conception of a discipline, provides the local challenge to the adequacy of humanistic knowledge in that place for that city’s (and its nation’s) self-comprehension and deliberated evolution; that is to say, its cultural policy. And, as I hope I have demonstrated, the challenges are “practical, political and theoretical”, involving conceptions of the work of humanistic knowledge in the everyday orders of social living, the contest of values as well as the politics of knowledge in which its practitioners are engaged, and the conceptual frameworks within which interpretive textual analysis and the search for meaning is carried out.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s4.26"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s4-26">9. Conclusion</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">My purpose in this chapter has been to widen the scope of the discussion of culture and policy in the preceding chapter to include domains of government and society which are of particular importance in considering how cultural policy might be approached when the question of culture and hence of cultural policy is no longer addressed through the arts. To consider that a truly democratic state is first and foremost an education state, and that the foundational policies of such a state are cultural policies, requires an integrative conception of the cultural work of government as it is expressed in public sector agencies and their relations with one another, on the one hand, and the institutions (especially Parliament) by which a democratic society deliberates about and reflects upon itself.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Making education the defining work of a democratic state implies that the fundamental elements constituting the possibility of the social – language, memory, cultural knowledge, communications media and the city – should provide the matrix in which both the work of government and the designing of education and training for that work should be recast. It implies a redefinition and repositioning of work of public sector agencies away from their subordination to the government in power for the time being and towards the public on whose behalf they perform their administrative and knowledge-creating work, work which should be measured against a criterion of public value. It implies a redefinition and repositioning of the city as the engine of culture and innovation, and the replacement of hierarchical conceptions of governance by democratic and participatory processes which engage citizens’ knowledge and experience where they live. It implies a redefinition and repositioning of the role of law and the justice system as the source of negotiated order in society and as motivated by the unending search for the just decision. It implies a redefinition and repositioning of the role of a public media system which is capable through its professional programming of providing access to self-selected life-long learning through world news and encounters with many different kinds of knowledge and entertainment. It implies a redefinition and repositioning of the curriculum and research programme of the academic humanities (including the relations between the humanities and the social sciences) so that the conversion of their present marginal status to a foundational role in the work of government and cultural transformation can be effected.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It matters enormously, therefore, how the government of a nation-state and its public sector participate in a national conversation about the principles informing the on-going evolution and negotiation of the future of the nation and facilitate local exchanges of knowledge by establishing the conditions required for the constructive conduct of such a conversation. It is through cultural policy that these conditions can be established. And a new humanities is needed to provide an overarching analytical and interpretive framework. Just as Bevir is arguing for a change in social scientific modes of thinking and analysis in order to make a new conception within the discipline of political science about political and bureaucratic action possible, which he calls interpretive social science, so am I arguing for the necessity of a new humanities in order to make a foundational conception of cultural policy thinkable, together with a claim for the substantive importance of humanistic knowledge to democratic government.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Achieving a significant change in public sector understanding of the role of the humanistic knowledge in society, including the economy, and hence of the foundational importance of cultural policy, will require at least four closely related achievements:</p>
<p class="blist1"><span class="hang1">1.</span> recentering the institutions of the democratic state on education as the anchor to which all other responsibilities of government are attached;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">2.</span> formulating an inclusive description of the cultural dimension of society and its representation by agencies of the state, including appropriate criteria for measuring and representing the economic value of activity in the various economies characteristic of this dimension;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">3.</span> applying the concept of public value to the assessment of the work of public sector agencies and media systems; and</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="hang1">4.</span> establishing a new conception of advanced knowledge and training in a new humanities (including the creative arts, media and cultural institutions) able to give form to the cognitive and imaginative capabilities needed to comprehend a postmodern democratic society’s possible futures and contribute to their mapping and realisation through policy and public conversation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The abstractions of technocratic discourse provide powerful tools for identifying trends and patterns in social evolution, but they also displace and substitute for the much more textured public conversation which weaves histories, values and beliefs into every concept and proposition about the past, the present and the future. This textured conversation in its heterogeneity (spoken and written) is most fully encountered in cities, and in narrative fiction. Formal and expert knowledge, and the economy, are always elements in fictional representation, but they are typically contained within in a more complex account of human interests and purposes. An education state would build the perceptions of artists in all media into the core of its knowledge work, because such thinkers are society’s early warning system at the level of culture, values and insight, by means of imagination and embeddedness in place, time and collective knowledge occupying the role once occupied by prophets and similarly discounted when their perceptions do not conform with the dominant truth system.<sup><a id="note63" href="#note_63">63</a></sup> It would also take the evolving city and not its subset, the market, as both the primary source of innovation and the test of the competence of its cultural policy.</p>

Milton’s notorious refusal to grant freedom of publication to Catholics (1974: 244) has to be acknowledged, not least because it has been foregrounded locally in a recent article on free speech by Max Rushbrooke (2015). As his discussion shows, context matters in any decision to publish thought or prevent its publication. A good test is one’s response to the use of the word “conspiracy” in the quotation from Nelson and Stolterman, not least because Milton and his contemporaries still had the Gunpowder Plot in mind. For a recent discussion of the Plot’s wide ramifications, see Shapiro (2015). Milton’s response is discussed on 153-154. Are there ideas which can, as such, so threaten the constitutional and legal integrity of a state that their proponents must be silenced, or is external organisational, state or military power supporting such ideas also necessary to justify censorship?</p>

[…] The notion of planning subjects with the purpose of ordering (the future) society requires, among other things, a particular epistemological structuring of agents and agency that can foresee the future through ordering procedures of the present; [,,,] Uncertainty or undecidability stand in the way of progress and thus need to be policed, even in the name of a future democracy.”</p>

In government publications, this sign is also produced back to New Zealanders as the definitive mark of national cultural identity. Media technologies render the image object endlessly repeatable, instantly perceivable and memorable, and deprived of history or politics; these latter dimensions of its operation are only uncoverable when the image is understood to be, not a copy of the real world only but a producer of myth, in Barthes’ sense of the term, and the work of media technologies is understood to be fully implicated in the transmission and hence shaping of cultural knowledge as a political process.</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_35" href="#note35">35</a></sup> Kaldor (2003) identifies the 1980s and 1990s as the period when a nation-state bounded conception of civil society gave way to a concept of global civil society: “The new meaning of civil society involves a process of campaigning, lobbying and struggling for a new generation of rights, including gender, the environment and peace, at global, national and local levels. Global governnce, aframework of overlapping authorities, is being constitued by and helping to constitute global civil society.” She acknowledges that her interpretation emphasises activism: “civil society thus consists of those groups and organizations through which individuals can influence and put pressure on the centres of ploitical and economic authority, in particualr through which they negotiate new social contracts or bargains at a global level.” She also warns of ”the real danger that the new types of warfare [prevalent in the 1980s – network warfare, conducted by networks of state and non-state actors, neo-modern and spectacle warfare conducted by those states which continue to pursue unilateralist policies] will overwhelm civil society. These new types of warfare cannot be contained by territorial borders; the world is no longer divided into zones of war and zones of peace. Nor do these new types end decisively. On the contrary, they generate extremist ideologies, fear and hate on which such ideologies thrive, as well as a global criminalized economy with a vested interest in extremism”(143. 146, 147}</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_49" href="#note49">49</a></sup> Cunningham (1994: 6) writes that “the bureaucracy is in an inextricable ‘feedback loop’ with the social fields of political-cultural activity. [...] governmental processes are constitutive but not determinative.”</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_51" href="#note51">51</a></sup> Chandra (2013: 94-95) writes that “it is no coincidence that the first classrooms in which the English novel was studied were located in colonial universities in India. The task of turning Indians into proper modern subjects with the right sort of interiority, reflexivity, and individuality demanded that the most sophisticated technology of selfhood be brought into play, and of course this instrument was the modern novel.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_52" href="#note52">52</a></sup> Latour’s (2004) brilliant reconstitution of democracy takes these points further, arguing for “a new assembly of humans and nonhumans […] To limit the discussion to humans, their interests, their subjectivities, and their rights, will appear as strange a few years from now as having denied the right to vote of slaves, poor people, or women. […] there are millions of subtle mechanisms capable of adding new voices to the chorus ” (69). Where I have taken “conversation” as the summary term for informed communication between citizens, Latour considers in detail discussion (65), controversy (66), propositions (83), and articulation (86) as important dimensions of speech in this assembly.</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_54" href="#note54">54</a></sup> The move in New Zealand from a first past the post to a mixed member proportional system for electing Parliament was an important step in this direction, however disliked by the established parties and however much it has been used to frustrate progressive policy development. As with law-making which is unproductive unless it goes together with extensive public education, a change to electoral procedures by itself does not make a more representative Parliament or change the habits of inherited parliamentary practice.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_55" href="#note55">55</a></sup> A brilliant imagining of this state of affairs as an alternative history of the Victorian period is the novel by Gibson and Sterling (1990), The Difference Engine.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_56" href="#note56">56</a></sup> The vulture funds are a notable current example of these characteristics.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_57" href="#note57">57</a></sup> Milton’s qualification, not just any man but good men, establishes a moral discipline on the work of intellect which is an important correlative of his argument for freedom from censorship by the state.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_58" href="#note58">58</a></sup> Castells (2012: 222) provides an updated view of the same conditions when he writes that “The space of the movement is always made of an interaction between the space of flows on the Internet and wireless communication networks, and the space of places of the occupied sites and of symbolic buildings targeted by the protest actions. This hybrid of cyberspace and urban space constitutes a third space that I call the space of autonomy. This is because autonomy can only be insured by the capacity to organize in the free space of communication networks, but at the same time can only be exercised as a transformative force by challenging the disciplinary institutional orders by reclaiming the space of the city for its citizens.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_59" href="#note59">59</a></sup> Popelard and Vannier (2015) argue that the history of Panama City’s development foreshadows the way in which, “Now mobile and globalised, [capital] is turning states and their capital cities into instruments for guaranteeing and supporting its movements.”</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_60" href="#note60">60</a></sup> Hayles’s emphasis on the emergent nature of text, and her use of biological metaphors, like ecology and environment, encourages the application of her concept of the computer as a “material-semiotic machine” to the city as the most fully equivalent location for the experience of reading electronic text. See for example de Certeau (1984), “Walking in the City.” The term “semiosphere” is consequently also relevant for thinking about the “space” containing cities as ”material-semiotic machines” which is generated and sustained by texts in all media and languages. A city is a local site of the semiosphere.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_61" href="#note61">61</a></sup> An excellent example is Gibson’s 1986 story, ‘The Gernsback Continuum’, in the collection <i>Burning Chrome</i>. See Burrows (1997).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note_62" href="#note62">62</a></sup> John Friedmann (2002: 22) provides an extended discussion of these issues. He defines a city-region as “a functionally integrated area consisting of both a large urban core and a contiguous region that serves this city’s multiple needs and provides a space for its expansion. . . . Within this complex, the traditional distinction between urban and rural ceases to be meaningful. The whole of the city-region has, in fact, become a new form of urban landscape.” This physical territorial extension of the city needs to be complemented by its extension in virtual space. See Graham (1997) and McBeath and Webb (1997).</p>
