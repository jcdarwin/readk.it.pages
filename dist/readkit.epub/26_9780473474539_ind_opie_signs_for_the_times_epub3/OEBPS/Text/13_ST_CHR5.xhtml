<p class="noindent1">“to discover onward things more remote from our knowledge” (Milton, 1974: 235)</p>
<p class="noindent2">In a world under the hegemony of science and scientism, it should come as a surprise to find that the epigraph to this chapter is the work of a poet, political and theological radical, and public servant, and that his conception of discovery is founded in literature and the unending reworking of the body of inherited and new knowledge by the energetic application of educated and liberated minds. If for Milton it was the authoritarian mix of theology, church and monarchy (and then Parliament) which imperilled the search for truth and placed humanistic enquiry on the margins, today the same effect has been accomplished by the mix of science, business and the democratic state.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Try to imagine any government instituting a Humanities Strategy as a “whole of government” approach to the knowledge society. That it is so counter-intuitive, so Utopian, so productive only of a “meere fiction”<sup><a id="note_1" href="#note1">1</a></sup>, marks how far the routine ways for imagining the work of government with and for knowledge have become habituated to the claims of the techno-sciences and conventional measurements of their economic value. To emphasise that the present settlement about knowledge is an imaginary construct, based on the promotion and public acceptance of claims and specific value propositions, is to bring the politics underpinning this settlement into the foreground. As I have noted earlier, whatever scientists might think about the self-evident, even overwhelming, value of their work, it can be sustained and publicly funded only if the public is, and continues to be, convinced of its importance; and this is a fundamentally political and rhetorical process. In an analysis of the changing context for science in postmodernity, Gibbons et al (2001: 189) note that</p>
<p class="quote">Popular images of science represent a vital link between scientific culture and the general culture of society […] Yet these images, by their very nature, blur what scientists call ‘facts’ with ‘fiction’, the products of the human imagination. It is by means of such blurring that they bridge the gap between science and society.</p>
<p class="noindent1">From another angle, this statement is directly applicable to the humanities, and to literature in particular. I have already discussed the invisibility of the humanities in public discourse, their spectral existence as the other to the sciences now hinted at through their fragmentary presence in various of the social sciences, and by the resolute incompatibility of indigenous knowledges. It is equally useful to think of the humanities as “blurred” in another way – rendered out of focus by the dominant knowledge system of science and associated with popular rather than with rigorous knowledge, personal and private rather than objective and economically valuable knowledge, the past rather than the future of society. And within the modern humanities, a similar blurring obscures the knowledge work of “literature” (which I now take to refer to all those academic disciplines which are founded on the study of overtly fictional texts) in official accounts of the purposes and outcomes of research.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Milton’s epigraph to this chapter captures succinctly the Baconian ethos of modern science as an exploratory and progressive expansion of the known into the territory of the unknown, vividly represented by the visual metaphor of a ship sailing through the Pillars of Hercules into the open space of the ocean (and the future) before it which illustrates the title page to Bacon’s <i>Novum Organon Scientiarum</i> (see <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a>). This metaphor still underpins the public representation of scientific and technological discovery, even if the mode of transport has become a spaceship and the Pillars of Hercules are now located on the edge of the solar system or erected precariously on the margins of black holes. But for Milton the material real included the spiritual as well as the physical orders of creation, and “onward things” were discoverable by theological and poetic as well as philosophical and scientific enquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The dominant model of scientific discovery now uses the wonders of the physical universe as captured in sublime images by instruments like the Hubble telescope or the Large Hadron Collider as a powerful rhetorical tool in its promotion of its social value; as Gibbons et al put it, “they bridge the gap between science and society.”<sup><a id="note_2" href="#note2">2</a></sup> And, of course, there could hardly be more powerful visual metaphors, macro- and micro-cosmic, for “things more remote”. But can such images convey knowledge as well as wonder and awe? What process of translation from image into language, beginning with a caption but hardly stopping there, is required? In this as in many other domains of twenty-first century information and communication technologies, the image silences a thousand words, rather than productively stands in for them. Images were condemned by Reformation Protestants as “laymen’s books” and, however important visualisation has become in communication and research, the ancient debate between the sister arts of poetry (linguistic) and painting (visual) has not been resolved, not least because many of the significant developments in digital technologies, especially for general use, have emphasised increasing fidelity to the multimedia characteristics of human sense perception while being dominated by the visual. But knowledge as such, when objectified, is properly represented by the abstractions of alphanumeric, diagrammatic, and diacritical signs and the formal grammatical, syntactical and generic rules for their combination, in the broad spectrum of disciplined modes of writing, the poles of which (as I will discuss below) are mathematics and poetry.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s5.1"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-1">1. Othering the Techno-sciences</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">I have argued that the scope of a new or postmodern humanities is delimited only by its objects of investigation and interpretation, that is, the contents of the semiosphere or, to decompress that designation, all written objects created in whatever medium and whatever language. My aim in this chapter is to locate one particular set of objects within the totality of the semiosphere on which the claim that a (new) humanities contributes to fundamental innovation and new knowledge creation most fully depends.</p>
<p class="noindent1">My argument seeks to position a new humanities not as a remnant of an earlier phase in the evolution of human knowledge but as the postmodern other to science in the discovery of “things more remote”, despite lacking the resources of rhetorical, technological, and economic power currently enjoyed by techno-science. Now that the empire of modern western science has claimed absolute authority over the realm of the real (however demarcated), and the realm of the gods has been relegated to the domain of the imaginary (as much an aim of secular humanism as of science), what territories of innovation in knowledge worth having are left for the humanities to claim? Practically, as the situation of the humanities in Aotearoa New Zealand has demonstrated, there would appear to be none. As I have argued earlier (<a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a>) there is an exact analogy between the situation of indigenous knowledges in relation to modern science, and that of the humanities. In both cases, a progressivist ideology of knowledge consigns other methodologies and modes of relation to the real to the limbo of irrelevance and error. Furthermore, customary claims to territory, literally and metaphorically, can be evacuated by money power directing the stroke of a lawmaker’s pen.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One reason for discounting the value of knowledge created by the humanities is that the binaries structuring modern knowledge work – body/mind; imagination/reason; subjectivity/objectivity; fictionality/reality; narratorial/analytical; recollective/progressive; reflexive/denotative; value laden/value free; qualitative/quantitative; public good/private good – exert a very powerful influence over the valuation of different kinds of knowledge, and the objects of knowledge. The academic humanities in general would still largely place themselves discursively on the right side of the first five of these binaries, but to varying degrees on the left of the last five, partly depending on whether they can also be categorised as social sciences, for example, in research assessment exercises or grant allocation procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put another way, the most crucial difference which consigns humanistic enquiry to the margins of modern knowledge creation is the object of enquiry. Just as the objects, states, forces and happenings of the given world or the physical universe are the focus of scientific investigation, so are the objects, states, forces and events of the human world the focus of humanistic investigation. Obviously the science set and the humanistic set overlap, the common factor being the materiality of the objects in both sets, including the materiality of human beings. The difference lies in part in the contextualising of any object: is the context in which this piece of stone is apprehended constituted by other rocks, as in geology, or by its social uses (a bank, a sculpture, an altar), or by meanings and associations which it has in a culture and which attach as signifieds to the signifiers which represent it discursively (marble, jade, granite)? The most defining difference, however, is whether an object carries inscriptions of any kind, that is, intentional marks addressed to another capable of interpreting those marks as communicative. Samuel Butler claimed when writing as Lunaticus to <i>The Press</i> in Christchurch (New Zealand) in 1863 “that no other animal but man has hit upon the intentional tacking of its mind onto matter, and without this no intellectual development and consequently no material development is possible. […] Whatever has tended to promote this matrimonial alliance of mind with mind will be found to have been attended with material progress; and nothing has been found so real and permanent a parent of good solid material welfare, as those things which have increased the facility of the interchange of thought, experience and opinion” (Jones 1959: 198-199). As I have argued in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a>, this class of objects (texts) constitutes a distinct or supplemental sphere in relation to the material order of things; the semiosphere is not given but made by human effort and thought drawing on the resources of culture, supplemental to the given world if culture is either regarded as attributing meaning to that which has no inherent meaning or as one way of making the hidden intelligibility of the given world and ourselves accessible to thought and consciousness.</p>
<p class="noindent1">All texts (semiotic objects) are instances of culture and, because they have been produced by human beings, provide evidence for the fundamental enquiry about ourselves which is focussed by the question, What does it mean to be human? The intellectual and cultural capabilities which make modern scientific investigation of the physical universe possible and which are manifested in scientific texts and other kinds of technological object, and the on-going revelation of these capabilities over time as the project of techno-science evolves, provide a crucial dimension of the evidence for an elaborating answer to that question, just as do other facets of social activity, like education, law, business, religion, medicine, politics, war, agriculture, the arts and crafts, and sport. It is the task of the new or postmodern humanities to investigate the world of the semiosphere, micro-cosmically and macro-cosmically.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s5.2"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-2">2. Creation, creative, creativity</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Recently in knowledge policy the terms create, creation and creativity have been appropriated by the techno-sciences from the creative arts. As I have discussed earlier, the university remains the most vivid institutional example of the current version of the power-knowledge relation disadvantageous to humanistic knowledge, in which the work of the creative arts can be linked with the work of science under the sign of creativity and innovation but not also through a claim to be discovering new knowledge. How artistic creativity and critique could be understood to be partners with science in the creation of new knowledge rather than as a decorative extension of science is a mystery at the core of the modern western university.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Because this formation of “the university” came to regard its work as a scientific process of forming true knowledge of that which was outside it, that is, the physical universe and human society, subsequently identifying the creative arts and media outside the university as proper objects of the work of academic reason inside the institution made very good sense. But there is a further parallel; just as the scientific and technological work of creating new things in the physical universe has entered the university from industry, in research centres, laboratories, and incubators, so has the work of creating new artistic objects come within it, in creative writing programmes, film, television and theatre schools, music composition, design and fine art, video games and so on.<sup><a id="note_3" href="#note3">3</a></sup> That creativity is now claimed as strongly for science as for the arts is a significant index of the extent to which knowledge of all kinds has become the most powerful means for transforming physical, social and mental worlds in conformity with (some) human conceptions and desires; but the reciprocal claim for the creative arts, that they produce not only economic value (media industries, crafts, education, entertainment and tourism) but also new knowledge beyond that occurring in specific media and craft technological development, has yet to be recognised, especially in public policies for knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the dominant method now informing the deliberated creation of new knowledge about the given world is based on hypothesis, experiment, instrumentation and logical deduction, and the dominant method informing the deliberated creation of new knowledge in culture is based on axiom, experience, instrumentation and abduction, it is not surprising that the creative arts remain largely unassimilated in knowledge policy. The important distinction between these different routes to new knowledge is not whether one has a better claim to the term “creative” than the other, but in the relation between the object of knowledge and the structured process whereby knowledge is generated about or from it. In culture, because there is no outside to the semiosphere and both the object of analysis and the means for presenting the outcome of that analysis are textual (semiotic objects), the scope and dimensions of creativity and invention are as manifold as are the scope and dimensions of the semiosphere. As a subset of the semiosphere, the texts produced by the creative arts, which I will term aesthetic texts, are of unique importance to the new humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Towards the end of Powers’ novel, <i>Orfeo</i>, the composer Peter Els is listening to a song cycle on his car radio. He identifies the sources as “Peter Lieberson, Pablo Neruda. But such names are at best composite pseudonyms. These phrases assembled over centuries, the work of more anonymous day laborers than history will ever credit. You’re in there yourself, down a branch of the self-spreading Net, stepfather of a fleeting mood of modulation, vector for new infections” (2014: 360-361). If the art system is distinguished from other systems in postmodern societies by its ability “to accept multiple descriptions of complexity”, (Luhmann, 2000: 306), then we might say that it is also most fully open to the actual and potential expansiveness and heterogeneity (the democracy) of the “self-spreading Net”. Els imagines that he will continue to exist not as a personal name but as a form, a new element in musical composition which extends what can be thought and imagined musically and is capable, like any objectified knowledge, of being used for new purposes in new contexts with or without attribution. Here, in this single capsule, is a theory and means of innovation at its greatest generality and in its greatest humility; enquiring further into it is the purpose of the rest of this chapter. The matter with which creativity works is the stuff of global conversation, its collective recollection in the semiosphere, and its selective aggregation by cultural inventories, given form by singular persons but recollecting almost none of them by name; the widest opening to the possibility of new knowledge and understanding is through singular attentiveness to that conversation in its diversity of cultural forms and languages, and through inventions – the exemplary case being artworks – which can generate for their users imaginative spaces for the contemplation and modelling of the to-come, and through whom it can be embodied by persons and texts in local times and places, in the process modifying reality. The principal value of innovations in thinking derives not from their monetising but from the ways in which they can provide new openings on to the question, what does it mean to be human?</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s5.3"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-3">3. Focusing in the cultural field</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Within the disciplines making up the modern humanities, the standing of those concerned with aesthetic texts is ambiguous. What kinds of knowledge result from research into and with aesthetic texts, in the fields of literature studies, media studies (journalism, photography, film, radio, television, digital media), art history, classics, design, music, performance arts and digital arts, given the distinctive character of the objects studied by these disciplines? As singular compositions (whether individual or group authored, edited and designed, and however multiply reproduced) combining subjectively elements from anywhere in the semiosphere, in any language and any medium, aesthetic texts share an absolutely distinguishing characteristic, the fundamentally constitutive roles of mediality and fictionality in their composition. I have already argued in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a> that the semiosphere defines the scope and kinds of objects in relation to which humanities enquiry is knowledge-creating work and have sought to distinguish in <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapters Three</a> and <a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Four</a> between culture as the creative and performing arts and culture as the totality of a social group’s meanings and values concerning the life-world. While the latter defines the kinds of knowledge with which the humanities are (and always have been) concerned as both conservers and innovators, during the twentieth century some artists (and scientists) have directly challenged the conventions of representation naturalising realism which underpin conceptions of “established reality” (Luhmann 2000a: 144) in Western cultures. It is by means of this challenge that the humanities become fully capable of creating innovative knowledge. As Luhmann (2000a: 17-18) puts it, “Art renders accessible what is invisible without it. […] Is it conceivable that art, as a kind of ‘writing,’ builds a bridge between perception and communication […]?” Its innovative work of rendering is accomplished through media forms rather than discursively; it is the work of the humanities informed by critical, textual and cultural theory to translate into discursive forms what the arts make accessible to perception and consciousness, that is, into new knowledge. Innovation in the humanities, which reaches out into all spheres of culture and society, depends most completely on works of art which open thought to what is yet to be known, and which reflexively engage the knowledge they make possible in the creation of new artworks. Clearly, this relationship is constituted by an exemplary subset of the whole range of texts categorised, on the one hand, as aesthetic texts, and on the other, as academic humanities texts. Both kinds would be properly described by Bernstein’s term, “difficult”. It is on the foundation of the objects constituting the category of innovative aesthetic texts that I want to build this last stage of my argument for a new humanities as a project for “discover[ing] onward things more remote from our knowledge.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">The three marks of difference which I have identified in order to constitute a subset of texts (aesthetic texts) within the totality of the semiosphere<sup><a id="note_4" href="#note4">4</a></sup>, and hence within the totality of the humanities – singularity, mediality, and fictionality – are the marks which, in the modern period, have been used to diminish or deny truth claims deriving from the citation and interpretation of these texts. Knowledge, as modern science creates it or modern philosophy identifies it, is marked by its universality, its independence of the medium by which it is communicated or in which it is stored, and its dissociation from any interference from or dependence upon the subjectivity and cultural location of the scientist or the philosopher. Reading for informational content is the current dominant mode of reading; but reading for the factors of singularity, mediality and fictionality (which are also constituent characteristics to some degree of any text) widens a text’s evidential potential because such reading exposes its contextual – cultural, institutional and subjective - embeddedness to analysis and understanding. It allows one to ask not only, what does this text know, but also why, when, where and to whom does this knowledge matter. A text which emphasises its referentiality, that it should be understood as existing only in order to represent and communicate some aspect of the real world wholly outside it and in relation to which it entirely effaces itself (the text as window), will necessarily work to suppress any indications of authorial singularity, mediality, or fictionality; whereas an aesthetic text, which exists so that the imagined world given existence by its means can be conserved and recreated in the minds of those who encounter it in times and places other than that in which it was composed, claims these characteristics as integral to its purpose and value.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s5.4"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-4">3.1 Fictionality and Mediality</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Traditionally, fictionality is distinguished from other modes of representation by the exploration of what is possible or potential in narrative forms claiming a likeness to the real world but not basing a claim to value on the literal truth of that likeness. In the order of truth defined by science, no truth claim can be made on the evidence of a fictional representation; and yet fictionality is a constitutive component of the textual objects making up the category of creative arts and therefore part of the corpus of the modern humanities, and they are socially and economically important in education and entertainment, not least because they can foreground and make accessible to thought and self-awareness differences among systems of cultural values and beliefs. Offering ways of thinking outside the taken-for-granted of ordinary experience and the calculations of government, education and business, fictions can activate those capabilities of human subjectivity and cognition which can challenge the assumed limits of the real by asking “what if?”, by forming mental models and narratives of alternative forms of living, thinking and knowing and using them to critique the present order of society and its official knowledge. In some circumstances, collective human action based on such acts of imaginative and collaborative mental building through texts of possible worlds can be transformative of social reality and the given world.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Of course, asking “what if?” is not the uniquely distinctive property of fiction writers; it is a humanly characteristic way of orienting thought towards possibility, that which is outside the taken-for-granted. In both dimensions of reality (social reality and the given world) the power of techno-scientific knowledge is now most fully expressed in its capacity to create new things, biological as well as technological, for which the idea or model (the “what if?”) precedes the new thing. Baudrillard (1994: 1-42) has argued that the entry to postmodernity is marked by the “precession of simulacra”, a cultural and social condition in which the power of modern knowledge has advanced to such a degree that it is able to transform nature itself, a stage beyond the invention of technologies as prosthetic extensions and magnifications of human powers. The project of shaping nature to serve human interests is an ancient one, manifesting itself more recently, for example, in the conversion of the pre-colonial natural order of New Zealand into landscapes and townscapes signifying European conceptions of productivity and civilisation. But for Baudrillard contemporary advances in scientific knowledge make available to human agency a power much greater than that required to transfer a known order into a new territory. In a precise application of a metaphor exemplifying the transformative process of imperial expansion across the planet to the condition of postmodern knowledge, he has argued that now it is “the map that precedes the territory.” (1994: 1) What humans can desire and conceive has left the realm of the imaginary, the ideal, the fantastic, the utopian, and is now expressed in simulations as blueprints of new realities to be produced by manipulating nature and human nature. A fine and satirical example of a fictional analysis of the application of these powers to reality transformation is Jeff Noon’s <i>Automated Alice</i>, in which the government of a future Manchester employs “Djinnetic Engineering” with the aim of producing a pliant population, but with startling and unanticipated results.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Put this way, the crucial issue raised by the term fictionality is not that of misrepresentation or the distortion of the real as such by the imposition of a deviant subjectivity, but the means available to thought for thinking differently, and having “real world” effects. These means are inevitably political because they include values, beliefs, ideologies, histories and laws, and their enactment is civil, most fully in the collectivity of the city. The circuit from the mind to the real through the fictional text and politics can be transformative of the real; at least, all that of the real which it is possible for human thought to represent, modify or seek to make new. In other words, extending the scope of the term creativity to embrace the sciences as well as the creative arts blurs the borders of the binary fiction/reality while also extending the zone of fiction to include both art and technological objects.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In so far as a socially transformative or educative purpose has been traditionally claimed for art, literature, music and theatre, and that this work is to be accomplished typically with fictional means, it is clear that the period of the postmodern marks a convergence between this capability of aesthetic texts and the simulations created from techno-scientific knowledge. In both cases, the basis of this convergence is the belief that a mental conception (an idea) can have a transformative effect in the real; once again, this belief is a foundation for the meaning of the term “innovation” which, until recently, applied to changes in political, intellectual, legal and theological thinking and their social consequences. So, two key terms in the postmodern policy frameworks of western governments, creativity and innovation, conceal fictionality at their core.</p>
<p class="noindent1">They also conceal mediality, the quality of a text deriving from the materiality of the medium in which it is composed and transmitted. The twentieth century has witnessed an astonishing elaboration of media power, through the development of mass media organisations in news, telephone, radio, music, film, and television, and their full convergence in the globalised systems of networked digital information and communications technologies and the corporations which own them. As these technologies – cognitive machines with increasing capabilities for intervention in the subjective worlds of their users on behalf of their creators and designers – have evolved, so has their attempt to disguise their power by association with scientific canons of the real, the claim that technologies are value free, and the traditional denial of mediality by encouraging the belief that the screen is transparent, a window onto reality rather than a critical factor in the work of representation. By contrast, the kinds of aesthetic texts which matter in my claims for the creative arts in the creation of new knowledge are those which are conscious of their mediality and work to disrupt transparency in the act of giving form to value-laden thinking. If the products of globalised media systems are simulations, they are also aesthetic texts promoting and disseminating the systems’ values; but by denying mediality, and by linking fictionality with entertainment, such texts enter and work to transform reality in ways that the human subjects of such transformations may not recognise.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A wonderful anticipation of this position is also a fine imitation of the genre of traditional humanistic scholarship. In a story, “Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius”, which is perfectly attentive to the textual voice (“rigorous prose” (2)) and procedure of the scholar investigating texts, discovering their real world relationships and drawing out meanings from their objective characteristics in a collaborative process of interpretation, Borges reveals the lineaments of modes of thinking of a world profoundly foreign to those investigating it. But however foreign, analysis of the evidence of its languages as well as other information recorded in an encyclopedia makes it possible for them to comprehend the logic and coherence of those foreign modes of thought. Trying to locate a country, Uqbar, with a literature which “never referred to reality, but to the two imaginary regions of Mlenjas and Tlön”, the narrator/investigator acquires a copy of <i>A First Encyclopedia of Tlön. Vol XI. Hlaer to Jangr</i>. This volume is received as “a vast methodical fragment of an unknown planet's entire history”, its scope evidence that it could not be the invention of one mind. The story explores what is distinctive about Tlön, expanding on the implications of an initial observation: “The nations of this planet are congenitally idealist. Their language and the derivations of their language - religion, letters, metaphysics - all presuppose idealism. The world for them is not a concourse of objects in space; it is a heterogeneous series of independent acts. It is successive and temporal, not spatial.” Furthermore, because “Centuries and centuries of idealism have not failed to influence reality”, the act of thinking a thing can make it real. The rest of the encyclopedia is finally discovered; it is learned that Tlön is the invention of a secret society, and that the task of inventing a country, or a world, requires centuries. But it is the consequence of media dissemination (journalistic, in this case) of knowledge about Tlön which comes to preoccupy the narrator, because people’s fascination with this world progressively brings it into existence, displacing present reality: “How could one do other than submit to Tlön, to the minute and vast evidence of an orderly planet? It is useless to answer that reality is also orderly. Perhaps it is, but in accordance with divine laws - I translate: inhuman laws - which we never quite grasp. Tlön is surely a labyrinth, but it is a labyrinth devised by men, a labyrinth destined to be deciphered by men.” In a further hundred years, “someone will discover the hundred volumes of the Second Encyclopedia of Tlön. [...] The world will be Tlön.” Baudrillard’s analysis confirms this fictional anticipation; both are strongly aware of the dangers resident in the human power to modify reality and a totalitarian desire for order and symmetry, but both also accept that the mental/textual action of prefiguring new possibilities and then modifying reality in terms of that prefiguration are integral to human social action. A more recent example is William Gibson’s invention of the term “cyberspace” in <i>Neuromancer</i> (1984). As Hayles observes:</p>
<p class="quote">The Neuromancer trilogy gave a local habitation and a name to the disparate spaces of computer simulations, networks, and hypertext windows that, before Gibson’s intervention, had been discussed as separate phenomena. Gibson’s novels acted like seed crystals thrown into a supersaturated solution; the time was ripe for the technology known as cyberspace to precipitate into public consciousness (1999: 38).</p>
<p class="noindent1">What I am concerned to argue here is that postmodern western societies (and others) are experiencing a process of profound collective mental transformation which is being effected through the fictions projected most widely now by digital media technologies. Such transformative processes have traditionally been associated with and accomplished by the arts, the school, the court of law and the pulpit but have now been magnified enormously in their technological power and reach to modify the thinking of their subjects. At the same time, they have been largely cut loose from the social motives, moral frameworks, public interests and civilising imperatives directing those traditional cultural institutions (however compromised by conservatism and the control of elites), to be directed overtly instead by commercial motives and private interests for private ends. Science fiction is a critical generic development in this context because it reveals the whole spectrum of fictional thinking, from “hard” science fiction in which futures are projected in absolute accordance with current scientific knowledge, to “space opera” and fantasy in which fictional futures (and pasts) are freely invented without such constraint. Such narratives are a generic correlative (and often a critique) of a progressive ideology of knowledge and social evolution; and they are frequently the first place in which the potentials in scientific knowledge for the transformation of the real are made available for more general thought and so enter the conversation of society. Jameson argues that “the most characteristic SF does not seriously attempt to imagine the ‘real’ future of our social system. Rather, its multiple mock futures serve the quite different function of transferring our own present into the determinate past of something yet to come. It s this present moment – unavailable to us for contemplation in its own right because the sheer quantitative immensity of objects and individual lives it comprises is untotalizable and hence unimaginable, and also because it is occluded by the density of our private fantasies as well as of the proliferating stereotypes of a media culture that penetrates every remote zone of our existence – that upon our return from the imaginary constructs of SF is offered to us in the form of some future world’s remote past, as if posthumous and collectively remembered (2005:288).</p>
<p class="noindent1">From another perspective, envisagings in print and pre-electronic visual media of possible futures have given, by being remediated in moving image and now digital media, the effect of reality to a collectively shared image repertoire. The conventions of print technology and the linguistic medium, and the vagaries of individuals’ private imaginative renderings, are replaced by the seamlessly detailed and fixed forms of collectively witnessed multimedia narrative in the society of the spectacle, powerfully enhanced by computer graphics. An exemplary “local” example is Sir Peter Jackson’s <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy. The same shift applies to our knowledge of the “real” past, a multiplicity of worlds only conventionally more real than the future because of the physical remnants of the past which are still present and with which the effect of reality can be composed, using the power of multimedia to generate compelling images of possibly real worlds. This is not to argue that the past did not happen, but that our knowledge of its actuality is increasingly shaped by the power of twenty-first century media to confer the <i>effect</i> of reality on narratives in which speculation and invention play critical but often disguised roles (the recent popularity of the English Tudor period for television series is just one example). In one respect, this is nothing other than the updating of conventions applying to classical history writing, in which the historian was permitted to invent what was not otherwise recorded anywhere, for example, the speeches attributed to historical actors. But that was a permission consistent with the formal relation to truth of rhetoric and poetry, not history written according to the canons of scientific objectivity, documentary evidence and pictorial realism. It was accepted that history writing (as we might also note of future writing), is silently or openly shaped by historians’ purposes and the audience(s) for whom they write, in whatever media form.</p>
<p class="noindent1">My claim that fictionality and mediality are inescapable components of all forms of communication is intended to reframe a position stated powerfully by Bacon when, in the process of sifting the inherited body of knowledge for what was true in it, he determined the conventions of scientific communication and scientific thinking by identifying how knowledge became corrupted by the infiltration of anthropocentric perspectives, human desires and beliefs. By using a powerful Reformation term for intellectual hygiene, the term “idol”, he sought to define an experimental method and linguistic procedure which would completely divorce the pursuit of truth from those innate human and inherited cultural characteristics which deranged it.<sup><a id="note_5" href="#note5">5</a></sup> His list of idols – of the tribe, the cave, the market and the (academic lecture) theatre - is compelling, because it takes into account every dimension of human thought and action that is expressive of what it means to be human. It is only now, in the postmodern reaction against the totalising of the scientific project, that Bacon’s idols are being rehabilitated, so to speak, so that the distinctively human contribution to evolution can be more adequately comprehended.<sup><a id="note_6" href="#note6">6</a></sup> While modern science continues to define itself in part against them (creationism being one example, organics being another), a differently purposeful account is being given which brings the humanities, as the domain of knowledge which conserves them and studies their products and effects, back into play. Thirdspace, the space of the real-and-imagined city, is a positive conceptualisation of the cultural space located pejoratively by the idols.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make the humanity of the thinker vanish, leaving only the thought, is a sign of the presence of truth - and of horror, because such a representation proffers a world devoid of humanity, a world of black holes and dark matter. But this is a dimension of reality and truth; the universe does not run according to human will or sentiment, even if that is one version of the ultimate aspiration driving the work of acquiring knowledge. It is also not the only dimension. Thomas Nagel in <i>Mind and Cosmos</i> argues axiomatically for a secular conception of evolution which includes an inherent relationship between the given world and the human mind: “The intelligibility of the world is no accident. Mind, in this view, is doubly related to the natural order. Nature is such as to give rise to conscious beings with minds; and is such as to be comprehensible to such beings. Ultimately, such beings should therefore be comprehensible to themselves” (2012: 17). One of the distinguishing characteristics of such beings is that they are “value-sensitive agent[s]” (113), but the evolution of a domain of value is not, as Nagel points out, a simply benign development, because it has generated good and evil, and the proliferation of complexity (122). He argues that “The inescapable fact that has to be accommodated in any complete conception of the universe is that the appearance of living organisms has eventually given rise to consciousness, perception, desire, action, and the formation of beliefs and intentions on the basis of reasons. […] what a theory of everything has to explain [is] not only the emergence from a lifeless universe of reproducing organisms and their development by evolution to greater and greater functional complexity; not only the consciousness of some of those organisms and its central roles in their lives; but also the development of consciousness into an instrument of transcendence that can grasp objective reality and objective value” (32, 85).</p>
<p class="noindent1">To make, therefore, the humanity of the thinker visible as an active component of thought describes a fundamental kind of knowledge work. A spectrum is thus constituted in which scientifically generated knowledge is only one segment of the totality of human knowledge - as I have previously described it, only one territory in the world of the semiosphere. Bacon’s project, to sift the wheat from the chaff in the semiosphere of his time, affirmed a criterion which has been rigorously observed by modern science, even though there is presumably no necessary linkage between science and a progressivist philosophy, capitalism or democracy. But the forces now enmeshing humanity in crises of various kinds – environmental, economic, political, ethnic, ideological, religious – which are in part contributed to by the applications of techno-scientific knowledge (notably by advanced weaponry) and for which that knowledge by itself has no solution – are requiring a much more value- and culture-centred approach to the formation and application of knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have argued in <a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter Four</a> that Parliament is the representative scene of the conversation among the members of a democratic society, providing the means for its temporary condensation into law and regulation if its intended function is not disrupted by special interests, deliberate misrepresentation or corruption. Parliament in this view should represent not the power of the state (as the institutions a society establishes for its on-going governance) but the power of the public to shape the direction, purpose and conception of the state in its plurality of functions. The social domain in which, outside of Parliament, the conversation of society is most intensively carried on is the city, which is marked by the intense concentration in a territorial location of the key infrastructures for the transport and exchange of people, ideas and goods, and is therefore the scene of political organisation. Creating knowledge in the humanities involves thinking humanity together with society, of which the economy is only a subset, regarding culture as interactive with the vastness of the given world and constitutive of the real, not subordinate to it, recognising that collective and personal memory is fundamental to the possibility of human futures, and embracing the city (actual and virtual) as the local scene and engine of knowledge creation. The critical relationships continually re-thought in and by the humanities are those connecting singular human beings with culture and environment in different spaces and times, society in its distinctive forms of other people, clusterings of values and beliefs, and the city, and the justice and violence of the state. They are brought to exploratory thought most fully by aesthetic texts.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s5.5"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-5">3.2 Thinking with and through aesthetic texts</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The complex way in which an aesthetic text intersects with a subset of society in a moment of its performance is finely narrated in Powers’ <i>Orfeo</i> (243-255), when the composer, Peter Els, goes into a café at what had been his university and becomes aware that the music playing on the café’s speaker system is his own composition. Through an extended description of the piece’s development the narrator interpellates fragments of the different ways the piece is heard, or not heard, by those in the café, and especially the diverse moments of awareness, anticipation and reflection which give the reader access to Els’s mindlife. The most interesting couple to Els are themselves music students, one of whom is annoyed by being distracted from concentrating on the score of his own composition, and the other who allows herself to become absorbed by the music and cannot quite connect her knowledge of it to its composer sitting at the next table. While the recorded piece retains its integrity, whatever the social context of its performance, how it is apprehended is as various and as accidental as the singular histories and states of mind and feeling of the people who happen to be present at the moment of its performance. The strange conjunction of times and places which the music effects is exemplified by Els: “The glimpse of open ocean, at six minutes, lasts no more than a few sustained measures. When the splendor passes, it beaches Els again in this place, a visitor from the future come back to intercept his own past. He sits here, years too late, knowing everything” (251). The music motivates consciousness and generates thought in its relation to its hearers, and participates in the flexible, various spatio-temporal movements of consciousness, but does not itself determine what that thought or state of consciousness should be.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Given the beginnings of the coffee house in the late seventeenth century as a place for the conversational exchange of ideas amongst an intellectual elite, its demotic version here re-emphasises the necessary embodiment of thinking in serendipitous communicational exchanges and the singularity of each person, enveloped by their mindlife which is momentarily breached by some out of the plethora of signs available for conscious attention in the rich totality of that social space. The differences of response, attention, awareness, thought place exactly the fundamental unpredictability of the new as a product of the complex intersection of personal and cultural history in a moment of time and place, the replay of a composition in that ordinary place making it different and providing different opportunities for its meanings to be apprehended in some way. It is in the moment of awareness, as something significant captures mindlife for a moment and generates a motive for thinking something new into existence, that the fundamentals of innovation are to be found.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The moment in the café is a moment in which a text from the semiosphere can touch or move in unpredictable ways through the minds of those present at its performance and attending to it to some degree. Its effects on thought are multiple; what differentiates the account of thinking generated by an aesthetic text in the narrative and the kind of thinking in the humanities which is intended to create formal knowledge from the same encounter is its deliberateness, its duration and its disciplinary context. As I have already noted, while a new humanities have as their scope the totality of texts gathered in the semiosphere, of which aesthetic texts are a subset, the most powerful relation for the work of ta new humanities in knowledge creation is the interpretive relation between a reader and aesthetic texts which are conscious of their fictionality and mediality.</p>
<p class="noindent1">My argument from this point will proceed to identify the exemplary mode and medium of writing which provides the ultimate foundation for the formation of humanistic knowledge, as a truth-generating process complementary to science (a new humanities, science’s currently missing twin in the conventions of Shakespearean comedy). As I have already proposed above, this mode’s defining characteristics are singularity, mediality, and fictionality. It therefore shares in and acknowledges the dominant modalities of twenty-first century media as I have sketched them in <a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Chapter Four</a> while also in its constitution offering a potent critique of those modalities as they have recently evolved by adaptation to the coordinated forces of neoliberalism, privatisation, and corporate globalisation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Since innovation is now precisely related to the creation of knowledge with market value as intellectual property and/or as materialised as new kinds of product, in what sense can art works be said to produce knowledge of any kind, let alone innovative knowledge? My answer, heavily depended on Luhmann’s analysis of the relation between the art work and the art system, is that works of art in themselves do not create knowledge even while employing all kinds of knowledge in their creation. This is a primary reason why modern claims for their economic value and their innovativeness focus on their qualities as a special kind of object in a special kind of market rather than on the way, uniquely different to the technosciences, that they make the discovery of new knowledge possible.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s5.6"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-6"><i>3.2.1 Theorising the Artwork</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">The exemplary object which provides the link between innovation and cultural policy, and my argument for repositioning the humanities as knowledge which matters in the governance and on-going (re)invention of democratic societies is the work of art. For my purposes, the concept of art, and the set of objects which can be classified as artworks, needs to be as inclusive in terms of historical evolution, form, medium and genre as possible. As I have already noted in <a href="11_ST_CHR3.xhtml#ch3">Chapters Three</a> and <a href="12_ST_CHR4.xhtml#ch4">Four</a>, when discussing the art system and communication, Luhmann’s <i>Art as a Social System</i> provides a challenging and extremely helpful way of thinking about the social functions of art and the ways in which these functions change as societies become more complex. My concern at this point is directed towards the origin and distinctive qualities of artworks; the following brief summary will hardly do justice to the scope and implications of Luhmann’s analysis, but I hope that it is accurate to his principal concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Attributes of the artwork which focus Luhmann’s conception of the art system as both postmodern and strikingly distinctive in relation to other social systems are: its singularity as something new, an event; its creation of a fictional reality; its recursive and intertextual qualities as a medium of communication; and its relation to knowledge and meaning.</p>
<h6 class="sec4" id="s5.7">3.2.1.1 Singularity</h6>
<p class="noindent1">The material singularity of the artwork is strikingly affirmed in an analogy and a conception of its origins. As Luhmann (2000a: 42) puts it, “Despite the built-in, local, and context-specific rationality of its decisions, the work of art itself, being neither the sum nor the aggregate of individual features, is not rational – in this respect, it resembles the world.” At every point, the physical existence of the artwork places it in the real world, but as a humanly (personally, socially and historically) made thing founded by making a distinction: “One cannot start from an immediately given nondetermination – an unmarked space, a primordial entropy or chaos, a empty canvas or white sheet of paper – without distinguishing this state from what is being done to it” (55). The artwork comes into existence when a void is marked with signs; a later expression of this concept, “the unmarked space where signs are engraved into the empty stage, the white sheet of paper, or the silence that makes tones resonate” (291), underlines its generality. For an object to be a modern artwork, it must be singular, and the critical attributes of singularity are the “local, and context-specific rationality of its decisions” and an element of newness (303), which derives from a moment of “self-generated difference” which is its origin and which founds its difference from any other object. In claiming the value of innovation, the modern artwork is expressive of, and presents itself in a critical relation to, its cultural time and place.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The motive which initiates the creation of an artwork is necessary but incidental to an account of its coming into being: “The first impulse is never the artist’s ‘own intention’ – in the sense of self-observed mental states – but something one attributes to the artist as intention when observing the work. One cannot reverbalize intention, at least not apart from the information one gathers from observing works of art” (24). An excellent example of this conception is provided by Anselm Kiefer in a discussion of the significance of his work. On the origin of his paintings and sculpture he said, “It begins in the dark after an intense experience, a shock […] At first it is an urge, a pounding. You don’t know what it is, but it compels you to act. At first, it is very vague. It must be vague, otherwise it would just be a visualisation of the shock experience.”<sup><a id="note_7" href="#note7">7</a></sup> This compulsion, in Luhmann’s analysis, initiates “a new series of operations [which] starts from a self-created difference […]. It (somehow) selects one of an infinite number of possible distinctions in order to constrain the work’s further construction” (29). The artwork develops through this process of selecting among all the possible distinctions which come to mind as a consequence of reflecting on and following through the manifold possibilities inherent in the originating motive.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The cognitive capability on which the creation of an artwork depends is termed intuition:</p>
<p class="quote">the thesis of the primacy of perception in consciousness includes imagined perception, that is, the self-induced simulation of perception. In the following, we shall call this type of perception <i>intuition</i> (Anschauung). Intuition is commonly defined by its utilization of such media as space and time. It implies a double move – and this distinguishes perception from intuition – a transcending of what is immediately given in perception toward the <i>constitution of spatial and temporal horizons</i> and an <i>erasure of information concerning its own spatial/temporal location</i>. Only in the form of intuition does art acquire the possibility of constructing imaginary worlds within the life-world while remaining dependent on triggering perceptions (not least, the reading of texts) (7; author’s emphasis).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The artwork thus achieves object status, like the objects of the given world, but as the outcome of a creative act which has its origin in a motive, the implications of which are as unknown to the artist at that originary moment as they are to the reader/viewer at the moment of first perceiving the artwork. Furthermore, the materiality of the work is constituted by its drawing upon the formal and medial resources of art, the source of its “individual features”. In these ways, the artwork is both of and in the real world while constituting another, imaginary world.</p>
<h6 class="sec4" id="s5.8"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-8"><i>3.2.1.2 Fictionality</i></a></h6>
<p class="noindent1">The analogy with given world objects is not (any longer) the result of conceptions of the artwork as imitating or representing the world, and therefore as having a secondary relation to reality. Instead, the modern artwork</p>
<p class="quote">establishes a reality of its own that differs from ordinary reality. And yet, despite the work’s perceptibility, despite its undeniable reality, it simultaneously constitutes another reality, the meaning of which is imaginary or fictional. […] Only when a reality “out there” is distinguished from fictional reality can one observe one side from the perspective of the other. Language and religion both accomplish such a doubling, which allows us to identify the given world <i>as real</i>. Art adds a new twist to this detour, which leads via the imagination away from and back to reality – art realizes itself in the realm of perceptible objects. Any other doubling of reality can be copied into the imaginary reality of the world of art - the doubling of reality and dream, for example, of reality and play, of reality and illusion, even of reality and art (142-143; author’s emphasis).</p>
<p class="noindent1">There is, therefore, a fundamentally different value to be attributed to the role of fiction than that encapsulated in the traditional binary, truth/fiction:</p>
<p class="quote">Only within a differentiated distinction between a real and a fictional, imagined reality can a specific relation to reality emerge, for which art seeks different forms – whether to “imitate” what reality does not show (its essential forms, its Ideas, its divine perfection), to “criticize” reality for what it does not want to admit (its shortcomings, its “class rule,” its commercial orientation), or to affirm reality by showing that its representation succeeds, in fact, succeeds so well that creating the work of art and looking at it is a delight. The concepts imitation/critique/affirmation do not exhaust the possibilities. Another intent might address the observer as an individual and contrive a situation where he faces reality (and ultimately himself) and learns how to observe it in ways he could never learn in real life. One thinks here particularly of the novel. The novel is an imitation that, rather than referring to reality directly, copies one imaginary reality into another such reality (143).</p>
<p class="noindent1">This succinct history of the functions of art through its various forms is given a different, evolutionary perspective when Luhmann argues that art is enabled more completely to fulfil its social function “to the extent that it emancipates itself from externally imposed or outwardly directed purposes (for example, of a religious, political, or pedagogical nature). Whatever is produced ‘artificially’ provokes the question: ‘What’s the point?’” (23). This question does not determine its own answer, but orients the reader/viewer towards opening an enquiry into the possible meanings of a work. The open-endedness of the question, and the creation of a fictional reality which distinguishes artworks from other kinds of objects, support the view that “art tests arrangements that are at once fictional and real in order to show society, from a position within society, that things could be done differently” (313). Such testing is accomplished by making a “detour […] via the imagination” which places the issue of fiction in a relation to another binary pair, actuality and potentiality, invoking the difference of the real from the possible in the context of an orientation of the artwork towards the future. The openness of the artwork is itself a direct consequence of the indeterminacy of its creation and formal evolution, and this becomes a most important characteristic in modernity: “Art exemplifies a situation in which the future, no longer guaranteed by the past, has become unpredictable” (309). Artworks can draw their material from anywhere in the past of art in the process of condensing potentiality into form and composing a fictional reality. Luhmann insists that the function of fiction is intimately concerned with understanding reality: “Fictionality still presupposes the possibility of discovering what the world is really like, so that fiction can offer a fitting description” (290). In this sense, like the artwork, reality is emergent by means of the differences art offers to perception and the formation of meaning. As he observes in another context, in modernity “the world” becomes reconceived as an “unreachable horizon that retreats further with each operation, without ever holding out the prospect of an outside” (92), a condition exemplified by the artwork which achieves in its formal closure a “unique, circular accumulation of meaning” (120) and yet cannot foreclose on its interpretation.</p>
<h6 class="sec4" id="s5.9"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-9"><i>3.2.1.3 Mediality and Communication</i></a></h6>
<p class="noindent1">The distinctive point of origin for an artwork is a self-created difference, a mark which generates “the difference between ‘marked’ and ‘unmarked’ space” (29) -which is also the difference between the semiosphere and the given world - and the experience of being “plunged into the open, undetermined space of a medium’s possibilities” (153). A critical aspect of the materiality or thingness of the artwork is the medium which materialises the marked space brought into existence by the artist’s motive and the forms of the marks employed as the work develops. It is striking that Luhmann does not, in his extended analysis of the medium/form distinction as it applies to woks of art, refer to the now conventional twentieth century media technologies. Instead, his examples of media include light, sound, language, writing, paint, a theatre stage, a sheet of paper, stone, metal, the human body, space and time; his examples of forms include words, utterances, narratives, genres, theories, truths, postures and movements of the human body in theatre and dance, tones and styles.<sup><a id="note_8" href="#note8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">He argues that the medium/form distinction is of particular significance in understanding the nature of art because it identifies the two most general components of an artwork and their integral relation to one another, so integral that “the medium can be observed only via forms, never as such” (106). A medium shapes what can be done with it; a form generated in a medium can enlarge the possibilities inherent in that medium. The interactivity of medium and form in the work of the artist is generative of the work, not by rule but by the mutual stimulus of motive, medium and form as the work evolves in imaginative time and space (113). A fine example is Powers’ evocation in <i>Orfeo</i> of Messiaen’s writing his <i>Quartet for the End of Time</i>: “Messiaen […] slips back into the spell of patterned sounds. He needs nothing else – only notes, added pitch by pitch towards some obscure whole. As summer dies and fall follows it into extinction, something begins to fill the empty pages: a quartet from beyond all seasons” (110-111). This composing together of medium and form is the source of the artwork’s newness, its unpredictability, and its difference from given world objects to which it is otherwise aligned as a real thing in the world: “art is neither a sign for something else nor the mere form of the material” (120). Instead, “The work of art is an ostentatiously improbable occurrence” (153), one outcome among many possible outcomes of the generative relation between form and medium.</p>
<p class="noindent1">What I am calling mediality is a critically differentiating feature between given world objects and artworks, and brings into the foreground the play of signs as differences, not as referents, in the constitution of the work. Luhmann encapsulates these characterisitics in a discussion of medium as form: “a medium – the material of which the artwork is crafted, the light it breaks, or the whiteness of the paper from which figures or letters emerge – can be used as form, provided that this form succeeds in fulfilling a differentiating function in the work. In contrast to natural objects, an artwork’s material participates in the formal play of the work and is thereby acknowledged as form. The material is allowed to appear as material; it does not merely resist the imprint of form. Whatever serves as medium becomes form once it makes a difference, once it gains an informational value owing exclusively to the work of art” (109). In these ways, the medium/form distinction serves to highlight the challenge offered by the work as a semiotic object uniquely positioned in real time and space, that is, the challenge to render it intelligible in the social medium of meaning, to decipher it (126). Luhmann affirms that “the art system is a special system of social communication” (128).</p>
<h6 class="sec4" id="s5.10"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-10"><i>3.2.1.4 Meaning and Knowledge</i></a></h6>
<p class="noindent1">In its composition and reception, then, the artwork is emergent for both the artist and the reader: it constitutes “an eventlike process that can realize itself only in time. […] With respect to the operativity of its observation, the artwork must be a temporally abstracted structure. It is a program for repeated usage which – like today’s complex computer programs – blocks access to what is actually going on during the execution of the operation. To put it differently, the artwork itself offers no clue as to what happens in the process of understanding the work” (43-44). Instead, what matters is what the artwork as a medium of communication makes it possible for both its creator and its readers/viewers to perceive and understand, which is not any one determined meaning because of the connotative character of the marks employed to create the work and “the diffuse heterogeneity of observer perspectives” (49). As in any other communication, “Communication occurs whenever the utterance of an information is understood – which may result in acceptance or rejection, consensus or dissent. Moreover, communication through art is not concerned with automating understanding. Rather, it is inherently ambiguous” (39). The common resource is the medium of meaning, which Luhmann decribes as the “most general medium that makes both psychic and social systems possible and is essential to their functioning” (107). Meaning is a semantic formation “constituted by the distinction between actuality and potentiality (or between the real as momentarily given and as possibility)” (107), a distinction which occurs “at the heart of experience and communication” (139) and which I have previously discussed in the form of the speculative question, “what if?”. Meaning, unlike formal knowledge, is “bound to a certain point in time […] As a self-reproducing (autopoietic) process, meaning must always begin with the actual, a historically given situation” (107-8) but move into the contingent realm of the possible. A particular function of art in the production of meaning derives from its creation of fictional realities through which possibilities are actualised, with the effect that “Art radicalizes the difference between the real and the merely possible in order to show through works of its own that even in the realm of possibility there is order after all” (145). Not just one order, but a variety of possible orders discovered in the process of creating artworks and the production of new meaning based on them: “art projects a society as yet unable to experience and describe itself adequately” (145).</p>
<p class="noindent1">By grounding his conception of the artwork in the primacy of perception in human cognition, Luhmann does not claim that the artwork is itself knowledge. He observes that, “While thought is highly aware of its obligation toward intersubjective agreement […] perceptions are intersubjectively different and always new” (39). What it may contribute to knowledge is a function of its reception and interpretation, the work of understanding performed by a reader or viewer and which is exposed to others by being verbalised. The artwork “distinguishes itself from verbal communication in that it operates in the medium of perception or intuition without drawing on the specific potential of language to produce meaning” (25). This does not mean that artworks are only composed of (combinations of) visual, auditory, and tactile components, whether static or in motion. Of poetry he writes that “A poem’s ‘message’ does not allow for paraphrase, nor can it be summarized in a proposition that can be true or false. Rather, connotations, not denotations, mediate its meaning. […] words are used as a <i>medium,</i> rather than for the purpose of expressing an unambiguous denotative meaning” (25). A general characteristic of artworks is the reversal of normal expectations about efficiency in communication: “art aims to <i>retard</i> perception and render it <i>reflexive</i> – lingering on the object in visual art (in striking contrast to everyday perception) and slowing down reading in literature” (14). Furthermore, “deliberate indeterminacies play a significant role, particularly in artistically mediated consciousness to the point where we find ourselves confronted by the hopelessly unending interpretability of ‘finished’ works” (11-12).</p>
<p class="noindent1">In modernity and postmodernity, the key constituents of the artwork are its difference initiated by a motive, its use of the polysemous capabilities of signs, forms and media (that is, its use of the resources of the semiosphere, including its intertextuality and multimediality) to create a singular and new fictional reality, and its intent to communicate. Its primary function is to impel the discovery of more of reality by exploring what is possible by “extend[ing] the realm of communication beyond what can be put into words” (18). Nonetheless, neither this intent nor this function can be accomplished except by a return to language: “Art can only exist when there is language – this is less trivial than it sounds. […] the artwork […] only comes into being by virtue of recursive networking with other works of art, with widely distributed verbal communications about art, with technically reproducible copies, exhibitions, museums, theatres, buildings, and so forth. […] One turns to the medium of language while retaining art and its works as a topic” (22, 53). Luhmann’s book is a perfect exemplar of the way in which artworks are generative of knowledge not limited to art itself but extensive to reality as it is and might be. The contribution of the artwork to knowledge is indirect and unpredictable because it occurs through the agency of the reader/viewer: “In creating a double of reality from which reality can be observed, the artwork can leave it to the observer to overcome this split – whether in an idealizing, critical, or affirmative manner, or by […] discovering and realizing various possibilities of order on the basis of an increasing freedom and a growing distance vis-a-vis an established reality” (143-144).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Faced with the historical evolution of diverse forms of art, and especially the difference between literary works and those composed in non-linguistic media, Luhmann raises the question whether a unified theory of artistic kinds is possible. His answer is in the affirmative, grounded in an analysis which is very important for my argument about the need to bring cultural policy into the foreground of public policy thinking. As he points out, “Even today, the notion of a unified art system meets with sceptical resistance, mainly because of manifest differences among the arts, especially when it comes to the question of whether or not literature ought to be considered a part of the art system” (179). My exposition of Luhmann’s theory of the artwork is altogether aimed towards identifying a uniquely significant social function for artworks in all media in the formation of new meaning and knowledge, however the process of that formation is culturally and historically influenced. Luhmann argues that “What presents itself to observation in the form of art is an independent contribution to communication that cannot be translated into any other medium. […] What is at stake is not a problem to be solved once and for all but a provocation – the provocation of a search for meaning that is constrained by the work of art without necessarily being determined in its results” (24). This emphasis upon the artwork as a medium of communication for the formation of new meaning, a work possessing formal order but open to multiple interpretations, is encapsulated in a single sentence definition of the medium of art: “This medium is the improbability of the combinatory structure of form that art wrests from everyday life and that refers the observer to other observers” (128). The communicational circuit instantiated by the artwork constitutes a social relation among its community of readers/viewers which is productive of knowledge; it is in <u>their</u> work of verbalising to one another the perceptions generated by the artwork that society becomes able more fully to comprehend itself and to begin to comprehend the forms of its possible futures.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s5.11"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-11">3.3 Discovery by Art</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">For Luhmann, in the theory and social function of the arts “the real issue (as postclassical music and painting demonstrate) is the general problem of fictionality, the exclusive rule of art over the difference between reality and fictionality” (179). His analysis identifies, as I am attempting to do, how fictionality is fundamental to understanding the evolution of postmodern societies, and how re-thinking the existence of artworks and their ability “to discover onward things more remote from our knowledge” should impel a profound shift in current ways of thinking about the origins of new knowledge. I have referred now three times in this discussion to Richard Powers’ novel, <i>Orfeo</i>, because it provides a brilliant exemplification of Luhmann’s analysis of the cultural and social functions of the novel as a genre and of his reference to music as evidence of his argument for the core function of fictionality. Pertinent here is the composer Peter Els’s recollection of his first major composition, a setting of the concluding lines of Whitman’s “Song of Myself” which marked his shift at university from chemistry to music:</p>
<p class="quote">He studies the words for days, listening to the sounds contained in them. Then the phonemes and accents led him forward. Note by note, phrase by phrase, he relived that picnic in the snow: the sun low in the sky through the bones of an oak, promising some hidden continuance, and that shivering girl holding a thermos in her mittened cellist’s fingers, challenging him with a few chanted and expanding words […] Each measure he wrote changed the ones he’d already written, and he felt them all, already being altered by the unformed noises of the years to come. […] He stole from Mahler, to be sure: the blurred boundary between major and minor. The shaky key regions that wheeled off, before the end, into wildness. A spinning waltz, a distant brass band. Slow ascent tumbling down in a heartbeat, only to climb again in a reprieve of the next measure. All the individual components had a familiar air. But the thing as a whole never quite existed before Peter wrote it down (61-63).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Motive, medium, form, the past of music providing materials for something new in music drawn from the realms of experience and the possible and made actual in performance, whether imagined by reading the score or by hearing the work performed. Powers does not offer an interpretation of the work, and Els makes no claims for its meaning. But the imaginative space which it creates takes its composer and its listeners into a fictional reality from within which what Luhmann calls “established reality” (144) can be reflected upon. What might be discovered as knowledge from this shift of position is the articulate work of reader/viewers, whatever knowledge base they might individually bring to their experience of the work.</p>
<p class="noindent1">My overall argument proposes that the work of discovery initiated by an artwork is carried on by anyone who reflects on their experience of artworks and endeavours to communicate those reflections to others in the vast networks constituting postmodern society. But there is also an expert dimension to this thoughtful work. Here, too, is the reason why it is the artwork which most completely opens the way to the creation of knowledge in a new humanities. Luhmann notes that “When art is considered to be a sign, thinking of art in terms of its uniqueness becomes an option, and when art is understood to be a form combination, uniqueness becomes an imperative – enforced by the mode of production and by the requirements of understanding” (168). The formal work of the humanities, textual interpretation, is most fully exemplified when the meanings generated by the “open-ended multiplicity of possible connections” (104) among the signs, forms and media composing an artwork are verbalised with the intent of making the discoveries of artists available to thought and knowledge. The move to fiction allows form to be given to what is possible and the meanings of that form to be engaged in the critical and reflexive work of thinking society towards its better futures.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s5.12"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-12">4. Poetics</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Aesthetic texts are always already fully within culture. They reflect humanity and our knowledge of the world back to ourselves in ways impossible to science. They draw from collective knowledge, using the sign repertoires of language, image and sound as these have been culturally elaborated throughout human time, and from our inherent capability to reflect on ourselves and our circumstances hypothetically, speculatively. They take us mentally out of ourselves in order to bring us back, but somewhere else.</p>
<p class="noindent1">By employing any combination of elements from the range of available sign systems and media modalities, they can challenge not only conventional forms of imagination but also the established rules (the grammars) for combining these elements into forms productive of knowledge. For Bernstein (2011: 73), “In contrast to the syllogistic rationality of expository writing, poetics is situational, shifts with the winds, courts contradiction, feeds on inconsistency.” Aesthetic texts adopt fictionality as a mode of cognition, and address society (and the given world through society) in political terms, that is, terms which compose facts and values together.<sup><a id="note_9" href="#note9">9</a></sup> Poetics is a general term for the theory of the composition of texts, which are produced from the matter of other texts and the semiotic and media systems available to a society and are designed to involve or shape a reader’s emotional and imaginative as well as cognitive engagement. It is thus a theory of, or rules for, a certain kind of communication between human beings.<sup><a id="note_10" href="#note10">10</a></sup> Although it would be normal to exclude scientific texts from poetics, regarding that as proper to the creative arts, such an exclusion is as inappropriate from the perspective of a new humanities as is the view that science is culturally neutral. A poetics of scientific texts, for example, would include prescriptions for objectivity, denotative language, realistic images, diagrams and tables, mathematical expressions, exclusion of metaphor, the use of the passive voice. Descriptive terms like clear, lucid, transparent, rational, and methodical would identify an aesthetics of controlled emotion and disciplined subjectivity; a medium (print book, film, TV programme, web page etc) would be employed in such a way that the object of the scientific enquiry would be made present to the reader as such and as though the singular person of the researcher was as dissociated from the research results as are the technologies employed in the research and in its communication. Similar descriptive terms and most of the prescriptions outlined above would apply in a poetics of the modern (but not postmodern) humanities, as they adapted discursively to the conceptions of scholarly communication defining scientific method, discourse and publication conventions, and the poetics of print media news reporting.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A fine example of the difference between referring and signifying is offered by Gass using the example of a statue, the most physically real of aesthetic texts. The statue is like a world in the void of space, a text in the void of the semiosphere considered as the invisible but real dimension of the real world opened up by human thought, rather than a person in the richness of their local space-time context:</p>
<p class="quote">On the other side of a novel lies the void. Think for instance, of a striding statue; imagine the purposeful inclination of the torso, the alert and penetrating gaze of the head and its eyes, the outstretched arm and pointing finger; everything would appear to direct us toward some goal in front of it. Yet your eye travels only to the finger’s end, and not beyond. Though pointing, the finger bids us stay instead, and we journey slowly back along the tension of the arm. In our hearts we know what actually surrounds the statue. The same surrounds every work of art: empty space and silence (1970: 49).</p>
<p class="noindent1">By invoking the sign repertoire (or cultural inventory) of a viewer, the sculpture brings into play cultural values and meanings which are given real presence by being embodied in action.<sup><a id="note_11" href="#note11">11</a></sup> Furthermore, none of the values – purposeful, alert, penetrating – are “in the real”, and their meanings are not necessarily only or universally good. All it takes for the statue to be identified as a representation of a tyrant, and the statue will communicate (to someone subject to or aware of tyranny) threat, control and surveillance. Gass’s context for the statue of the void (instanced physically as a gallery or other display space distinct from everyday social space) does not so much argue for the dissociation of the aesthetic object from reality as for its locating in the physical real the existence of that which is otherwise hidden and invisible, the cultural systems of value and meaning which constitute and structure social and political reality.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Just as the possibilities of art have changed with the invention of new media technologies as one component of massive social and cultural changes over the past two hundred years (for example, Benjamin (1970) and Nichols’ (2000) reframing of Benjamin’s analysis), so the meaning of the term poetics (like the term writing) has widened to embrace the kinds of texts distinctive to these media, however much they share features with earlier forms (for example, narrative fiction in print, the novel, and in the theatre (especially in the form of the opera) becomes the movie, the television series, and now electronic literature), as it has also widened to include the new disciplines formed by the study of the textual products of these media technologies.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Is there a kind of textual object which, more than any other, opens the possibility of innovation and the discovery of new (that is, transformative) knowledge by the humanities complementary to science and of the same fundamental value to human social evolution? I have already argued that the boundaries (or horizons!) of the academic humanities have had to expand in order to bring these new media within the scope of the intellectual work of the university; what I want to develop here is the claim that the most exemplary form of the aesthetic text remains the poem. The poem’s exemplarity consists (in so far as it does) to the extent that it persists as a linguistic artefact, whatever the surface on which it is inscribed and however any specific media technology contributes to the effects of the poem, which are both cognitive and affective, constituting a mental event which can be productive of other events in other times and places, and knowledge in the I-space. It is there, in the interactive environment of minds, institutions, politics, cultures, histories and texts, that new humanistic knowledge is formulated and expounded, and the most complex form initiating this humanistic knowledge work is the poem.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s5.13"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-13">4.1 Poetics and the Poem</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">I have argued to this point that, within the accumulated contents of the semiosphere, there are many different kinds of texts which can be grouped in various ways according to distinguishing features, for example, mediality (whether a text suppresses or reflexively engages with its medium), fictionality (whether a text erases from or embeds in its work the imaginative, affective and moral formation of the singular mind which has thought and written it into existence), and rhetoricity (the academic discourse conventions which signal a particular positioning in expert intellectual work, and all the other generic conventions governing the social production and reception of discourse). If the humanities discipline which could position itself most closely to the sciences and the dominant communication medium of print in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was history, then I would argue that a new humanities, occasioned in principle by humanity’s entry to postmodernity from the mid-twentieth century, is to be derived from locating the theory and practice of mediality/textuality at its heart. Because “media studies” is a narrower term of reference typically applied to mass media, and because the advent of networked digital ICTs has dramatically diversified the opportunities for text creation, a theoretical foundation is needed which embraces all media and all kinds of text (the contents of the semiosphere, not ranked according to any criterion of value). If bibliography is the name for the theory and practice of mediality/textuality in the era of print, a new name is needed. Since I have argued in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a> for expanding the meaning of “text” to refer to any object in any medium using any system of inscription, and terms like textography and mediography already have established uses, “text studies” will have to do as a placeholder. Textonomy (Aarseth 1997) is an attractive possibility, but the scope of the term text is limited.<sup><a id="note_12" href="#note12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Within text studies there are many subsets, reflecting the evolutionary history of media technologies, sign systems, contexts of creation and modes of publication, and discipline formation in the humanities. But the subset I wish to focus on, and break down further, is distinguished by singularity of authorship, reflexivity in respect of its medium, and a capacity to displace a reader’s/viewer’s/hearer’s normalised world construction with another imagined and possible world. I would call this literature, if “literature” were to be understood as the writing out, and the reinventing through fiction and interpretation or critique, of culture and subjectivity in their most complex and subtle dimensions, in any medium of representation in which, however skilful the scenic values and other aspects of world construction, it is language which permits us to locate and express most fully the meanings of what we are shown and told. By means of such texts a writer or reader engages with culture as such, and in its relations with the material world; that is, literature engages with humanity as such, as the collective producer of the diversities of knowledge, meaning and value which is the truly distinctive contribution humans make as a part of the ecology of the Earth. But the term literature has remained fixed by the media used originally in the formation of its texts, namely, written language and print, and the institutionalising of the texts of the print medium as the true type of formal knowledge (so that “literature” does not just mean texts written with a high degree of consciousness of form, genre and linguistic style, or narrative fictional texts, but published knowledge in any academic or professional field). So, for example, to refer to literary texts created in hypertextual or other digital formats, it is currently usual to refer to e-literature or hypertext fiction; and other narrative fictions are distinguished by the medium in which they are instantiated (theatre, opera, film, TV series, videogame<sup><a id="note_13" href="#note13">13</a></sup>). Furthermore, the proponents of virtual reality conceptions of new media, by emphasising the value of media as their capacity to achieve the audiovisual effect of perceived physical reality, disguise the designs which all media forms have on their readers and which are implemented rhetorically and mentally.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Nonetheless, all of the texts in the subset covered by the term literature as I have extended its scope perform to varying degrees a function crucial to innovation; they create the possibility of some kind of transformation of the real by stimulating (and simulating) transformations in thinking, by placing their readers in a suspended relation to the real occasioned by the human ability to formulate speculative scenarios of the kind “what if?” or “not yet”. But there is a further reduction I wish to make, to bring the work of transformation as close as possible to thought as such, which I take to be represented most fully by written language using abstract notation systems – alphanumeric, ideographic, musical - and formal grammatical, syntactical and generic rules of combination. Even here there is a further distinction to make, based on the singularity of the personal origin of thought and a reflexive relation to the conventions governing the use of sign systems for the communication of thought. The kind of text capable of possessing all of these characteristics is the poem, and I will seek to show how, in our time, it is the poem which provides the most complex and articulated opening to the formulation of innovative knowledge by the methods of a new humanities, “new” because to take the poem as the exemplary instance of the artwork as a source of new knowledge challenges the double value associated in the modern humanities as well as the sciences with the real and the objective as guarantors of truth in the processes of knowledge formation and validation.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s5.14"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-14"><i>4.1.1 An origin</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">Proposing to build the case for the importance of knowledge creation by a new humanities on poetry will undoubtedly seem incredible, including to many in the academic humanities. But I believe (while granting a bias inherent to my own context of English literary studies) that it is only by pressing as far as possible towards what locates the ground of claims that the humanities have and can create knowledge of enduring value and innovative effect that a conception of the humanities to-come possessing equality with the claims for techno-science in its diverse disciplinary expressions can be formulated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">An opening which brings ancient traditions of thought to bear on the present can be found in the reflections of an Indian novelist and programmer, Vikram Chandra, who exemplifies his proposition that “The world is a web, a net, as is each human being nested within the world, holding other worlds within” (2013: 166). These worlds for Chandra include Indian literature and literary theory, British colonial culture, modern and postmodern Western literature, and a “contemporary American culture of programming” (61). As a result of attending a reading in New York by Indian poets on tour he began to explore the traditions of Indian literary theory; this dimension of his cultural inheritance provided the way to a different understanding of the relations between the two kinds of writing, particularly how far an analogy between programming and literature can be taken. Chandra quotes from the Rig Veda: “Language cuts forms in the ocean of reality” (167), which points to a problem at the heart of his discussion investigated by ninth century CE theorists: “how the effects of language can escape language itself” (221). In respect of poetry, this question impels an enquiry into “how poetry moves across the borders of bodies and selves, and […] how consciousness uses and is reconstructed by poetry, how poetry expands within the self and allows access to the unfathomably vast, to that which cannot be spoken.” For programming, he argues that emphasising traditional literary qualities like elegance “says nothing about the ability of code to materialize logic. […] Code is uniquely kinetic. It acts and interacts with itself, with the world. In code, the mental and the material are one. Code moves. It changes the world” (221). The common factor, then, linking the writing of code with the writing of fiction is that both “are explorations of process, of the unfolding of connections” (239). They make the as yet unknown available to knowledge, giving culturally inflected forms to what is emergent in our human attempts to understand and modify the world in which we live. Chandra’s book is a striking exemplification of humanistic thought in practice.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In a move determined by my own literacy and characteristic of humanistic method, I intend to recover a text which engaged the same problematic over 400 years ago, Sir Philip Sidney’s <i>An Apology for Poetry</i> (1595), and then to link its arguments with those of Alain Badiou, a philosopher in the Platonic tradition with which Sidney aligns himself. A deep continuity can be observed between our present and the founding of the modern period in Europe, notably the transition from Christian to secular humanism and its complex interactions with the development of modern science, the new dynamic represented by the social and economic roles of the city and its communication systems, and the evolution of the democratic nation state. The status of the humanities, like that of poetry, has declined dramatically during this period, especially in relation to government and the state. The claims made for them by their practitioners (however fundamental in respect of a conception of the knowledges required for the state and society to function effectively, and of their capacity to create new knowledge of value to society and the economy) have clearly had negligible effect, notably in the past 50 years and especially in the context of the knowledge politics systematically pursued by the proponents of neoliberalism.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Because the informing context for these matters is so large, historically, politically and culturally, it is worth returning to a kind of beginning comparable to that which I have signalled by taking my chapter epigraphs from Milton. A fine instance of what I have called deep continuity is to be found in Sidney’s <i>Apology</i>, the first elaborated theory of poetry in English, written at the very beginnings of the modern period and the first steps in the expansion of the British empire, in which the very issues of cultural disempowerment with which modern and postmodern humanities struggle were explored in relation to the nature and cultural standing of poetry. It is also a defence of the possibility of an English literature (that is, not Literature, but the distinctive forms of that textual category which are made possible by the English language and its cultural settings), and his text is regarded as marking the beginnings of literary criticism in English.</p>
<p class="noindent1">At the foundations of the modern western order of culture, society and knowledge we can observe through Sidney’s text the articulation of a structure of relations which has been progressively entrenched by scientific and technological development and its commercial extension. Sidney noted the forces involved in terms of relations to knowledge and the role of information and communications media, in a way which was prescient not only because his argument failed in both the short and long term, but because the terms of his argument remain to be re-asserted in our present, now that the environmental and social consequences of the dominance of technocratic values and modes of thinking have become glaringly apparent.<sup><a id="note_14" href="#note14">14</a></sup> By making his text present to us again, we can perceive what has become marginal in the official account postmodern science-based societies give of themselves, and why public thinking and policy should become open (again) to knowledge formulated by a new humanities from its most original source in the poem.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The theory of poetry advanced by Sidney aims at the total reversal of what he notes is the situation of “poor Poetry, which from almost the highest estimation of learning is fallen to be the laughing-stock of children” (1973: 96). Accomplishing this intention requires him to place poetry in the context of the other powerful modes of knowledge of his time, including religious knowledge. His argument clearly foreshadows the empirical, technocratic and pragmatic principles, conceptions and values on which modern western societies are now based, in research, government and economy. Specifically of the English, he writes that “Our nation hath set their hearts’ delight upon action, and not upon imagination, rather doing things worthy to be written, than writing things fit to be done” (126). It also foregrounds the contest which persists in the academic humanities between literary, historical and philosophical studies, and offers a reason – in the derivation of the object of their knowledge work in the given world – why the latter two have been able to align themselves with the sciences and social sciences as these have evolved through the modern period, whereas literary studies (except, for example, in bibliography and literary history) have not. He observes that “There is no art delivered to mankind that hath not the works of Nature for his principal object, without which they could not consist, and on which they so depend, as they become actors and players, as it were, of what Nature will have set forth” (99-100). This is not an argument against, for example, the knowledge work of natural philosophers, or historians, or lawyers as such, or their accurate performance of the script nature presents them with (Sidney writes of Italian as aspiring to be a “treasure-house of science” (96), as his aspiration is for English), but it is an argument against its limitations, which are the limitations or “narrow warrant” of nature itself. This knowledge when true is intended to “tell you what is and is not” (124), which today is one foundation of the claim for the absolute priority of scientific over other modes of knowledge formation. But for Sidney, in a characterisation which is startling because it so completely runs against current conventions, the natural sciences (including history and philosophy) are but “serving sciences” (104), means to a larger end which they cannot accomplish by themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent1">All of the knowledge Sidney is considering shares a common quality: it is expressed linguistically, and in writing. So, at the heart of his argument lies a conception of writing and authorship which is capable of being a means for generating true knowledge by transcending the limits imposed on the creators of all other kinds of knowledge by the requirement of fidelity to the real (Nature), and by what we would now call disciplinary knowledge, in which the creators of new knowledge are limited by the protocols and boundaries of a discipline field; as he puts it, they are “wrapped within the fold of the proposed subject” (102). The uniquely different kind of author is a special kind of poet, conceived of as a radical source of transformative knowledge in contrast to those poets claiming authority because their writing is grounded in religious, philosophical or historical knowledge. Two classical terms, prophet and maker, capture the defining qualities of this poet’s creative knowledge work, which are summarised in two descriptions: the poet “borrow[s] nothing of what is, hath been, or shall be; but range[s], only reined with learned discretion, into the divine consideration of what may be and should be” (102), and, “disdaining […] subjection [to Nature], lifted up with the vigour of his own invention, doth grow in effect into another nature, making things either better than Nature bringeth forth, or, quite anew” (100). Poets are “makers of themselves, not takers of others” (131); “whereas other arts retain themselves within their subjects, and receive, as it were, their being from it, the poet only bringeth his own stuff, and doth not learn a conceit out of a matter, but maketh matter for a conceit” (120). Sidney is assisted in developing his conception of the poet by the Christian conception of God as maker and its consequence, that we are capable of knowing “what perfection is” (101). The object of representation is “the <i>Idea</i> or fore-conceit of the work” (101), which the poet discovers by “freely ranging only within the zodiac of his own wit” (100), governed by “no law but wit” (102).</p>
<p class="noindent1">This radical claim for the superiority of knowledge created poetically by a singular mind crossing the boundaries between the actual and the possible, generating new concepts by generating from the singular resources of that mind the intellectual matter from which they can be drawn, is of profound significance as a corrective to the now exclusive claims of scientific method to be the only valid source of new knowledge. Against such claims it proposes a singular origin for new knowledge in one resourceful mind exploring in thought and language beyond the limits to the collective knowledge work of those bound to Nature or the real, which is part of the resource available to the poet. This is not to privilege individualism or subjectivity over collective interests, so that the experience, sensations and perceptions of the poet are affirmed and expressed in a private and subjective space protected against the powers of the state, society and its institutions. Critical to this conception is the freedom to innovate (Sidney’s term is “invention”) given by following where the mind leads, and especially into the domain of what can be imagined as possible futures and moral transformations because of what thought can do and language can express. Its difference lies in the conception of humanity as not only part of nature, but also as its supplement, and it is in this kind of poetry that distinctive attributes and capacities of humanity are most fully realised.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The humanistic context which so fully informs Sidney’s thinking is integral to the specific conception of the work of poetry and the poet as he formulates it, but it is a context which postmodern western societies need urgently to recover. Just as the singularity of the poet’s exercise of thought is a necessary condition for creating knowledge of value, so the immediate use of that knowledge is singular, in the enhancing of “the knowledge of a man’s self, in the ethic and politic consideration, with the end of well-doing and not well-knowing only” (104). Social action on the basis of this knowledge is as much a test of the quality of the person deriving knowledge from the poem, as the idea and its expression by the poem is a test of the quality of the poet’s mind. Not surprisingly, the human activity for which knowledge creation (and specifically poetry) is most important is education. As Sidney writes, “this purifying of wit, this enriching of memory, enabling of judgment, and enlarging of conceit, which commonly we call learning” (104) connects the individual to social betterment through “virtuous action” (104), “justice being the chief of virtues” (106). How reductive the present emphasis on education for economic development is in comparison to this humanistic conception of the person acting knowledgably, morally and politically in the interests of achieving a more just society, that is, a society capable of achieving more of what we can know and imagine of what it means to be human in the given world.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sidney’s conception of the ideal type of the poem and poet brings together a theory of knowledge and cognition and the linguistic and aesthetic forms which have evolved to express the work of the mind. He leaves the discovery of new knowledge of the real (Nature) to those whose work it is, drawing upon it but without conceding authority to it; instead, it is the poet who has “all, from Dante’s heaven to his hell, under the authority of his pen” (111). As a resource for the work of the poet, existing knowledge is transformed in two ways, one linking imagination and fiction, the other the skilful use of artistically composed language to shape a reader’s reception of a poem. Both focus on affecting the mind by using media forms to open a mental space in which mental events can set up a critical relation to real world events. The space constituted by poem is the space of “what if?”, the space in which “what may be and should be” can be explored, the space in which our humanity as the cultural supplement expanding the real can be engaged, and it is opened by employing the cognitive instruments of language and image.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The irony of the position as it is stated here is that what Sidney regards as “serving sciences”, bound to the real, now claim to have fully occupied this mental space, and that the knowledges they represent signify the supplement that humanity brings to nature. The crucial difference lies in the term fiction and its now entrenched cultural significance as, firstly, entertainment (which is where it achieves some recognition in economic and cultural policy), and secondly, as a mode of representation incapable of producing knowledge with evidential or probative value. In one respect, this characterisation of fiction is now based on a profound misrecognition; as I have already noted, science and technology as a knowledge project with material outcomes has in many of its domains adopted “what may be and should be” as the informing principle of research and its application. In other words, fiction as the term for thinking about what could become real is integral to post-industrial societies and their economies. But Sidney also imposed a crucial qualification on such fictions; if they exclude consideration of the moral implications of what they imagine and bring into existence, then the outcomes of the mental work done to think them into existence are fundamentally defective. He also answered the objection that the imagination is not a means to valid knowledge when he offered the test which is also in a different way offered by science and technology. Knowledge created by formulating and communicating thought fictionally is to be validated by observable practice. The poet does not “build castles in the air” (101); the imagined world of the poem is not an end in itself but can effect actual change in the real world.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As I have noted already, Sidney’s theory of the effective transmission and application of knowledge worth having is educational; his argument that poetry is both the best medium and the best modality for this purpose is based on the view that learning does not occur if it is not desired by the learner, and imitation of ideas through social action cannot occur unless the learner’s mind (and especially memory) is actively engaged. It is not just a matter of passive imitation of a model vividly described, because the realm of the idea and the realm of action are not equivalent. The first stage of learning from the poem is learning “how and why that maker” created the model/idea presented by the poem; it is the second stage where the contingency of time and place imposes a crucial requirement on the reader and a limit on the scope for direct effect of the poem. Sidney advises the reader to “use the narration but as an imaginative ground plot of a profitable invention” (124), which I take to mean that the embodiment in action of the idea formulated by the poem requires each reader, by engaging their knowledge, insight and experience with the idea of the poem, to translate the model/ idea into appropriate but singular action. Enactment of the idea of the poem is both a translation and an interpretation of the informing concept by its readers, involving momentary decisions to act by embodying the idea in specific situations at specific moments in time; the idea is multiplied and modified in the world as many readers seek to incorporate it in social action.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The educative power of the poem lies in its double capability, stimulating the imagining of fictional worlds and encouraging their translation into the real through human action energised and focussed by the poet’s linguistic skill: “if reading be foolish without remembering, memory being the only treasurer of knowledge, those words which are fittest for memory are likewise most convenient for knowledge. […] the words (besides their delight, which hath a great affinity to memory) being so set as one word cannot be lost but the whole work fails” (122). Although a poem for Sidney is a written artefact (123), he typically imagines poetic communication as oral speech using narrative form to construct imaginable working models of ideal or true human thought and social action. Hence his definition of poetry as “an art of imitation […] a representing, counterfeiting, or figuring forth – to speak metaphorically, a speaking picture – with this end, to teach and delight” (101). The poem presents to the “eyes of the mind” (99) subjectively what the new audiovisual media of the past century now present objectified on a screen. In one respect this is but a confirmation and extension of Sidney’s emphasis on a story-telling medium capable of vividly replicating our visual relation to the world. But in another it affirms his view that the medium principally able to accomplish this end is written language (“to speak metaphorically”), the medium of thought and knowledge in its modality of poetry (Opie, 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sidney observes that a poem may traditionally use regular verse forms, relating them to neoclassical conceptions of rational order and the function of number in nature, but they are not essential (121-122). Any medium which is used to accomplish personal and social transformation through the imaginative, subjective, moral and aesthetically affecting exploration of alternative models of human living is in that use functioning poetically. And, since Sidney’s model poem is one which narrates human thought, feeling and action in simulated events designed to provide imitable and attractive models of perfected humanity, his poetics can apply to and be used to discriminate among the productions of the whole panoply of narrative multi-media forms developed since his time, and most specifically in the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A powerful desire manifested in modern media evolution is the achievement of the technological means to render with absolute visual fidelity either the real or the imagined as though it were real, one to which he attested when he praised writing that could represent “virtues, vices, passions so in their own natural seats laid to the view, that we seem not to hear of them, but clearly see through them” (108). The wonder now is the picture, not that it speaks - reversing Eve’s astonishment before the speaking serpent in the Garden of Eden. This displacement of language by the image (another instance of knowledge politics at work) is at the core of the problem of the humanities in the postmodern knowledge economy in that they, in their full disciplinary integrity, only speak, whatever the media modality of the objects they interrogate. The desire for media which can represent the real as we see it is as old as the representational arts, and it is the past century which has evolved those media to their present extraordinary levels of capability – but in a manner typically consistent with the progressivist, scientific framing of knowledge and conceptions of the real which dominated the culture and motivations of that century. The shift from epic poetry to the prose novel and then the cinema as culturally dominant narrative fictional forms is also a shift towards increasing conformity with the conventions of realist representation, a criterion shared with science and history. One of the remarkable aspects of twentieth century media evolution is that Sidney’s definition of poetry applies with uncomfortable pertinence most fully to television advertising, literally speaking pictures employing fictional micro-narratives which aim to inform and sell by modelling desire and invoking values using aesthetic means.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Given that twentieth-century media and their continuing evolution through digital media have fully exploited the power of the medium to shape viewers’ knowledge of themselves and the world they live in, and their behaviour in that world, based on advanced scientific knowledge of the interaction of knowledge, desire, and self-concepts in human action (which nonetheless supports the same understanding of human cognition that Sidney made the basis of his poetics), the difference lies in the purposes and ends of this use of media power. For Sidney, it is the coming into being of a just and humane society, grounded in individual knowledge of what could be and given collective form by means of individually motivated decisions and actions in a specific time and place. He would understand, because he understood the effects of “infected will” and material self-interest, why such a potent force and integral capability in human societies could be perverted from that aim, to serve the exploitative interests and will to control of powerful people and organisations.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The poetic power of the medium must be married to a singular mind possessed by the highest conceptions of human capability for its power to produce the kinds of learning which Sidney understands to be critical in social evolution and which has the fullest achievement of human potentials in society and nature as its goal. He would surely grant the title poet to at least some of the writers of science fiction, those like Philip K. Dick or Iain M. Banks or William Gibson who employ current knowledge in the creation of fictions providing their readers with the means to think humanely forward and so contribute to shaping what may be and should be in the future worlds resulting from human thought and action, and especially in that world uniquely brought into existence by human social action, the world of the city. If any postmodern actuality confirms Sidney’s conception of the profound chasm between humanity’s “erected wit […] and infected will” (101) and the work needed to bridge it, it must be the global city.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Science and media technologies have shifted the boundaries between kinds of knowledge and their distinguishing characteristics as Sidney could know them. The creation of that which has never existed in nature now defines the goal of science and technology, for example, in genetic engineering, space exploration, and digital information and communications technologies. But Sidney’s fundamental contrast between poetry and the other professional domains of knowledge creation remains entirely relevant today. Throughout his essay, he holds fast to the criterion of personal moral quality as an integral component of knowledge work, locating the ultimate purpose of that work not in the end of knowledge for its own sake, of for power or wealth, but in the betterment of human society through the moral, intellectual and consequent civil betterment of humanity. If his assumption of universal moral values derived from European classical and Christian traditions has been displaced by conceptions of cultural difference and human rights, his humanistic anchoring of his discussion of the value and purpose of knowledge to the improvement of the quality of human living in social relations remains of critical importance to any consideration of the claims to be made for the humanities as knowledge of value.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As Sidney recognised, the problematic difference separating modern humanities disciplines, and the humanities from the sciences, has its origin in the fictionality and singularity of the objects of literary/media study and the refusal in the modern university or by government to admit evidence from the analysis of fictional objects as having probative value. Sidney’s humanistic argument challenges the current conception of society and its knowledge system created by the alignment of the techno-sciences, government, business, and the market. His model of poetic innovation emphasises the creation of socially transformative knowledge by the intellectual labour of free minds disseminated through media forms which stimulate imagination and desire for learning in their readers. It places realising the moral, social and intellectual potential of humanity in the foreground and its goal is the institution of the just society brought into being by the just acts of its citizens.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s5.15"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-15"><i>4.1.2 From the Early Modern to the Postmodern</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">Poetry for Sidney, when written with artistic skill by a writer singularly open to perceiving what is true in knowledge, is the most effective means of communicating “the conceits of the mind” through reading to another mind with the end of enhancing self-knowledge and stimulating civilising social action. This humanistic imperative remains fundamental to claims for the value of aesthetic texts in any medium and the textual work of the academic humanities, even while conceptions of the relations between the artist, the artwork and knowledge, and the purposes of academic research, have changed through the modern period.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I wish to contextualise Sidney’s defence of poetry in a way which will demonstrate these continuities while also taking into account the shifting relationship between poetry and knowledge in postmodernity. In order to do this, I will firstly draw upon two books about poetry written by Arthur Cook and Charles Bernstein; taken together they provide perspectives which allow me to extend the core principles of Sidney’s theory into the vastly changed conditions of postmodernity. Specifically, their book titles identify distinct but overlapping ways of conceiving the situation of poetry within the modern knowledge system. In <i>The Reach of Poetry</i>, after setting out a conceptual framework, Cook begins with the modern period and writes back to the beginnings of European poetry, concluding with a return to some modern poets writing in various languages, European and English. His aim is to show how poems across the whole “reach” of the European tradition achieve wisdom as their highest accomplishment, in complex interaction with each other in the mind of a reader (who can also be a poet). As he writes in opening his last chapter, “Poetry, at the quick of its expression, always preserves as well as transmits what has gone before, not just the rhetorical postures of tradition but the processes and acts of thinking that they serve and that underlie them. For modern poetry – or poetry since Baudelaire – the range of integrative gestures is very great, but at their best they do not entail contradictions of one poet by another, even when the choices may involve exclusions” (1995: 249).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Cook’s qualifications, like Sidney’s, emphasise a continuity of purpose within a widening diversity of expressions which is to be understood by reference to the best instances of poetic practice throughout European history. Bernstein takes another route to a similar end, clearly expressed in his title, <i>Attack of the Difficult Poems: Essays and Inventions</i>. He identifies a situation for modern poetry which contrasts completely with Sidney’s praise of poetry as that professional mode of language use which has the power to address “popular judgments” (1973: 97), based on the view that modern media have abrogated this role: “The reinvention, the making of a poetry for our time, is the only thing that makes poetry matter. And that means, literally, making poetry matter, that is making poetry that intensifies the matter or materiality of language – acoustic, visual, syntactic, semantic. Poetry is very much alive when it finds ways of doing things in a media-saturated environment that only poetry can do” (2011: 30). At their best, postmodern poems are characterised by a “high syntactic, grammatical, or intellectual activity level; elevated linguistic intensity; textual irregularities; initial withdrawal (poem not immediately available); poor adaptability (poem unsuitable for use in love letters, memorial commemoration, etc.); sensory overload; or negative mood” (4). Bernstein would agree with Cook that poems do not displace each other in the way that new knowledge in the sciences displaces earlier knowledge. Instead, he invokes a situation where each new poem (at its best) may challenge not only thought as such but thought about poetry: “While poetics brings to mind a long history of laws of composition, poetics can also stress poiesis – the actual making or doing; poetry as process. Every doing carries the potential of something new, emergent, something not already predicated by poetics. Practice overtakes theory, practice changes theory” (73), a process which, when the “doing” is reading and rereading, he elsewhere refers to as “reinhabitation” (255).</p>
<p class="noindent1">“Something new, emergent, something not already predicated”. At the heart of this discussion, Sidney, Cook and Bernstein agree that the best poems possess the capability of going beyond the known. To think the thought of a postmodern poem is a reflective, deliberative, recursive process not governed by ordered narrative, the formal patterns of rhyme and metre, or the constant presence of a poet/narrator/speaker. It assumes a mode of consciousness as a flowing together of many dimensions of knowledge, experience, self-awareness, memory, association, belief, relationship with others, which has been finely characterised by DeLillo as “mindlife”: “Two near strangers in night confinement inside the laboring drone of a small car, coming out of long silences to speak abruptly, out of long thoughts and memory chains and waking dreams and every kind of mindlife, the narrative that races just behind the eyes, their words sounding clean and shaped in the empty night” (1992: 27). Like a poem, their words exist in the shared space between their private states of mind, their meaning as much a function of the hearer’s reception of them as of a deliberately formulated meaning by the speaker, an exchange in which hidden states of consciousness and incommensurate, unconnected life histories which are being composed moment by moment, are momentarily linked and mediated by a common language.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Mindlife, the condition and quality of being conscious, self-aware, sharing an external world and yet always distanced, always relating to it through the screen of a private and fluid life historical narrative, on the one hand, and whatever compilation from the collective resources of the semiosphere have become part of that knowledgable self-construction, is a brilliant term for what Sidney refers to in the phrase “zodiacke of his own wit” and makes more explicit the nature and mobility of the singular mind from which poems among other forms of creative thought issue. That the creating mind is always already informed by shared resources of knowledge means that the subjective origin of the poem does not disqualify its claim (or claims made on its behalf) to truthfulness. Sidney noted that the exemplary poet in his theory is both entirely free to create without submission to any external authority (“no law but wit”) and yet applies a discipline to the flow of creative energy and intelligence which he refers to as “learned discretion”. I would suggest that this is not to be read as self-censorship but as a recognition that to communicate truth humanistically (to teach by delighting) requires the use of a shared language, shared conventions of expression for sense-making, and a shared resource of valued knowledge which ranges as far back in time and across languages and cultures to the extent that it is available to any poet and that poet’s community of readers. Bernstein and Cook (and Luhmann) would also agree with Sidney that absolutely integral to this capability is the origin of the poem in a singular mind. For Cook, “There is a wisdom in the best poetry that makes it universal, rather than just subjective, though such wisdom derives from the engagement of a subjectivity” (1991: 317). For Bernstein, ‘The poets I most care about are, maybe, trying to become human – or nonhuman; anyway, they are not so quick to assume what the human is or how it manifests itself” (2011: 244).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Being able to apprehend and realise in mind that which is not but should or could be in experience and the modes of living that a society values and seeks to develop in its members, and to find ways of communicating those apprehensions to other minds so that they can initiate further thought about what could be known of and done in the world, is the work of what Bernstein calls “the difficult poem”. For Sidney, to write such a poem required an imaginative encounter with ideal forms of life already modelled in antiquity and accessible through the “highest knowledge” and wisdom (110), true knowledge not just rationally received but passionately embraced in an action of apprehending and loving the good, what Sidney refers to as “to perceive the beauty of virtue” (117), and enacting that love in a way which “extendeth itself out of the limits of a man’s own little world to the government of families, and maintaining of public societies” (105). For postmodern democracies, the issue is what diversity of forms of life and value are consistent with the principles underpinning democracy as a concept of popular sovereignty grounded in the equality of individual citizens profoundly concerned with the distribution and management of social power and wealth. There is no ideal model sanctioned by antiquity to be imitated, but situated minds to be shaped by thinking critically with already achieved knowledge derived from local experience as well as the semiosphere, and lives and societies to be shaped by the embodiment and enactment of those thoughts. For Cook, “The pragmatic situation of a poem is deep and complicated, responding to conditions that reach through the whole society. […] poetry is a sort of seismograph for changing assumptions” (1995: 54). He argues for a conception of the poem as coming into being between two poles of discourse/language use, conversational and oracular, which combine in a specific way in the nineteenth century to constitute the democratic poem. This polarity locates the poem within two modes of relation to society and culture, the circulation of collectively accumulated and objectified knowledge and meaning in ordinary language, on the one hand, and individual apprehension, without other authorisation, of states and conditions beyond the limits of the currently known, on the other.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For Bernstein, “Poetry’s social function in our time is to bring language ear to ear with its temporality, physicality, dynamism: its evanescence, not its fixed character; its fluidity, not its authority; its structures, not its storage capacity; its concreteness and particularity, not its abstract logicality and clarity. […] Poetry in a digital age can do more than simply echo the past with memorable phrases. It can also invent the present in language never before heard” (2011: 105). He affirms that the relation between the difficult poem and its readers is open-ended and interactive, such that the outcome of any act of interpretation can be both socially and culturally formative, and at the same time provisional and incomplete because other acts by other readers will also affect the meanings of the “fluid mosaic” (248) of a poem, a term which can equally serve as a figure for a society’s cultures and histories:</p>
<p class="quote">There is no end to what you might need to know to read a poem and maybe no beginning either. In my textual economy, each poem is an initiation into a world of particulars both inside and outside the reader’s information databank. […] all that’s needed is a willingness to jump into the middle of a flow of experience, just as you do every time you open the door to your house onto that other world we sometimes call everyday life. The fact is that as a culture we don’t share a fixed set of given, all-purpose, cultural and historical reference points or, in so far as we do, there are relatively few of them and, taken as topological points, they make an inadequate map of our history, our contemporaneity, our aspirations and destinies (252).</p>
<p class="noindent1">To create a more adequate map requires estranging the normality of the everyday by contrasting the transparent realist norm (the world “out there” operating coherently under one clock) with the discontinuity of singular perceptions and chronologies and membership of a society lacking a “fixed set” of “cultural and historical reference points”. Thomas Nagel gives a different inflection to this contrast by taking conscious life, in which actual and imaginable are inherently combined, as the reference point for thinking about values: “It would be a mistake to try to find a common denominator such as pleasure and pain to accommodate in a single realist conception the diverse values that are generated by all the actual, not to mention imaginable, forms of life. Instead, value must be seen as pluralistic. The domain of real value, if there is such a thing, is as rich and complex as the variety of forms of life, or at least of conscious life.” (2012: 119).</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the poem which satisfied Sidney’s idea of the true poem presented to its reader or hearer perfected models of human living, it made them accessible by using linguistic means which were quite familiar to everyone – narrative, vivid imagery, the musical affectivity of rhythm and sound - and so skilfully that the language itself dissolved into the imagined (fictional) world evoked by the poem. For Bernstein, the opposite is the case: “If poetry in analphabetic culture maximizes its storage function through memorisable language (formulaic, stressed), then poetry in the age of postliteracy (where cultural information is stored orally, alphabetically, and digitally), is perhaps most fully realized through refractory – unmemorizable – language (unexpected, nonformulaic, dis-stressed)” (103). It is in language freed from the obligation to create a world according to the conventions of realist narrative, and able to separate words from their referential function by foregrounding their conceptual and cultural work, that the difficult poem manifests what otherwise, Sidney argued, made the poem distinctive as a mode of access to the highest kinds of learning – the authority of the individual mind objectifying its singular thought of the to-be-known in writing. Instead of signifying rational structure and realist spatial construction, the poem for Bernstein is an environment of incommensurable sights and sounds – “‘a dimension of mind’” (117) which achieves expression in McGann’s n-dimensional text - in which a reader is able to “try out alternative ways of thinking, to listen to the way language sounds before trying to figure out what it means, to lose yourself in a flurry of syllables and regain your bearings in dimensions otherwise imagined as out of reach” (17). Cook offers a similar if more restrained view of the core experience of reading a poem when he writes that “Modern poetry’s very uncertainties move it into a sort of questing” (1995: 52); “The self is two selves, that of before the poem and that of after. But these two selves are, as it were, split and re-joined in a time sequence. The same self is split and rejoined through the epiphany that spreads ‘evenly’ through the poem” (51). These metaphors re-present Sidney’s conception of a fictional narrative which can effect change in the actual world through transforming a reader’s self-knowledge by displacing certainties in the interests of discovery, the ideal in the interests of the emergent. As Bernstein puts it, echoing and modifying Cook’s “reach” of poetry, “The poem is an initial point of embarkation on journeys yet to come, on earth as they are in the imaginary space between here and there, now and then, is and as” (255). The effect of the poem is aporetic, in Calvino’s (1998: 67-68) metaphor revealing that the real is a bridge we build narratively for ourselves (and must continue to build) across a void.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Postmodern poetic space is constituted mentally and realised intersubjectively through languages and other media technologies in textual objects constituted by the actual and the imaginable and the attempt to transcend the cultural boundaries of both. In respect of its mix of order and multiplicity, it is a dimension of what Boisot has termed the I-space; in another, it is the space of cultures and cultural artefacts. The material real in all its mysteriousness and enormity is not a limit; the scope of poetic thought is a function of the combinatory capabilities of the elements of the language system energised by a singular mind. As Satan observes in <i>Paradise Lost</i> (1. 254-55), “The mind is its own place, and in itself / Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.” A fine example of the postmodern form of this poetic space of consciousness and invention is offered by Bernstein in some reflections on a volume of Mapuche poetry, translated from Mapudungun into Spanish by the poets, and then into English. In an essay entitled “Our Americas: New Worlds still in Progress” he offers it as an exemplary instance of his term Americas, which signifies “the multiplicity of our senses of America” (67). He expands on what he means by multiplicity through a double analogy which is highly relevant to understanding the conditions of postmodern poetic thought and the knowledge which may be derived from it:</p>
<p class="quote">I am suggesting that we conceptualize our Americas as a hypertextual or syncretic constellation, with alphabetic, glyphic, and a/oral layers. A constellation is an alternative model for understanding what is often characterized as fragmentation, parataxis, isolation, insularity, atomization, and separate development. Hypertextuality maps a syncretic space that articulates points of contact and that potentiates both spatial connections among discrepant parts and temporal overlays that merge or melt into one another (69).</p>
<p class="noindent1">A hypertextual or syncretic constellation. A fluid mosaic. Imaginary space. A text of n-dimensions with reach across all times and spaces. A bridge across the void. Postmodern metaphors and concepts for thinking about the poem, but also a cultural-historical variation upon Sidney’s foundational concept of “no law but wit” which marks the poem’s emergence from singular acts of radical thought and linguistic creativity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For Sidney, one dimension of the work of a writer in English in his time was to assist in the creation of an English language capable of the heights of artistic and learned achievement of the classical and Renaissance European languages. For Cook, to read comparatively across the reach of European poetry it is necessary to master the languages in which that poetry is written, and the cultural histories in which they are enmeshed. In both instances, a multi-lingual practice. For Bernstein, facing globalisation in media and commerce, there is a triple imperative: “Read globally, write locally” (77), and think hypertextually. To do this in the new world of North and South America requires interconnection and translation among the constellated texts of the multiple languages, sign systems, cultures and histories of the continent in the search not for universal truths or validating traditions but for what is indigenous. The volume of Mapuche poetry locates the complex cultural politics inherent in this search; perhaps, Bernstein writes, “what makes this <i>indigenous</i> for our Americas is not the single strand of the Mapudungun but the braided layers of the aboriginal, the colonial, the immigrant: specifically the joining of any two against a third, which is perceived to be the greater threat” (69). The imaginative space in which the Americas can be invented is the space of thought populated by the contents of the semiosphere, among which the poem, as linguistic fiction, provides an opening on to what is not yet in reality but can be written into existence from and in the evolving languages of the Americas.</p>
<p class="noindent1">These views retain the ancient meaning of prophecy and the Muses as marking an intermediary space between the known and the unknown, the poet’s linguistic and aesthetic powers providing a vehicle for making the as yet unknown apprehensible in some way.<sup><a id="note_15" href="#note15">15</a></sup> Bernstein and Cook claim that poetry, oracular or difficult, is a fundamental means by which the boundaries of the known can be crossed and shifted. But, critically, the boundaries and their crossings are mental constructs and mental events, and their modification is discursive, in the power of language in the full range of its characteristics and qualities to objectify thought and to reformulate it as knowledge. The transaction/crossing occurs as a mental event, an innovation in thought which is itself an act but which may also be embodied in social acts in specific times and places.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If Sidney’s exemplary poem aims to offer its readers narrative fictions of their perfectibility which they can live out, transforming both themselves and the actual world in the process, Bernstein’s difficult poem aims to engage its readers in constellated thinking generated by immersion in the complexities of ordinary language. As a linguistic genre, it is the novel which powerfully continues Sidney’s conception of poetic fiction, and which can fulfil the same purpose of leading readers into worlds (especially worlds of thought) beyond their ordinary experience. But, as the capacity for considered thought is diminished by the pressure of the technologically generated and globally distributed image, its rhetorical excess and informational impoverishment (its appropriation of the poetics of narrative fiction according to the conventions of what Bernstein calls technorationality (78)), other conceptions of the poetic come into play. In Cook’s and Bernstein’s terms, it is the sheer complexity of what ordinary language can signify when employed poetically which underpins the claim that the poem is the key to opening the potential for innovation in thought. A good example is Cook’s discussion of Wordsworth; to bring fully to knowledge the nature of the transformations in thought and poetic form which are accomplished by his poems requires exploring the imaginative space in which what it means to be human is being placed in question at his time, an approach comparable to Bernstein’s concern with “the multiplicity of our senses of America”. In respect of a changing conception of the poet, Cook writes that “Insofar as Wordsworth’s poems are an unbridled conversation, they imply the dialogic contract of an open-ended democratic society, a world that borrows the attributes of private sociability rather than those just of public self-presentation. But to the degree that he presents himself as an oracle, he acts as a prophet, the aristocrat of nature, who behaves in a profoundly different way, and by profoundly different rules, from Pope, who was an aristocrat of society” (1995: 59). To investigate more fully the implications of this change would require understanding the poet’s “deep assumptions [which] would involve attention to historical conditions, and a description of them would be endless. Industrialization, attention to the sublime, and a threshold consciousness, Wordsworth’s ‘something evermore about to be,’ would surely figure in such a description” (72). Ever impending, the poem is a threshold between the known and the unknown; but it is also an instance of that always emergent human complexity which it is the task of the poem to think, and of language pre-eminently to signify.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The poetic text presents and records thought in language, not as the copy of an original but by writing thought into existence in an imaginary space.<sup><a id="note_16" href="#note16">16</a></sup> Neither the objects of the given world nor poems are themselves knowledge, but provide objects to think with, and about and from which knowledge can be derived. A principal difference is, of course, that poetry is made of the same stuff as knowledge, that is, language, and because of that draws from (“imitates”, in Sidney’s terminology) existing collective knowledge and the writer’s life experience and learning as sources of the materials it employs. The (difficult) poem is both a linguistic artefact and a fictional construction (“the ground plot of a profitable invention”).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The poem is an incalculable and momentary crystalisation of the poet’s mindlife, engaging the resources of the language system, the contents of personal and collective memory, knowledge derived from experience and social learning, the complex cultural, political, artistic and economic architecture of the world of the poet’s present, and the forces impelling change in that world. Its thought is seismographic, bringing deep cultural processes to consciousness. The poem becomes a textual event in the semiosphere when published; when it intervenes in the mind of a reader it can generate an event in thought which may issue as another poem, or a text (exposition, interpretation, commentary, theory) extending formal knowledge, and/or as an event in social reality by being localised and embodied (translated and interpreted) in conversation and action by a singular mind/person. When translated into other languages or instantiated in different media, it is all these things but also something other than itself as it adapts to the different world construction of the new language or the different materiality of the new medium. Each of its versions will mean differently in some ways, marking out the distinctively accumulative, diffusive and recursive route towards wisdom and truth taken by knowledge in the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sidney produced his theory of poetry at an early stage of a cultural transition in Europe of importance as vast as the most recent epistemic shift, of which digital information and communications technologies are a sign, an instrument and an effect. Literate communication was then available only to a small percentage of the male population, and very few women; as his examples and metaphors emphasise, to be a “right popular philosopher” (1973: 109) was to speak (and write) in a mode able to reproduce the communicational forms of the pervasive oral culture while aiming for high artistic achievement. The literate segment of this audience (readers as well as hearers) was also addressed in writing which rewarded extensive learning and aesthetic and linguistic sophistication, epic and metaphysical poetry being two examples (the same is now the case, for example, in cinema). However, in the twenty-first century, even though a poet’s speaking directly to a present audience and giving a singular voice to the words on the page or the screen is taken to be an instance of the least technologically mediated and therefore the most authentic mode of communication, its context is a social reality in which communication is increasingly technologically mediated and self-reflexive thought is typically too complex to be expressed or understood with any fullness using the means of speech and oral memory. The form of the poem and the transaction between poet and audience which is exemplary for postmodern poetry is written rather than spoken; the reader, in Luhmann’s words, is “plunged into the open, undetermined space of a medium’s possibilities” (153) and exposed to what is potential in the language of the time.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s5.16"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-16">5. Poetry and philosophy in a new humanities</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">As borders demarcating clusters of text in the semiosphere are adjusted over time, as new kinds of text and medium are invented, and as theories and beliefs about the nature of the relation between author, text, reader, history, culture and society change, so the scope and meaning of terms like “literature”, “poem”, “poetics”, and “poetry” develop critically and philosophically. However disruptive to established knowledge these changes can be, and however they might be resisted, the text objects with which they are concerned persist and in their singular existence may challenge any theory or category applied to them. This crucial and distinguishing feature of knowledge work in the humanities is demonstrated by the three writers about poetry discussed above. Although they all share a common focus (the poem), a common tradition (European poetry), and a common profession (literary criticism), each is differently positioned in time, interests and professional identity, a positioning which explicitly marks the distinctive intellectual trajectories and immediate purposes of their texts. While I have sought to draw some key themes pertinent to my interests from their work, in the process implicitly engaging their larger arguments and selection of texts and times with my own, the contexts in their discussions from which I have drawn ideas and quotations also shadow and critique the use I have made of them.</p>
<p class="noindent1">My purpose now is to extend from literary criticism to philosophy the scope of my case for the poem within the more general category of the art work as the primary source for the creation of new knowledge in the humanities. In respect of relations between academic discourses, the professional politics engaged by Sidney have only complicated, now not least because of the powerful links between philosophy, linguistics, computing, and cognitive and neuro-science. The position adopted by Sidney on the knowledge work of the philosopher in his analysis of which professional linguistic discipline – history, philosophy and poetry – was the best for teaching true knowledge remains common (and notably in the humanities) even in this period of the astonishing multiplication of expert languages: “For his knowledge standeth so upon the abstract and general, that happy is that man who may understand him, and more happy that can apply what he doth understand” (1975: 107). But Sidney also recognises a proper distinction between “learned” and “popular” relations to knowledge, the philosopher in professional and disciplinary practice addressing other experts in philosophy. This distinction has been massively elaborated and entrenched by the expansion of expert knowledge through the modern period, but it is the period of the postmodern which has most dramatically produced a crisis in the conception of expert knowledge in the humanities. Sidney’s humanistic model, which is based in literate education and a theory of communication to a general audience and which has persisted in Anglo-American universities, has been challenged by the irruption of theory and the development of highly complex, conceptualised (philosophical and political) modes of textual analysis associated with European writers like Barthes, Foucault and Derrida. From my point of view, this crisis has established clearly the terms through which the intellectual grounds for expert humanities practice must be articulated. The issue is fundamentally different from the earlier twentieth century adjustment of the humanities as an intellectual project to the rational modes and conventions of scientific thought because it affirms a differently rational ground in concepts and practices which are intrinsic to the cultural/textual/medial materials of the humanities. In this respect, even though the literacy of that segment of Western populations who have experienced undergraduate tertiary education in the humanities could not be described as general literacy, the gap between that level of intellectual formation and the most advanced practice of theoretical textual analysis is very significant.</p>
<p class="noindent1">My purpose here, however limited by my own literacy, is to affirm the fundamental importance of the most rigorous and expert modes of textual analytical work in the humanities because they affirm the actual complexity of human thought and the diverse modes of its social and cultural realisation and communication throughout human history. By keeping the poem in view, but by stepping outside the domain of the disciplines which have evolved in the most proximate relation to aesthetic texts and into philosophy, it becomes possible to obtain a purview on the whole field of the postmodern humanities. At least, the work of Alain Badiou presents such an opportunity, an effect of his work (if not his own purpose) being a re-visioning of the place of the humanities in the orders of postmodern knowledge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I should comment a little more on “opportunity”. “Badiou” as a name in the semiosphere collocates a diversity of texts written by him in French, not all philosophical, many of which are now translated into other languages, and published interviews and academic commentary and critique. As he has noted, his name and not a discipline or an institution is the address of his works in the semiosphere (2008: 29). His major texts are written to and for philosophers, and engage complex and fundamental questions which have their roots in the origins of Western thought. The writers throughout history whom he directly writes into his work are European, and he is unqualified in his affirmation that discovering truths is the work of thought, even if that work has no possibility of closure: “Every thought is polemical. It is no mere matter of conflicting interpretations. It is about conflicts in existential judgments. This is why no real conflict in thought reaches a full resolution” (1998: 50). He sees in his own major works a process of evolution in thought, in part deriving from reciprocal critique among contemporary philosophers. A reader encountering his texts by whatever accident of discovery and sequencing, and in translation, will not necessarily construct “Badiou’s thought” as Badiou himself, or any of his philosophically expert readers, will conceive it. But this is typical of transmission and dissemination in the semiosphere and hence the humanities, where texts can constitute events in thought that open possibilities for discovery unanticipated by them because of the contexts into which they are drawn by a reader who is dislocated physically, linguistically and culturally from the place and time of their composition. Among all the ways in which writers about his work conceive of his importance to philosophy as a knowledge project, I was initially attracted by his placing of mathematics and poetry at opposite ends of a spectrum of modes of writing while also defining them as conditions of philosophy, and it is this aspect of his work that I wish to draw into my consideration of innovation in the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Badiou places himself in the Platonic line, as does Sidney. Both share a refusal to be tied to the physical real as the determinant of the possibilities of true knowledge, they both foreground the mental work of thought as critical to the apprehension of truth, they both claim language as the primary medium of thought, and they both seek to rescue poetry from Plato’s critique. Like Sidney nearly five hundred years ago, Badiou grounds his analysis in a set of relations which brings the contemporary parts of the whole body of knowledge into a comparative and qualitative relation with each other, presenting them as discursive acts of human thought. The temporal distinction between them which matters for my purposes here is that between a belief, shared by Sidney and Milton, in the pre-existing unity and completeness of truth which is to be recovered by human thought and action, and the cultural move undertaken in Europe and its global extensions in subsequent centuries which installed the open and always receding horizon of the future as the point of reference for knowledge work. The dominant progressivist and empirical foundation of this modern conception, which has now authorised science as the source of true knowledge and business and the economy as the principal focus of government, has always been accompanied by its obverse, both in terms of knowledge traditions (the bodies of alternative and indigenous knowledge animating the critique of modern western scientific agricultural and medical knowledge and practice, for example), and intellectual work in the creative arts and cultural theory.<sup><a id="note_17" href="#note17">17</a></sup> In the latter domains of enquiry, which are neither progressivist nor conventionally empirical, claims to truth remain provisional and contested, the objects which underwrite the claims being themselves open to multiple interpretations. As I have argued in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a>, if the physical objects of nature (the given or real world, including ourselves) are the objects of scientific enquiry, the semiotic objects (texts) of culture are the objects of humanities enquiry.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s5.17"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-17">5.1 On the margins</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Badiou’s reflections on the purpose and contexts of his thought are of great value in clarifying distinctive aspects of thought in the humanities. One starting point is similar to Sidney’s concern with the low esteem for poetry and, in fact, to most recent commentators on the humanities: “Philosophy is affected by a malaise and what I shall term a delocalization: it no longer knows if it has a proper place” (2008: 3). This illness, it might be said, is socially induced: “the problem is one of knowing if, in the world as it is, there is the slightest chance for such an enterprise [as philosophy] to flourish or be heard” (2005b: 39). In considering how to redress the situation of philosophy, he affirms that it is “necessary to ask what philosophy’s relation to life is. This question is fundamental. If you can’t say what purpose philosophy serves from the point of view of the true life, then it’s just one more academic discipline” (2013: 114). Adding the qualification “true” adds a thinking subject, knowledge, a decision process, and a moral goal (“The true life […] consists in living under the sign of the Idea” (2013: 111)) to life as a biological given, what he calls “chaotic prodigality” (2006: 79).</p>
<p class="noindent1">What this orientation towards the true life means for philosophy is also what I believe it means for the humanities: “Philosophy is, then, three things. It’s a diagnosis of the epoch: what does the epoch propose? It’s a construction, on the basis of this contemporary proposition, of a concept of truth. And, finally, it’s an existential experience relative to the true life. The unity of the three is philosophy” (130). Boisot’s concept of the I-space as a virtual space of multiple orientations of knowledge (political, institutional and organisational condensations sited in time and positioned relatively by the axes of concrete-abstract, undiffused-diffused, uncodified-codified), and Lotman’s semiosphere as the totality of textual representations of thought (both discussed in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a>), are other versions of Badiou’s dynamic conception of thought and its incalculable productivity which must be (re)claimed for the humanities in the current world knowledge order so that knowledge work in the humanities can be recognised as creative of new knowledge as necessary to human evolution as is the knowledge created by science and technology.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There are four steps into Badiou’s thought which I will take to engage with his conviction that “thinking, our thinking, is essentially tied to the infinite” (2006: xvi), how it is distinguished from the current emphasis upon the productivity of science, and how it changes the grounds upon which the importance of the humanities can be understood: the relation of philosophy to other modes of thought (the conditions of philosophy) which he calls registers or truth procedures; axiomatic thought; the relation between thought and event; and the formation and communication of thought focused in the question of writing.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s5.18"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-18"><i>5.1.1 Truth procedures</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">It is, first of all, important to state an axiom, which unequivocally locates the materialist framing of his thought: “In a world, there are only bodies and languages, except that there are truths” (2013: 109). It has the impersonality and disruptiveness which he attributes to “the cold rationality of mathematics” (2006: 15) and the power of mathematics to effect an “estrangement of intelligence” (12); placing it in the foreground here ensures that the fundamental ground of his approach to the question of philosophy and its conditions is unequivocally stated.</p>
<p class="noindent1">He writes that philosophical diagnosis of the epoch requires that philosophers “begin to take stock of the current becoming of truths within the fourfold registers of science, and particularly of mathematics; of politics, and particularly of the end of the age of revolutions; of love, and particularly that which psychoanalysis introduces into it of light, and shadow; and of art, particularly poetry since Rimbaud and Mallarmé” (2008: 14). These four registers of modern (Western) secular knowledge constitute the conditions for philosophy as that mode of thought capable of discerning the truths that are differentially or partially apprehended in the four registers but rendered incoherent or inaudible by the corporate media systems of their epoch; they “comprise an epoch, a dynamic of thought, in which each and every subject is inscribed”, on the basis of which philosophy “tries to think a concept of the contemporary” (2013: 114). Science, politics, art and love interact in the built environment of the city, “which is the name of assembled humanity” (2005a: 16).</p>
<p class="noindent1">From this perspective, “Philosophy comes to consist in an invitation, a path, a point of access to what, in the place of Truth, is brought out into the open” (2008: 15-16). I take “the open” here to mean not only the space outside the boundaries of what at any time is collectively known and an effect of the unpredictable interactions of forms of knowledge, but also the polysemous discursive space of the public domain in contrast to the disciplined space of academic institutions. And what better a way is there of thinking about the orientation of the humanities to thought than in the terms “an invitation, a path, a point of access”, a way into “the labyrinth of meaning” (2008: 13)? If Badiou writes for postmodern philosophy, not as a domain in the humanities but as the principal means of discovering truths in human knowledge, I would like to think that Bernstein is writing for the postmodern humanities when he affirms that “There are no core subjects, no core texts in the humanities, and this is the grand democratic vista of our mutual endeavour in arts and letters, the source of our greatest anxieties and our greatest possibilities” (2011: 8).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Furthermore, the “point of access” can be usefully made more specific. In an essay entitled “One, Multiple, Multiplicities” Badiou contrasts two methods of thinking, in one of which the historical accumulation of texts recording thought persists in an active relation to contemporary thinking, through a reference to “problems that have power, that is to say, to those problems whose solution matters to the dual becoming of thought and what it thinks. Galois once said that the problem was constituted by reading ‘the unknown’ into the texts of one’s predecessors. […] By not following this logic of the unknown, which functions like a strict selection principle for productive forms of thought, empirical prodigality becomes something like an arbitrary and sterile burden. The problem ends up being replaced by <i>verification</i> pure and simple” (2006: 79-80: emphasis in the original). This distinction is clearly not one which automatically distinguishes the humanities from the sciences, since “empirical prodigality” applies equally to the natural order and to the semiosphere; quite the reverse. It is only when thought in the humanities is focused on problems that have power by opening to the unknown through the n-dimensional space of the semiosphere that their productivity for thought can become properly apparent.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s5.19"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-19"><i>5.1.2 Axiomatic thought</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">The primary relation between the historicity of texts, the formulation of problems in thought by reading those texts against what they did not know, and the locating of these problems in relation to what is yet to be known identifies a conception of knowledge work which is fundamental to a humanities to-come. But the implications of that conception need to be made more explicit by attending to Badiou’s concept of thought and its axiomatic foundation. He states that “thought is not primarily a description or a construction but a break (with opinion, with experience), and hence a decision” (2006: 54). This is thought as “transversal” (145; cf 2005b: 45) to what is collectively known, the intellectual capacity to break with what is established and become free of the already thinkable (2006: 47-48) which is to be open to the unknown, and hence to possible truths. His opposition to what he sees as the relativism of postmodern thought and its denial that there are truths is a critical element in his claim for philosophy (and three of the four truth procedures) that thought as such (and not only scientific method) can reveal truths about the world. For Badiou, “a truth is, first of all, something new. What transmits, what repeats, we shall call <i>knowledge</i>. […] a truth begins with an <i>axiom of truth</i>. It begins with a groundless decision – the decision to say that the event has taken place […] a subject is what fixes an undecidable event, because he or she takes the chance of deciding upon it.” (2005b: 45-47; emphasis in the original). The coming of a truth into the world depends upon a subject’s being willing to accept indeterminacy rather than repetition and yet to make a determination by employing an axiom. Critically, this process creates a break by being discontinuous with what is already known, and because of the aleatory and contingent nature of “the decision to say”. The situation of human knowlng in the world as it is analysed here is superbly visualised at the point of entry into Badiou’s <i>Infinite Thought</i>:</p>
<p class="fig" id="fig5.1"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/ill5.1.jpg" /></p>
<p class="imagecaption">Illustration 1: Badiou, <i>Infinite Thought,</i> cover.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A good example of axiomatic thinking is the concept of choice, which accompanies concepts like indeterminacy, incalculability, and the unknown, and without which there can be no need or possibility for making decisions. As Badiou puts it, “Thus the Platonist will admit the axiom of choice rather than its negation, because a universe endowed with the axiom of choice is larger and denser in terms of intelligible relations than a universe that refuses to admit it.” (2006: 57). But the anchoring example, the axiom on which everything else is founded, is the proposition attributed to Parmenides, “The Same is both thought and Being” (1998: 52), which Badiou otherwise states as “the ‘co-belonging’ or ‘ontological commensurability’ of ‘the knowing mind and the known’” (2010: 109). It is this axiom which supports the proposition that “’truth’ is only ever the name of that through which thinking and being correspond to one another in a single process” (2006: 55).</p>
<p class="noindent1">There could not be a more fundamental proposition on which to found the truth claims and methods of a humanities to-come. This intent of this axiom, and the use of axiomatic thinking, is a core issue in Thomas Nagel’s <i>Mind and Cosmos</i>, where he challenges the current Western settlement on empirical science as the source of authoritative knowledge and writes that</p>
<p class="quote">Certain things can be assumed, if there is such a thing as reason. First, there are objective, mind-independent truths of different kinds: factual truths about the natural world, including scientific laws; eternal and necessary truths of logic and mathematics; and evaluative and moral truths. Second, by starting from the way things initially appear to us, we can reason collectively to achieve justified beliefs about some of these objective truths, though some of those beliefs will probably be mistaken. Third, these beliefs in combination can directly influence what we do. Fourth, these processes of discovery and motivation, while mental, are inseparable from physical processes in the organism” (2012: 85-86).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Like Badiou, Nagel seeks a basis for understanding which makes sense of human evolution and the difference it makes in the world, including the singularity of that evolution in this place in the universe (83). In particular, “Since the emergence of value is the emergence of both good and evil, it is not a candidate for a purely benign teleological explanation: a tendency towards the good. In fact, no teleological principle tending toward the production of a single outcome seems suitable. Rather, it would have to be a tendency toward the proliferation of complex forms and the generation of multiple variations in the range of possible complex systems” (122). We need, in other words, conceptions of ourselves and/in the given world which “make mind, meaning and value as fundamental as matter and space-time in an account of what there is” (20). Nagel argues that, when we reason, in the realm of values as well as facts, “Something has happened that has gotten our minds into immediate contact with the rational order of the world, or at least with the basic elements of that order, which can in turn be used to reach a great deal more” (83). Human thought and knowledge is just that, constituted by our humanity and our evolution in the singular biosphere of the Earth and yet capable of reaching beyond the limits of bodily experience and perception through thought as such and the symbolic and technological means humanity has developed to express, record, test and conserve that thought. It is also, fundamentally, grounded and opened out by singularly located minds and their ability to discover experientially something of what can be thought, in a moment involving an event, a choice, and a decision.</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s5.20"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-20"><i>5.1.3 Thought and event</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">So much of what constituted the coordinates of humanistic thinking in the West and exemplified by Sidney at the beginning of the modern period can be reaffirmed from this account. A truth (whether as always already given or as new) becomes accessible to thought by means of a singular event: for Sidney, the reader’s desiring reception of the poetically narrated Idea and its challenge to habitual thinking which is then brought to life by decision and embodiment in moral action in a specific time and place; and for Badiou, the momentary and unplanned perception of a set of relations in a specific time and place which constitutes an event that disrupts conventional knowledge by being named and so opens the singular subject of thought to new possible truths. The intersection of these transactions in both instances is the singular subject of thought, the embodied mind; the necessary locus of the process of truth is the situated mind enmeshed dialogically in the local and global society of minds, both present and past, and motivated to act in order to advance that process in the world.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Badiou characterises the totality of knowledge as a “swarming of forms of knowledge”, from one aspect manifested by “the encyclopedia of the situation”<sup><a id="note_18" href="#note18">18</a></sup> and from another by “the polymorphous interweaving of forms of knowledge that language continually elicits” (2008: 125). These metaphors emphasise the generativity of knowledge in the multiplicity of its forms as they interact within the vast heterogeneity of humanity’s languages. His conception of modern (Western) knowledge as the four conditions of philosophy proposes a mapping of the contemporary semiosphere as a virtual world comprising the textual continents of science, politics, love, and art (but what other continents are yet to be discovered or are rendered invisible by this map?), with philosophy as the metalanguage of Borges’ librarian in “The Library of Babel”, “a place in which”, just as in literary fictions, these continents in my figure “crossover or are compossible in time” (2008: 180).</p>
<p class="noindent1">In other words, Badiou provides an exemplary conceptual framework for re-thinking the humanities, one which steps outside the inherited disciplinary bureaucracy of university organisation while keeping the politics of knowledge firmly in mind. Taken together, his five terms (art, love, politics, science and philosophy) constitute a set of categorical divisions establishing a conceptual frame for a new humanities, most vividly grounded in his conception of “Authentic philosophy [which] begins, not in structural facts (cultural, linguistic, constitutional, etc) but uniquely in what takes place and what remains in the form of a strictly incalculable emergence”. (2008: xv). With this account of the grounds and forms of knowledge, inherited categories and values no longer need to dominate thinking about the purposes of the humanities; neither the impossible disjunctions of truth, reality and fiction, nor the institutional formation of now traditional disciplines established in relation to the literate evolution of languages, societies and cultures, nor the accompanying historical development of technological media and archives, need to determine the role of the humanities. Instead, the humanities can become directed by the infinite search for the truth of an event, the coming to be of humanity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In this brief compass, the reason of the humanities is disclosed. Not that Badiou refers to the current administrative collection of disciplines which sometimes remembers what it has in common under the term humanities; however oriented by and to philosophy, his discussion of thought and truth is resolutely located outside any particular institutionalised knowledge formation (while acknowledging the need of institutions to conserve the historicity of thought (2008: 29)). But he does, in the context of a conception of love as “the first opening-up of finitude, of the passage from the one to the two” (2013: 54), define “humanity” as that which “sustains the infinite singularity of truths that fall within these types. Humanity is the historical body of truths” (2008: 184). He affirms that “Humanity can be attested if and only if there is (emancipatory) politics, (conceptual) science, (creative) art, and love (not reduced to a mix of sentimentality and sexuality)”, which for me affirms that creating knowledge cannot be a value-free practice and that what we know of ourselves and our world is an unending and eventful process of discovery or encounter in time and place, a process which is carried out in our own time through the four types and for which the term humanity is their “knot” (2008: 185; Corcoran 2015: 185-189) or ultimate point of convergence. From this perspective the term the humanities names the historically accumulating body of knowledge which is integrated by the problem, What does it mean to be human?, and by a common set of reading and writing methods and practices (2013: 88-91).</p>
<h5 class="sec3" id="s5.21"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-21"><i>5.1.4 the question of writing</i></a></h5>
<p class="noindent1">These methods and practices are finely exemplified in Badiou’s work and his commentary on it. He distinguishes three different kinds of writing in an extended reflection on his relation as a writer to what he has written: “My aim [in writing philosophy] is to give to things that are already formed in my thought a protocol of transmission that is already satisfactory to me, personally. […] In the big books, in any case, I try to approximate as much as possible a detailed and argued expression of my thought; I’m in a rationality of transmission. In the other books, I seek above all to be clear and to ensure that the readers are fully on the level of what is being discussed; […] When I write theatre, it’s totally different. I don’t know myself exactly what I’m going to write” (2013: 88). A parallel categorisation emphasising different audiences would be expert/popular/creative; but this would not be consistent with his view that “philosophy addresses all humans as thinking beings because it assumes that all humans think” (2005b: 29) or that, following the structure of this statement, philosophy writes through him as a subject of thought. By contrast, when writing for the theatre, he attests to an openness and lack of prescription: “The architecture of a philosophical idea exists in itself; it has its own autonomy. […] But in a novel or a play, that which exists is co-extensive to the writing” (2013: 88-89). This distinction is consistent with Sidney’s contrast discussed above between writers “wrapped within the fold of the proposed subject” (1975: 102) and poets who are “makers of themselves, not takers of others” (131): “whereas other arts retain themselves within their subjects, and receive, as it were, their being from it, the poet only bringeth his own stuff, and doth not learn a conceit out of a matter, but maketh matter for a conceit” (120). Different modes of learned relation to the Idea can be adopted by any writer, different modes of transmission can be assimilated by any reader; these recognise the variety of literate identities which can be practised legitimately and productively in the articulation and transmission of thought, and which make up the virtual society of the semiosphere and the complex, multi-layered conversation of the humanities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There are three further aspects of writing which qualify this account in ways highly relevant to the humanities. Firstly, however disciplined by its architecture, philosophical writing is marked by its singular origin. As Badiou explains, “you try to focus directly on a universal but this engages your own singularity at the same time. […] This is very different from scientific culture, where a collectivity decides the norm. […] style is what attempts to hold together what is, in principle, philosophy’s absolutely universal vocation and the fact that there are few undertakings that are as radically singular. […] Style is, of course, the signature. ‘It’s by Alain Badiou.’” (2013: 90-91). It is clear why what is otherwise a very traditional conception of literary writing, one distinguishing between generic form and expression, is being activated here; Badiou wishes to protect the rationality of philosophical writing from the sophists’ rhetorical conception of language while protecting the singularity of a philosopher’s thought and its expression as a defining quality of philosophical writing.</p>
<p class="noindent1">His desire is further underlined by his sweeping condemnation of “the language, which governs us today: the language of communication and reality, the confused language of images […] which is the province of the media” (2006: 241). In contrast to the rational uses of language in any of the truth procedures, and the purpose of philosophy, media communication “transmits a universe made up of disconnected images, remarks, statements and commentaries whose accepted principle is incoherence. Day after day communication undoes all relations and principles, in an untenable juxtaposition dissolves every relation among the elements it sweeps along in its flow. And what is perhaps even more distressing is that mass communication presents the world to us as a spectacle devoid of memory, a spectacle in which new images and new remarks cover, erase and consign to oblivion the very images and remarks that have just been shown and said” (2005b: 30). By contrast, he argues for what could be called slow philosophy (2005b: 38), standing outside of the “speed of the world” and its “great incoherency”. Because philosophy’s “natural element is language”, the media system’s incoherent uses of language undermine the philosophical project of “reconstructing […] the category of truth.”</p>
<p class="noindent1">It could be inferred here that the fundamental contrast is between singular and collective or corporate authorship regardless of the medium, a contrast which founds the conventional distinction between scientific and humanistic knowledge creation in academic work even though it is the case that, in all academic fields and intensified now as a result of research assessment exercises and their quantitative bias, “a collectivity decides the norm.” It is Sidney’s position which establishes the more radical ground of authorisation, and which I am confident that Badiou would intend in his reference to style as signature – “no law but wit” signifies both the generativity of, and the social risk to, a singular mind’s exposure to the unknown or “the place of Truth” and the distinctiveness of the written record of that exposure.</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is striking that neither Badiou nor his philosophical commentators pay any attention to the constitutive role of the material medium in his emphasis upon the letter and writing as the mode of existence of thought. A notable example is <i>The Badiou Dictionary</i>, which declares its ranking of components of Badiou’s philosophy in the cover illustration, and confirms that ranking by what is not included in the index: language, letter, literature, novel, poem, art, medium, writing. There is some discussion of the poem in the dictionary entry on “Conditions”, “Cinema” gets an entry of its own, as do “Theatre” and “Linguistic Turn”; but “Poem” gets no entry, even though “Matheme” does. Badiou’s materialism does not seem to extend to a full consideration of the implications of the materiality of media technologies in the formation of thought, for example, the ways in which media shifts participate productively in changing conceptions of thought and knowledge.<sup><a id="note_19" href="#note19">19</a></sup> But in one respect he does: not by considering the relation previously discussed, in which the print monograph signifies as well as models the scholar’s intellectual work and its rationality, but the role of media in the conservation and memorialisation of that work, and even the possibility of its reaching a universal readership through time. As he writes, “I see written texts as that which remains. In order to remain, you have to write!” (2013: 88-89).</p>
<p class="fig" id="fig5.2"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/ill5.2.jpg" /></p>

<h3 class="sec1" id="s5.22"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-22">6. Mathematics and poetry as thought</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">“minds that can wander beyond all limit and satiety” (Milton, 1974: 220).</p>
<p class="noindent1">In his literary criticism, Badiou pays close attention to the ways in which the writers he discusses employ written language. Writing does not merely stand in for what it signifies; in his discussion of Pessoa, he writes that “Pessoa seems to tell us that writing is not a forever imperfect and obscure reminiscence of an ideal elsewhere. On the contrary, writing is <i>thought itself</i>, and nothing but” (2006: 41: emphasis in the original). From this fundamental point Badiou demonstrates throughout his work how philosophy, mathematics and poetry are related and differentiated as effects of written language.<sup><a id="note_20" href="#note20">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Philosophy discerns what is differently distinctive about the thought of mathematics and the thought of the poem as “these two extremes of language” (2006: 246). Their similarity is described in this way:</p>
<p class="quote">Mathematics is a fictive activation (<i>activation fictive</i>), in which existence in act is lacking. […] thought can activate the [arithmetic-] One or the [geometric] sphere from the experience of an organism or an object. What does this ‘activate’ mean? Precisely this: to treat an existent as if it were an act when it only exists potentially. It means […] taking something as separate that is not. […] what has the power to activate potential being? Or, what has the power to separate the inseparable? For moderns like us, it should be obvious that the answer to these questions is language itself. […] If I say ‘let a sphere,’ I separate it from every spherical object. At that point matheme and poem are indiscernible (1998: 46-47).<sup><a id="note_21" href="#note21">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">What these forms of writing have in common is a mental operation finding form in written language with no empirical referent, a fictional invention which does not merely make “castles in the air” but, as Sidney affirmed, gives a form to thought which could become, or be found already to be, a truth of the world. As extremes of language, they share with philosophy “the <i>common task</i>, which is to think what was unthinkable, to say what it is impossible to say” (2008: 246; emphasis in the original). They differ in that mathematics is characterised as “a form of writing subtracted from the poetics of natural language” (2006: 82), marked by a “literal univocity” (2008: 72) and “an argumentation that does not sustain itself on the basis of anything other than the imperative of consistency […] the matheme is that which, by causing the Speaker to disappear, by removing any mysterious validation from its site, exposes argumentation to the test of its autonomy and thus to the critical or dialogic examination of its pertinence” (2005b: 70). Mathematics is “ultimately a rigorous esthetics. It tells us nothing of real-being, but it forges a fiction of intelligible consistency from the standpoint of the latter, whose rules are explicit” (1998: 48). It is “a thought that is immediately written as thought, a thought that exists precisely only inasmuch as it is thinkable” (2005a: 19). “That mathematics thinks means in particular that it regards the distinction between a knowing subject and a known object as devoid of pertinence. […] discovery and invention are strictly indiscernible.” (2006: 56) “Mathematics is precisely the thinking which has nothing to do with the experiences of consciousness; it is the thinking which has no relation to <i>reality</i>, but which knots <i>letters</i> and the <i>real</i> together; a thinking faced with the void because it obeys the ideal of formalization” (2005a: 67).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Badiou’s analysis of the nature of the poem seeks to revise its Platonic banishment from the city by marking a fundamental change in the relation between mathematics and poetry as forms of written language. His anchoring conviction is that “thinking, our thinking, is essentially tied to the infinite. But the infinite as a form of being is mathematical, while the infinite as a resource for the power of language is poetic” (2006: xvi). On this ground, “the modern poem identifies itself as a form of thought. It is not just the effective existence of a thought offered up in the flesh of language, it is a set of operations whereby this thought comes to think itself” (2005a: 20). The poem no longer occupies a secondary relation to either the real or the ideal; instead, it is “a supplement, a chance, an incalculable, [that] throws us outside of ourselves” (2005b: 75). From the momentary conjunction of elements of language in a singular mind an event in thought emerges: ‘The poem presents itself as a thing of language, encountered – each and every time – as an event” (2006: 240), which Badiou understands to be “nothing other than the possibility of randomness in the structure of the world” (2006: 125), and therefore the possibility of choice and the need for decision. The modern poem “locally effectuates the infinite of language” (2005a: 25; compare with Luhmann’s phrase “unreachable horizon” (2000: 92)). By absolute contrast with the logical rigour, impersonality and transparency of the matheme, which frees thought by subtracting it from the situated complexities of language, Badiou describes the way to freedom opened by the poem as follows: “In order to be free with regard to the mystery in letters that the poem constitutes, it is enough that the reader dispose himself or herself to the operations of the poem – literally. The reader must will his or her own transliteration. […] You, me--summoned to the operations of the poem, we listen to the murmur of the indiscernible” (2005a: 34). The poem is “not a rule-bound crossing, but rather an offering, a lawless proposition” (2005a: 17).<sup><a id="note_22" href="#note22">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">The position established here places mathematics and poetry as forms of thought located at opposite ends of a linguistic spectrum. The matheme is an instance of thinking open to truths because it logically elaborates an argument from an axiom, itself sheerly a product of thought with no authorisation beyond itself, but observing with absolute strictness the requirements of mathematical discourse - consistency of logical deduction and the excision from its employment of “the letter” of a singular voice, metaphor, narrative and the polysemousness of the sign. The contrast with art as a truth procedure is striking. As Badiou puts it, “art’s irreducible cultural multiplicity” means that “Art is certainly the most implicated in the diversity of cultures, languages and historicities. A poem is rendered in a particular language” (2013: 68, 67). The poem is an instance of thinking open to truths because it elaborates a singular thought with no authorisation beyond itself out of the full resources of a particular language manifested in the “voice” of a singular mind, and is the product, the mark and the memory of a chance event. The poem, like the matheme, is an act of thought made manifest in writing; its effects are not registered through the public test of its argumentative rigour, as they are for the matheme, but through the process of transliteration which I take to denominate the process whereby each reader, desiring incorporation into the poem’s thought, provides for it a unique localisation or inhabitation.<sup><a id="note_23" href="#note23">23</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Both the matheme and the poem are written and neither are themselves forms of knowledge, but in writing in whatever media modality they become objects of knowledge. Both are instances of fiction because both create imaginary spaces in writing, without claiming any present verification or pre-existing reference for their thought, but fiction which opens access to the possible real as the site of truths yet to be discovered. For both, the horizon to thought is the infinite, that void which encloses the continuously expanding world of language and the semiosphere. It is the matheme and the poem which are the human means of intellection enabling humanity <i>by thought alone</i> to cross the borders between the semiosphere and the void/infinite, the known and the emergent, the calculable and the as yet unknowable.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A brilliant imagining of this fundamental situation can be found in a story by William Gibson (1986), “Hinterland”. As a result of the disappearance and then return of a space ship, a point in space is discovered which apparently gives access to another star system. Ships with just one crew member are sent in order to learn more, disappearing through “the point, the singularity – we call the Highway” (60) and returning without warning or pattern. Each return provides another fragment of evidence of the reality of that otherwise hidden world because seemingly random examples of utterly foreign biology or technology are found in each ship. But the crew member is psychologically destroyed, incapable of making any comprehensible report: “People are popping back off the Highway dead, or else they come back drooling, singing nursery rhymes. The live ones last about three days, won’t say a goddamned thing, then shoot themselves or go catatonic” (70).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Predictably, and as Badiou would expect, it is the greed “of an information-hungry global economy” (62) for the foreign (necessarily advanced) technologies and the knowledge incorporated in them which impels the continuing exploration, the destruction of the pilots (who choose to make the trip) being just a side effect. But this fiction is a profoundly serious attempt to imagine the psychological reality of crossing into/thinking the infinite void (a space without love, “an emptiness cold and implacable” (74)) and the risks and dangers which Badiou associates with the process of truth and its coordination in the free thought of the philosopher. “At the edge of the Highway every human language unravels in your hands” (71).</p>
<p class="noindent1">It is critically important to emphasise that the matheme and the poem are pathways to truths through “the letter”, which is not merely a vehicle for the transmission of thought but integral to the possibility of thought. As the extreme, opposite points in the ways by which thought and writing give access to (discover and invent) new truths, matheme and poem operate on the margins of language, where reason and meaning are threatened with unravelling, but also where the emergence of new truths becomes possible. For the postmodern, Badiou demonstrates that the foundational modes of thought which originate postmodern knowledge and hence postmodern humanities and are at the core of humanity’s capacity to invent new knowledge are (now) the matheme and the (postmodern) poem.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s5.23"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-23">7. Knowledge to-come in the Humanities</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">My purpose in this chapter is to rebalance the appropriation of innovation in knowledge by the sciences and their publicists by making a claim for the humanities and humanistic knowledge as an equally important if differently grounded source of innovation. Badiou’s work is aimed at resetting the structure of values which has shaped the period of scientific dominance in thought about knowledge and its purposes: “The positivist and empiricist approaches […] have been highly influential during the past two centuries […] The claim that science constitutes the one and only paradigm for the positivity of knowledge can be made only from within the complete disentanglement of philosophy and mathematics” (2006: 24). Reversing this disentanglement involves placing philosophy outside the four registers while making it dependent upon them as the means by which truths discovered in the work of the four registers can be conjoined and clarified; in the process, philosophy departs from its current location as one among other academic disciplines. He rejects the notion that philosophical writing can be regarded, in relation to each of the four conditions of philosophy, as “the tranquil aggregate of an aesthetics, an epistemology, an erotology and a political sociology” (2008: 43). In effect, he re-grounds the knowledge work carried on in the traditional and new humanities disciplines by re-distributing them among the four conditions as modes of writing and truth procedures occurring between the poles of the matheme and the poem. In accomplishing this work, he writes analyses of poems (and cinema, theatre, dance, and art) and presents them as instances of philosophy, not literary or other media criticism, commentary and interpretation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The challenge offered by Badiou to the humanities as a complex of disciplines evolved in relation to institutional change and new media technologies, the work of memory, the conservation and re-interpretation of collective knowledge, and to the open question, what does it mean to be human?, is to the purpose of humanities knowledge work and the grounds on which claims for its value can be made. Fundamentally, can true knowledge be created by acts of thought by singular minds expressed in some media form using the full resources of language?</p>
<p class="noindent1">If we begin from the position of a new, singular mind in relation to the encyclopedia, the predominant mode of thinking engaged in by that mind must be educational, in order to incorporate some portion of already existing collective knowledge. At any moment, however, simply because of the singularity of that mind both genealogically and situationally, the heterogeneity of languages, and the indeterminacy inherent to any situation, thought “beyond the information given”<sup><a id="note_24" href="#note24">24</a></sup> at such a moment can also occur. As Badiou writes, “The undecidable [is] a perpetual incitement to the exercise of inventive intuition” (2006: 55). This is to affirm a true equality of creativity and innovation as a universal human capability, as it does a mind’s dependence on access to as much of the power of language as that mind can sustain. A democratic conception of innovation includes events not only of the epochal scale discussed by Badiou in relation to the arts and politics but also of the local scale discussed by Carr and Bartlett.</p>
<p class="noindent1">When Badiou writes that a politics which is ”groping forward to declare itself” (1998: 56) is a “politics of subtracted singularities”, that is, a “politics of existence subtracted from the State”, he provides a language for grasping precisely what Milton declares in his last poems, at the foundation of parliamentary democracy.<sup><a id="note_25" href="#note25">25</a></sup> Both principal characters, The Son of God and Samson Agonistes, experience events in their situations in which the complexities of accumulating acts of thought are momentarily resolved by a decision which does not repeat existing models of decision or action but, by entering the void of the aporetic or incalculable, thus alters the possibilities of existence. These poems exemplify the view that “thought is not primarily a description or a construction but a break (with opinion, with experience), and hence a decision” (2006: 54). In the case of the Son of God, nothing actually happens immediately as a result of this event in thought; in the case of Samson, his historically transformative action at the moment it occurs shatters explanatory continuities. Neither the poet narrator, nor Samson, nor his audience, nor the reader, can claim any insight into Samson’s decision to act. Only later is the event reclaimed by conventional interpretation, drawn back into what Badiou calls the encyclopedia and Derrida the calculable by those of his “nation” with a stake in it, and in the process missing its truth. Linking Milton and Badiou across the centuries separating them shows how little the potential of the thought of parliamentary democracy has been fulfilled in the practice of modern states.<sup><a id="note_26" href="#note26">26</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">If the (difficult) poem, like the matheme, draws minds out of that part of the encyclopedia into which they have been incorporated towards new truths, then there is also a role for expert readers to assist that universality of possible readers to make more sense of what it is that the poet has brought back from beyond the borders of the known and into language. Badiou identifies a long-standing tension between “critical” and “creative” writing in the domain of literature when he asks, “To what, within thought, is poetry opposed?” and answers, “What poetry forbids is discursive thought, <i>dianoia</i>. […] Dianoia is the thought that <i>traverses</i>, the thought that links and deduces” (2005: 17). But the truths to which the poem opens access through thought can be rendered as knowledge because thought generated by the poem can find another textual body (signs, ink and paper, pixels on a screen) and so become a form of knowledge: “The word ‘knowledge’ must be reserved for what relates to an object, the object of knowledge. There is knowledge when the real enters experience in the form of an object” (2006: 241). In the case of the poem as object, this entry is by its transliteration into the mind of the singular subject of knowledge and its interpretation by interaction with the resources of language, including modes of discourse, available to that mind. The expert work of the humanities in the creation of new knowledge depends upon having means of access to the infinite of thought and language, the outside of the encyclopedia. Access is through the learned ability to read and write across some part of the totality of human knowledge (in Badiou’s terms, philosophy and the four registers of science, art, politics and love), but the two symbolic forms which most fully materialise the crossing between the known and the unknown in thought are the matheme and the poem (but also the work of art).</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s5.24"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-24">7.1 Writing space</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Before considering some instances which exemplify both Sidney’s and Badiou’s conceptions of the poem, there is one other aspect of writing and the materiality of the text in relation to the poem which I want to consider. Badiou writes that there is a need to “open up a space of thought that is not regulated according to the naming of the ʻthere is’ (this is what I call the operations of closure). The terms constituting this space are: indeterminacy, difference, subject, undecidability, atypicality, coupling, doubling, inclusion, genericity of the true. And a few others as well” (2006: 96). This space is named “the event”, but naming an event “is <i>always</i> poetic: to name a supplement, a chance, something incalculable, it is necessary to draw from the void of sense, in the absence of established significations, and to the peril of language” (2008: 42). The whole possibility of (and need for) transcending repetition in every aspect of thought and life is captured here, together with what is actually at stake in desiring the new. Transformations in thought and knowledge, whether at a local or global scale, in principle expose the settlements in thinking and institutions which secure social and disciplinary order over time. To become a subject of the (postmodern/difficult) poem is to experience exposure to a real (including ourselves) which always exceeds the knowledge we have of it. But that is not therefore exposure to vacancy, but to the potential of the real which only fully human thought can access and through which are always already woven moral, affectional, memorative, and political strands.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Badiou offers a compelling analogy at the end of his chapter discussing Philosophy and Art in <i>Infinite Thought</i> when he writes that “The poem marks the moment of the empty page in which the argument proceeds, proceeded, and will proceed. This void, the empty page, is not ‘all that is thinkable’. It is, on the contrary, under a rigorously circumscribed poetic mark, the means of saying, in philosophy, that at least one truth, elsewhere but real, exists, and drawing from this recognition, against the melancholy of those that regard from afar, the most joyful consequences” (2005b: 81). The possibility of a text’s coming into existence is signified by the empty page; the other minimum element necessary is the letter. It will seem banal to say that these two material things are the origin of a written object, a text. But, as Badiou’s use of the concept of the empty page indicates, a great deal can hang on how one thinks about it. And, not least, the notion of origin itself. As Luhmann (2000a: 55) writes, “One cannot start from an immediately given nondetermination – an unmarked space, a primordial entropy or chaos, a empty canvas or white sheet of paper – without distinguishing this state from what is being done to it,” It is only when writing starts that the situation of thought in reality, and the situation of reality in the semiosphere, is made fully evident.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a> I discussed “the text” and why I believe that such a term is needed to connect in one order the diversity of written or discursive objects, in whatever medium they exist. It is worth repeating Hayles’s axiom: “For information to exist, it must always be instantiated in a medium” (1997: 189). She does not write, “for thought to exist”, but access to others’ thought is utterly dependent upon its textual embodiment. Badiou’s page has literally and materially to be an unlined sheet of paper, not the virtual page of a word processing application which is already marked before intentional writing commences. In contrast to the white page of the print book, the digital screen is black, like outer space; when energised, the screen becomes busy, coloured, enacting a version of social reality, iconically staging all the attentional and political dispersals of thought as such which networked collectivities and their communicational protocols engender. When Hayles asks of Mark Z. Danielewski’s experimental novel, <i>Only Revolutions</i> (2007), what is the writing-down system?, she replies: “Cooperating in the authorial project are the software programs, network functionalities, and hardware that provide sophisticated cognitive capabilities, including access to databases and search algorithms. Networked and programmable machines are here much more than a technology that author uses to transcribe pre-existing thoughts. They actively participate in the composition process, defining a range of possibilities as well as locating specific terms that appear in the text. The author function is distributed, then, through the writing-down system that includes both human and nonhuman actors” (2012: 230).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Humanities scholars who have addressed the implications of this medium shift from print to digital have produced powerful insights into the relation between knowledge creation, media forms, institutional practices and social and economic change. Studies of the history of the book are one major outcome of this interest. Another exemplary instance is the work of David Jay Bolter and others in both theorising the implications of digital technologies for knowledge work and the new kinds of text which the new information and communications technologies could make possible, and creating software which enabled their theorising to be explored in practice. Out of this work came innovative authoring software, Storyspace, for the writing and reading of e-literature, and a publishing enterprise which made available new literary compositions to a readership interested in the potential for literature of the new digital technologies as writing and reading machines. The work of cultural theorists like Katherine Hayles, Alan Liu and Joseph Tabbi, the development of the Electronic Literature Organization (ELO), and the formation of a field of theory and practice under the term digital humanities all testify to the profound implications for knowledge work and artistic practice of the new digital medium beginning in the late twentieth century.</p>
<p class="noindent1">There is just one concept which I want to allude to here, the concept of “writing space”. Bolter (1991: 11) defines the concept as “the physical and visual field defined by a particular technology of writing. All forms of writing are spatial, for we can only see and understand written signs as extended in a space of at least two dimensions. Each technology gives us a different space. […] For medieval handwriting and modern printing, the space is the white surface of the page, particularly in bound volumes. For electronic writing, the space is the computer’s videoscreen where text is displayed as well as the electronic memory where it is stored. The computer’s writing space is animated, visually complex, and to a surprising extent malleable in the hands of both writer and reader. […] These different conceptual spaces foster different styles and genres of writing and different theories of literature. […] With any technique of writing […] the writer comes to regard the mind itself as a writing space. The writing space becomes a metaphor, in fact literate culture’s root metaphor, for the human mind.” One might, however, make the metaphor plural, the “different conceptual spaces” created by different media technologies fostering different conceptions of the human mind.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Bolter also makes it clear that writing as the externalisation of thought is an inclusive concept, and not restricted to the uses familiar to traditional (manuscript and print) alphanumeric literacy and the forms of the humanities associated with it. He notes that “Mathematics has been a special kind of writing at least since the evolution of modern notation in the seventeenth century. The set of mathematical equations that defines a physical theory is a symbolic text of the highest order. And science itself has been a formal language since the time of Descartes and Leibniz, or indeed Galileo with his claim that the book of nature was written in the language of mathematics” {9-10). It is obvious that the literal and conceptual languages of science and mathematics have fully asserted their dominance within the western knowledge system, and Badiou’s argument both recognises this development and proposes that it puts in place a profound limitation on the evolution of knowledge as the search for meaning and truth; as I have argued, his opposing the matheme and the poem as a complementary pair can recover the humanities as truth-formulating fields of enquiry founded on the written and conserved outcomes of thought in all natural and formal languages, without limitation on their expressive capabilitities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">However, a black sign on white space is the zero degree of writing, whether what is written is a mathematical equation or a musical score or a poem, an architectural drawing or dance notation, computer code or a chemical formula; in Luhmann’s (2000: 291) words, writing “understood as graph, fissure, design or contour”. It is writing at its most material and least referential, by which objects in the real are related to themselves and to human interests and values, become objects of knowledge and means to accomplish human purposes through knowledge about them. But in every case, it is writing which is designed to have an effect in/on the real, whether through a human or a machinic subject.</p>
<p class="noindent1">To face the lettered page as it is, and not as we are trained to use it as a transparent medium providing simulated access to the real and from which reading strips the informational content, is to face the disjunction between two models of thought and knowledge, one grounded in the multimedia moving image, the other in black-on-white language, and to foreground the work of thought inventing what is true and real as a passage through the full range of the human mind objectified by the semiosphere. The plastic space of the intersubjective mind is given momentary shape in writing as the black letters locate coordinates of possible thought; but, as Calvino imagined it (1998: 69) they constitute a bridge over the void, through which, in the white spaces between letters and words, the emptiness and infinite potential of the surrounding space remains always present. Such writing best represents the situation of thought as such in relation to the given world, the more elaborated, coloured and multimediated writing spaces literally and metaphorically screening out recognition of the void which penetrates all representations of knowledge, renders provisional all claims to truth, and signifies both the not-human and the open space of innovation beyond the scope of the encyclopedia on which thought can write.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The extraordinary flexibility of the writing space in the instance of narrative fiction is succinctly expressed in a reflection by the narrator of Richard Powers’ novel <i>Generosity</i>:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Time passes</i>, as the novelist says. The single most useful trick of fiction for our repair and refreshment: the defeat of time. A century of family saga and a ride up an elevator can take the same number of pages. Fiction sets up a conversion rate, then changes it in a syllable. The narrator’s mother carries her child up the stairs and the reader follows, for days. But World War I passes in a paragraph. I needed 125 pages to get from Labor Day to Christmas vacation. In six more words, here’s spring” (156).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Writing on the void foregrounds not the self-evident existence of the real and human dependence on it for knowledge, but the unlikeness of the material means available to formulate and represent what we can know to the material forms of the objects of our knowledge, including ourselves. Neither the objects of the given world nor poems are themselves knowledge, but provide objects to think with, and about and from which knowledge is derived. Hence human knowledge is a function of the expansive network of systems of signs collectively invented for objectifying it, the most limited being the most powerful metonymy for knowledge in the current phase of Western social and media evolution, the image.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The webscreen in contrast to the lettered page is a digital portal of the semiosphere, full of links away from what is immediately present, other potential foci of attention, other orderings of thought than the one in the foreground, a text displayed not as a cut from a whole in order to focus attention on a part as does the picture frame or the print page but a constant reminder of the many multimedial operations instantly available to disseminate a text in its present instantiation or transform it into something else. If the degree zero of the white sheet of paper as a writing space objectifies the thought of a singular mind distanced from immediate interaction with others, the networked computer or mobile phone screen as a writing space objectifies much more fully and vividly than could the newspaper as their print technology predecessor the temporal and narrative immediacy (“mindlife”) of the consciousness of socially, informationally and eventfully immersed minds. The two media forms continue the ancient oscillation between distance from the moment, and immersion in it, as modes of situating thought.</p>
<h4 class="sec2" id="s5.25"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-25">7.2 Writing Space – Reading</a></h4>
<p class="noindent1">A writing space is also a reading space, the text serving as the intermediary between minds and offering a reader the possibility and the means, depending on the reader’s fluency with the communicational apparatus employed by the writer, of absorbing for the time of reading another mind’s conceptual framing of the world. The reading as well as the writing process of engagement with the n-dimensional space mapped by a text is well described by Bolter (1991: 11): “In the act of writing, the writer […] enters into a reflective and reflexive relationship with the written page […] It becomes difficult to say where thinking ends and writing begins, where the mind ends and the writing space begins.” For both the writer and the reader, the mediating space of the text objectifies the “fictive activation” of thought, which includes the identities of both writer and reader as these are constituted by the text to support its claim to authority and value and to ensure its most productive reception. But acts of reading have this special obligation, that the reader should allow the text as a distinctive ordering of thought and experience to be mentally realised as much as possible in its integrity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In the form of the print book, the space of the page as a unit of meaning is permeable simply as a result of oscillations in attention as the eye is caught by words on the opposing page, the memory of previous pages reinserts them into the moment of reading, or associations with other sources of knowledge or personal experiences contribute to shaping the event of reading. Whatever the particular affordances of other media objects (a musical or other performance, a painting, a movie, radio, TV, or a web document framed by icons, sounds, advertisements, and links to other content), the same interaction between text, reader and media environment occurs. But for the text to fulfil its communicative purpose, it must for the time it occupies the attention of a reader/viewer order the reader’s subjectivity according to its particular construction of meaning, textual work which is most strongly challenged by the new media environments of the later twentieth century.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As Cook (1995: 50) writes of the effect of reading a poem, “The self is two selves, that of before the poem and that of after”; Badiou describes the same experience as “mental capture” (2005a: 44). Both identify a principal quality of this engagement with poetic writing, that the writing space which it occupies invades mental space and can modify the mental world and self of the reader in fundamental ways. The effect, personally and socially, may range from restoring or maintaining a steady state to revolutionary action, from an utterly imperceptible variation in thought or behaviour to epistemic/regime change at a global level. Life in society depends on our ability to imagine (“read”) the mind-worlds of other people, and much that is socially destructive derives from imaginative failure or the malign use of such knowledge. It also depends increasingly on openness to the possibility of new knowledge and acquiring the critical and reflective means of assessing and acting on it. Conventionally, this is what making sense means, in that it requires the imaginative ability to perceive the possible orderliness of a text which may not conform in any way to the learned and normalised framing of knowledge and experience which a reader brings to it. In the gap between the normalised and the possible lies choice and decision. It is in the dissonance between internalised and new orders and framings that, in this domain of discovery, “things onward and more remote” are to be found.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s5.26"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-26">8. FOUR Instances of the poem</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Sidney’s definition of the poetic as a modality of language emphasised the poet’s inventive intelligence as the source of the “fore-conceit” (Luhmann’s “intuition”) of the work which is realised in a narrative fiction because the Idea which it renders accessible cannot be perceived or understood by reference to the world as it is. In order for that Idea to have a transformative effect on that world, it must pass into and shape the thinking of readers who can locally enact a version of the fictional model of true and just action and so contribute to bringing the real world actually closer to the Idea. For Badiou (2013: 111-112), “living under the sign of the Idea” of the true life means living in a continuity with the past while being engaged in an always unfinished project. “We return in this way to the aim of ancient wisdom, taking up in our turn this quintessentially initial aspiration to a life that is not only marked by the Idea and by truth but by the idea of a fulfilled life, a life in which everything that could be experimented with, as far as truth is concerned, has been.” Experiments in living, and experiments in thought, come together under the sign of the poetic.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One: Philip K. Dick, <i>Eye in the Sky</i> (1957, rpt. New York: Vintage Books, 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Among other media forms which have developed since Sidney wrote his theory of poetry, novels clearly can be instances of the poem as he defines it. I will consider one example, Philip K. Dick’s <i>Eye in the Sky</i> (1957). The “fore-conceit” or motive of the novel is a question raised by social constructionism: if each of us lives in a reality which is collectively constructed, how do individual versions of that reality accommodate each other? This question is explored narratively through the transformative effect on a group of eight visitors to an advanced research facility in California in 1959 where a device called the Bevatron was being tested. Its purpose was to permit “advanced research into cosmic ray phenomena artificially generated within controlled conditions” (14). As a result of a failure in the proton beam deflector, the beam cut through and destroyed the observation platform, the visitors falling to the floor of the chamber containing a giant magnet and being seriously injured. Exploring the effect on the group of visitors of exposure to the intense magnetic field becomes the work of the narrative, enmeshed as it is in the politics of the cold war and the extreme public sensitivity in the United States to the threat of Communism.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Dick underpins the fictionality of his novel by locating its world just two years ahead of the real world of its publication date, so that for contemporary and informed readers (in the R&amp;D-based, military-industrial complex developing in California, anyway) the slippage between ordinary social reality and the fictional social reality of the novel as Dick’s realist writing represents it would be very slight. And this indistinction is critical to the novel’s principal theme, the relationship between the real world as such and the private worlds of each individual. After the accident, the eight visitors return to consciousness and their homes and find themselves in a perplexing, altered reality – “objectively the scene was prosaic, the usual scene from his bedroom window at nine-thirty on a cold October night” (31), but shadowed by “vague phantasmagoria” (39), leading some of the characters to the conclusion that “We’re going to have to work out the dynamics of this thing. This world, or whatever it is, has its own laws. Different laws from the ones we’re familiar with” (41). The systematic construction of this version of reality produces a world run according to the laws enforced by a severe divinity through actual divine intervention according to Old Testament practice. The characters actually experience these laws in operation, and conclude that they have become embedded in the world-view of one of their number. Altogether three such worlds are experienced as the characters try to find their way back to the prosaic and familiar social settings which are not totally ordered by any one subjective construction. The novel, in other words, engages the potentiality of the semiosphere as the world of diverse kinds of cultural knowledge, but here manifested in singular and totalitarian constructions of social reality by which one mind dominates all others. Each character’s personal world construction is a powerful mixture of prosaic, objective, everyday reality and the multiple possible worlds written into textual and cultural existence by human thought and intersubjectively shared in experience as knowledge, belief and practice by fractions of the members of modern societies. The novel explores the totalitarian potential of this power when singular, private worlds accrue the social power enabling their dominance. It is crucial to the novel’s narrative of discovery that, however totalising these singular worlds are, they do not abolish memory or knowledge of the existence of other possible worlds among the characters submitted to and governed by them.<sup><a id="note_27" href="#note27">27</a></sup></p>
<p class="fig" id="fig5.3"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/ill5.3.jpg" /></p>
<p class="imagecaption">Illustration 3:</p>
<p class="noindent1">Before taking these points any further, it is important to give attention to the materiality of the text of the novel as a writing space. Treating two pages of the novel (Illust X) as an object to be observed requires suspending literate competence and noticing the ordinary conventions of print media presentation. Dick’s pages are completely conventional; they contain their written language in print in the rectangular block of black letters located with geometrical precision within the larger white rectangle of the page, a long-established convention of page layout which is now also normalised in digital simulations of the page as a unit of textual organisation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If we start with the black letters, we have either mass locating space and giving it definition, or the void overwritten and populated by the letters and at the same time surrounding each letter and emphasising the authorial and social force required to give order to the linguistic signs and create meaningful relationships among them. Spatially, the geometrical order of the page of black type can be regarded as a systematic reduction of the spaces, masses, figures and tonalities of a black and white photograph, itself a sign and not a copy of a real, to the concepts and systems of iconic and tonal signs which render the photograph perceptible and thinkable. Unlike the photograph, but like the moving image, motion in time, space and subjectivity discursively traverses the space of the page as narration. Narrative seeks to give shape to space and trajectory to time; from this perspective, the repeated rectangular ordering of each narrative page signifies the power of authoring reason to create such an order out of the stuff of the given world, experience and inherited knowledge, the kind of order that rational perspective gives to/finds in the visible world and embodied in architecture, including in some places in the form of cities.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The diversity of signs organised page by page by the same rectangular frame and by the conventions of narrative discourse in print affirms that the relations between objects in space and time are or can be rationally ordered. It is also a fundamentally humanistic construction, a filling of the void of the world with meaning by the knowing action of bringing a new world into existence in writing. But one only needs to open Mark Danielewski’s <i>House of Leaves</i> to be reminded, as graphic novels also remind their readers when they disrupt the regular geometry of the traditional comic page, that the arrangement and display of signs on the space of a page typically exemplifies (but can also modify or contest) cultural conventions that socially and subjectively sustain established conceptions of real world order. In the dis-order of his page layout, Danielewski challenges the imposition of realist conventions on narration. In particular, the title metaphor for the book signifies the excess of thought over physical or objective reality through the discovery that the internal dimensions of the house in which much of the action of the novel takes place are larger than its exterior dimensions, a situation comparable to the relation of the space of the imagination to that occupied by the work of art, or the space of the semiosphere to that of the library.</p>

<p class="noindent1">At each moment in the writing, the effect of the freedom for thought available in fiction is obvious. From letter to letter, word to word, nothing is simply predictable, although everything can be anticipated by the reader, even if that anticipation has to be revised by what is actually written. Appreciating this fact about the writing requires reading to be slowed right down; normal reading, like the situation in the novel itself, assumes conventionality in world construction until that assumption cannot be sustained if sense is to be made. Furthermore, paragraphing serves to distinguish the direct discourse of characters’ voices and the narrator’s setting by indirect discourse of those voices in a shared time and place (with the narratorial privilege of full access to the minds of the characters) and to link them in a montage in which the forward movement of the narrative creates for the reader the imaginative illusion of a coherent reality and causes the encompassing presence of the void to disappear.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The gap in which we live, between the given world as such and truths as such, is signified by the unlikeness of the material means available to formulate and represent what we can know to the material forms of the objects of our knowledge, including ourselves. Knowledge is knowledge of, not from or in, the things known (apart from technological things, where knowledge is both in and of the thing). When looked at rather than read, or read as objects, words and other kinds of sign remain stubbornly themselves, representing what we know to ourselves in any one of many languages, composed together according to the formal rules of grammar and syntax developed over time for registering the complex dimensions of human experience in and of the given world and the worlds of culture.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The novel does what novelists have learned to do routinely, which is to enable the reader to shift perspective effortlessly within and without the mindlives of its characters, imaginatively seeing and knowing them as bodies, minds and selves in social space, in this case contrasting the assumption of an everyday, seamlessly real world which is the same for everyone with the way that world is differently composed and populated according to what an individual accepts or denies as being part of the apparently objective ordering of the real. The characters in the world of the narrative do not have the novelist’s capability, but have only our ordinary inferential access to each other’s minds. But the physical world external to them (reality), which they have in common, is taken to be full (the world as represented cinematically); each person’s private world, and the measure of its limitations or difference from the taken-for-granted, is represented as a subtraction from or modification of that fullness.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Many kinds of knowledge circulating in the California of the 1950s manifest themselves as the narrative takes shape, a crucial dimension of the work of imitation required to build a fictional post-World War II California. The knowledge each character possesses contributes to their difference from as well as their similarity to one another. But, critically, this knowledge is not referred to non-fictional sources outside the narrated world for its authority; it circulates in that world as an inherent factor in its constitution and functioning, the semiosphere of the 1950s being an invisible dimension of the social reality of that period as elements of it become present in the minds and conversation of its inhabitants. It is particularly important to note how much of the knowledge in the novel circulates in direct speech; it is not just knowledge, but it is “my knowledge”, identifying a person’s cultural, professional and social positioning. Its function is dialogic; each moment in the narrative typically requires characters to achieve provisional agreements resulting from argument and analysis in order to act collectively and be open to future possibilities, and so to reduce claims made on the basis of power or authority. But these dialogic processes are contained within the declarative frame of the person whose closed mindlife dominates the world in which the other characters are forced to live.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Between the two totalitarian poles represented by Wall Street and Communism exists the democratic middle, which is personified by the principal female character, accused of Communist sympathies because of her reading and public activities. She is dangerous because</p>
<p class="quote">She signs Party peace petitions and she reads the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. People like her – they’re more of a menace to Party discipline than any other bunch. The cult of individualism. The idealist with his own law, his own ethics. Refusing to accept authority. It undermines society. It topples the whole structure. Nothing lasting can be built on it (231).</p>
<p class="noindent1">The truth procedure of <i>Eye in the Sky</i> is its fictional invention in the generic form of the novel of a possible world, and its exploration of totalitarianism through an individual’s power to remake the real world by projecting their private mental world on to it and all other minds.<sup><a id="note_28" href="#note28">28</a></sup> The truths it makes accessible are for the reader to formulate in another textual mode, including the modes of philosophy, literary criticism, history, politics, sociology, anthropology, review, blog, email, or to translate into another medium, like film, setting in process another cycle of textual transmission, interpretation and knowledge creation.<sup><a id="note_29" href="#note29">29</a></sup> But it is important to emphasise that it is a distinguishing quality of the modern novel as a media form to engage within its fiction a panorama of the given, social and subjective worlds and to impose on its readers a responsibility akin to that sought by Sidney. As Luhmann describes the evolution of the novel, it “paved the way for the reflection of the distinction between fiction and reality within itself. Fictional texts were produced in such a way […] to present the reader with situations that called for <i>decisions</i>, by means of which he would individualize himself in ways that yield consequences” (2000: 282; emphasis in the original). From another perspective, the modern novel engages all four conditions of philosophy as Badiou defines them, as well as philosophy itself. Even the two pages of the illustration confirm this point; art, love, politics, and science are all written into the narrative of the novel because they delineate the primary modern dimensions of human thought and experience and their weaving together moment by moment is the basis of adaptive subject formation and shared cultural identities. To produce knowledge from the novel requires thinking the novel systematically through any one or combination of these categorical lenses, depending on the expertise of the reader, with the important corollary that making decisions is a critical part of forming knowledge from reading fiction. Continuing exposure to the possibility of being read is all that is needed for this text to do the work of a poem as Sidney defines it, and serve as the “ground plot for a profitable invention” (1973: 124).</p>
<p class="noindent1">I have approached <i>Eye in the Sky</i> as a singular example of a space given form by writing and a poem. It is important in the context of post-print multi-media technological evolution to identify the defining attributes of truth procedures in the domain of art independently of traditional genres as these have defined initially according to the affordances of orality and print technology and then by their extensions and displacements as each new medium offered other expressive possibilities to thought and representation. The common ground in respect of the claims I am making is to be found in Badiou’s characterisation of novelistic prose as “an art of redoubtable, abstract complexity” (2008: 180), or Luhmann’s statement that “The work of art is an ostentatiously improbable occurrence” (2000: 153), or Bernstein’s concept of the “difficult” poem; all take as a foundational criterion for generating events in thought of a potentially transformative kind the use of the full resources of a fictional medium, because it is with those resources fully engaged that the complex potentiality of human thought can be actualised.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Two: A R Ammons, “Retiring”, <i>Lake Effect Country</i> (New York and London: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1983), 12.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A R Ammon’s “Retiring” is the nearest of the texts which I am considering here to the traditional visual and formal conception of a poem. It can be defined as a lyric, it is composed of four groups of words which can be described as stanzas, it is precisely placed in the space of the page beneath a title word, and its use of a serif font, two font sizes distinguishing the title and body of the text, word spacing and short lines together create an aesthetic effect of calm and orderly reflection. As with Gass’s reading of the statue, the poem’s being fully contained in the otherwise empty space of the page and completed by a full stop refers the reader’s eye back into and through it, restraining the onward pull of the flow of discourse and reading and the invitation to move directly to a new poem on the next page of the opening. The poem comes into existence between the void and the complexity of the language system, which is always evolving.</p>
<p class="fig" id="fig5.5"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/ill5.5.jpg" /></p>
<p class="imagecaption">Illustration 5:</p>
<p class="noindent1">What does the writing space in which this poem is inscribed signify, given that on this page the interaction of void and letter typically involves the much fuller presence of the void separating words and letters in contrast to the ordering of space, time and consciousness asserted by the double rectangle of page and type constituting the conventional page of prose narrative? The pressure and density of things and relationships in social reality which fills the type space of the novel page is subtracted from the writing space generated by the lyric, just as the position created for the reader is less one of observer and more one of participant. The poem foregrounds and objectifies the abstract and virtual space of culture and subjectivity (“the experiences of consciousness” (Badiou, 2005b: 67) which distinguish the poem from mathematical thinking) as it is configured by the two-dimensional space of the page and the n-dimensional spaces of language and of the human mind and its flows of thought. By being immersed in so much white space, its words are perceived as objects made visible by a light without colour which casts no shadows, the light of the world of the semiosphere; there is no mystery about them taken individually, but together they compose a unique object creating a unique event in thought for each reader. The mystery resides in the meanings they generate and accumulate from their sequential and recursive interaction with the meanings of those words already available to the mind of a particular reader, and their release from any specific placing in the given world, as it is or as it can be imagined.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This mystery locates a fundamental difference in modern thinking which goes to the heart of claims for a new humanities. As Nagel (2012: 13-14) puts the difference, “there are doubts about whether the reality of such features of our world as consciousness, intentionality, meaning, purpose, thought, and value can be accommodated in a universe consisting at the most basic level only of physical facts […] to those who doubt the adequacy of such a world view, the different attempts to accommodate within it mind and related phenomena all appear as attempts to reduce the true extent of reality to a common basis that is not rich enough for the purpose.” To go with the poem as constituting a mental event or “experience of consciousness” is to allow one’s mindlife to be progressively modified, first by the title word’s appearance in the space of the page to name the poem, and then by the subject position, ‘I’, which anchors the words. The poem evokes the presence of a subject of thought thinking and hence invites the reader to imitate that thought process, to become that thought, for the duration of the moment measured by the interaction of a specific reader’s apprehension of the words as it emerges through following the temporal flow of the writing in the time of reading and the mental spaciousness generated by the writing. But the reader can choose how to become a subject of the poem by adopting one or more of the familiar positions socially available to respondents in acts of communication: identification, becoming the “I” of the poem for the time of reading; objecification, observing the “I” as an other and remaining detached; dialogically, by imagining an exchange with the poem’s imagined speaker.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Each position alters the possible meanings of the poem. The title itself introduces at least a double orientation, because “retiring” can signify “unassertive”, disclaiming a position of power or authority, and “withdrawing from”, leaving a stage of life behind, a revisioning of identity. Each phase of the poem is initiated by “I’ll” and defines an intentional orientation of consciousness towards the world outside the mind. This “fictive activitation” of a set of desired and imagined future actions includes the expansion of consciousness into ever-vaster domains of the universe and a recognition in the last phase that the work proposed may not be achievable. The expanding horizon of the poem follows the steps to knowledge and power over the given world, from observation to naming and assimilating. Watching is not passive, but leads to categorising and ordering of what is observed; bringing what is observed into knowledge requires naming, but the achievement of ever-finer discriminations includes the acknowledgment that the given world escapes capture by those names and is indifferent to them; bringing the otherness of the given world into knowledge offers a vision of full integration between mind, self and world, but achieving that vision may not be either attempted or accomplished.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Is the poem expressing a desire for human control over nature, or does it express a hope that there might be an integral link between the processes by which the universe keeps “going right” and the ability of human thought to comprehend those processes correctly and work in harmony with them? Does it propose that human consciousness is essential to the universe (either as part of the essence of, or necessary to) or does it merely found a collective delusion of power and control over the given world? Does language add anything to or reveal anything about what already is? Does thought give access to what is, or only reveal humanity’s immersion in its own self-serving constructions? Every reading of the poem will in one way or another, explicitly or implicitly, address these questions. The work of the poem as a truth procedure is to create an event in thought which generates such questions and to require a decision on the part of a reader about them. That decision will not finally determine what the poem means but, if disseminated, will contribute to humanity’s on-going search for knowledge and understanding of its relation to the rest of the universe.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I referred earlier to the reader’s awareness of the next poem in the collection. However carefully one might try to exclude it, one cannot avoid awareness of it as one’s eye leaps the space between the poems, apprehends echoes and continuities in words and phrases, in effect draws the other poem into one’s reading. This experience makes explicit what happens as the line endings hover on the edge of the void of the page as the eye pauses before returning to find the first letter of the next line and maintain the flow of thought or begin a new phase in its development. At each moment in reading, memory of what has been read informs the reader’s anticipation of what is yet to be read, but is also revised and modified as the unique and provisional coherence of any poem asserts itself in relation to the others comprising the collection. The emptiness given body by the words is also full of the potential for knowing and meaning, an “invisible, intangible swarming” (Borges, 1971: 52) generated by the intratextual relations among the poems and their “outside”, the infinite of the semiosphere as it is invoked by the interaction between the text and the reader’s stored knowledge and experience.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Such poems (but all artworks) affirm a reciprocal relation between the given world and embodied minds, but one in which the world as such when given to consciousness and thought becomes immersed in situated experience and a personal version of humanity’s accumulated knowledge. From this relation, which is also a translation of the given world as such into human means of sense-making, emerge artworks, the unique and momentary forms thought can take in various media. Latour (2004: 85) in a quite different context (wine-tasting) provides a very pertinent way of thinking about what matters here: “reality grows to precisely the same extent as the work done to become sensitive to differences. The more instruments proliferate, the more the arrangement is artificial, the more capable we become of registering worlds. Artifice and reality are in the same positive column, whereas something entirely different from work is inscribed on the debit side: what we have there now is <i>insensitivity</i>” (emphasis in the original). Crucially, the effect of completing a work is not determinative of the thought it initiates; as Luhmann writes (2000: 25), “What is at stake is not a problem to be solved once and for all but a provocation – the provocation of a search for meaning that is constrained by the work of art without necessarily being determined in its results. In the beginning, there is a difference […]”, generated for no reason that matters (except in retrospect) because what emerges from that initial difference cannot be predicted. To follow “no law but wit” is to enter the possibilities of thought as such for understanding the truths of our world.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Three: Dinah Hawken, “The Brain and the Leaf”, in <i>One Shapely Thing – poems &amp; journals.</i> Wellington: Victoria University Press, 2006, 62-74.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A good example of a beginning which does not predict what emerges from it is “First I see a single leaf./ Light, veined, shapely, green”, which inaugurates Dinah Hawken’s poem, “The Brain and the Leaf”.<sup><a id="note_30" href="#note30">30</a></sup> This “self-creating difference” (see above 3.3.1.1, 3.3.1.3) opens into a meditation on seeing imaginatively, both the world outside the mind and the brain which makes that world accessible to consciousness and knowledge being apprehended as recollections of what was once actually seen. The poem contrasts the scientific study of vision, determining what is characteristic of any brain, with observing the experience of seeing in “the way <i>my</i> brain/is capable”; a “kind of dreamy scanning” gives greater clarity in some circumstances than “looking in a focussed way.” The poem enacts this quality of consciousness by the ways its words condense into lines and repeated two-line stanza-like units which gather thoughts into possible meanings without building a narrative or argumentative order. Instead, the experience of reading is one of momentary adjustments of awareness; the two-line units pause, or flow, shift perspective and attention, return to a previous thought in a different context, marking out a distinctive and abductive process of sense-making in the space of the page. In Badiou’s terms, “the poem is an operation, it is also an event. The poem takes place. […] It offers us a taking place in language” (2005: 29).</p>

<p class="noindent1">The poem affirms a mutual relation of dependence; perpetuated in imagination and unbound from the simply real,</p>
<p class="quote">The leaf has taken a life<br />
in my mind defying gravity:</p>
<p class="noindent1">and it is there, held by the brain and the poem, “to help us to live”. Both brain and poem mediate between the world as such and perception and consciousness of that world; both together offer the possibility of intersecting bodily experience and sensation through imagination with meanings and values. There is one further clarification of what is at stake in this necessary action of imagination towards the given world, exemplified by the imagined leaf. To “save it and be saved”, the last line of the poem, is motivated by a recognition early in the poem that</p>
<p class="quote">I realise I have fallen in love<br />
with the imagined leaf.</p>
<p class="noindent1">From its inaugural moment the thought of the poem reveals to the poet and her reader what the imagined brain cannot, which is what <i>her</i> brain is capable of thinking and the complex of ways it uniquely, humanly, links the object world through imagination and love to the perceiving and embodied “I”.<sup><a id="note_31" href="#note31">31</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent1">Four: Jorie Graham, <i>Swarm</i>. New York: The Ecco Press, 2000.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The sequence of steps I am following here is simply stated: in each instance of “the poem”, the writing space is progressively more emptied out of language, and the structural relations among the words are progressively more deeply fractured. The full page of realistically observed and narrated social reality from <i>Eye in the</i> Sky creates a stable perspective for the reader on a doubled reality, that which is collectively shared and is the foundation of common sense in the world imagined by the novel, and that which is a private version of the “same” world imposed by one character on the other characters which they apprehend by observing changes in their world as they have previously known/thought it. The two lyrics initiate thinking about interactions between the given world and the conscious I, exploring how the object world becomes incorporated in the mind while remaining itself and engaging the reader in the thought which emerges from reflecting on that incorporation. Now, in this last example, the reader encounters a mode of writing in which disconnection and disruption in every dimension of the relations of consciousness and world as these can be mapped by language is predominant.</p>
<p class="noindent1">I will consider one poem, “Underneath (13)”, [illust 3], a glance at which immediately evidences this disruption, which is integral to the volume as a whole. <i>Swarm</i>, the title of the collection, signifies a gathering and a departure without a predetermined place of arrival, a state of affairs which is manifested at the level of the volume as a whole by the arrangement of individual poems. Of the total of 36, 16 are entitled “Underneath”; of the 16, 8 are distinguished by bracketed names, and 8 by bracketed numbers, from 1-13, among which 4-6, 10, and 12 are missing. These poems are distributed among the others, but not in numerical order. The implication, confirmed by specific poems, is that the collection does not encourage the construction of a narrative ordering of the poems; this kind of sense-making is not on offer. Paragraphs and stanzas in the conventional sense of organised units of meaning have disappeared, to be replaced, in this poem (but not in every poem in the collection), by single lines which seem to achieve as much coherence in thought at any moment as it is possible to achieve, and many of those lines are broken by gaps.</p>
<p class="fig" id="fig5.7"><img alt="illustration" src="../images/ill5.7.jpg" /></p>
<p class="imagecaption">Illustration 7:</p>
<p class="noindent1">What is at stake here? If we recollect Barthes’ definition of a professor as one who finishes his sentences (1976: 50) so that the sentence signifies the ability to find in or impose on experience a rational and authoritative order and so constitute knowledge, then it becomes apparent that the “voice” of the poems is neither constituting such a subject position for itself or the reader, nor assuming that any of the inherited structurings of experience as these have sedimented into the grammatical, syntactical and generic forms of linguistic expression and collective knowledge can be used without question as a ground for thought. The two words of the opening line of the poem, “needed explanation”, locate immediately both the becoming conscious of a motive for beginning a process of thinking, in a state of need without an acknowledged origin, and then a focussing of that need after a pause on to a problem in knowledge. Or, they can be read as signifying a conversation which just at that moment becomes audible, either to a third person or because the private flowing of mindlife at this moment becomes speech and so can be attended to by a second person (we, us, our, you, yr, your) even though all the words originate with “my voice” and the other is offered words to speak.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The poem’s coordinates are defined by the opening and closing lines: need seeking understanding across a gap of silence and emptiness, in the opening line; and the closing, the affirmation “We exist Meet me”, which acknowledges a fundamental human fact, “the body the foundation” for knowledge of the world, self, and the personal existence of others, but also seeks beyond the fact of existence (in a request which could also be a plea) a form of relationship between “We” and “me” in which embodied persons meet in their bodies and offer each other reciprocal recognition. Here, it is the poem’s speaker who is thinking the possibility of this recognition, not claiming that the other person comprising the “We” has committed to meeting. The gap in the line both recognises that the conceptualised relationship is being imagined, and is not (yet) a fact, and that between the two bodies there exists a void which only a decision on the part of the other person can bridge.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The line “intensification void” indicates the parameters between which the work of the poem oscillates: gaps, line endings, all the white space of the page as a contemporary cave wall on which to write; words like “nothingness”, “alone”, and “<i>annihilation</i>”, make present at every moment of reading the poem the imminent dissolution of meaning and self; intensification is evidenced in the fragments of words and phrases which range over many dimensions of the thinkable as instances of the pressure of thought and attention needed to resist the void and the implications of being alone, and of the truth of the axiomatic line, “the human being and the world cannot be equated”. The idea of the loving relationship as the conserver of one’s existence (“touch me (here)”), identity (“my archive”) and the ground of history in memory locates their incommensurability.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The poem instantiates aporetic space, that which is underneath “collective belief” and “at the bottom below the word”, a space of consciousness in which “the tools that paved the way” are no use but “there is nothing wrong with the instrument” of the poem. What is accomplished is the simultaneous recognition and enactment of thought’s self-construction and its tentativeness in settling on a specific pattern or structure of relations; there is not one narrative but many possible histories and theories which do not provide any decisive clue to the future. In their place is the event of the poem’s thought, achieved by entering the world and history in the written body of the poem and the mind of a reader through the writing, which “give[s] birth to a single idea” by means of “my voice”. The volume as a whole is an instance of the energy of thought constituting the semiosphere; the repetition of words heading different elaborations of thought creates an intratextuality for the book, while each poem stands as an object in its own right – even if the rational ordering of thought signified by stanza forms is almost entirely suspended, the objectness of each poem remains. References to other writers open any poem beyond the physical boundaries of the book into the cultural inventories of the poet and her readers.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The mental work of the reader is thus critical as the place where the birth of the idea generated by the poem may be experienced. If there are “so many messages transmitted they will never acquire meaning”, neither an eventful encounter between this poem and a reader, nor the achievement of new knowledge, can be predicted. The process whereby truths may be identified from an engagement with the poem as a thought is not authoritatively determined or policed, but remains embedded in the flows of discourse which constitute a society and the semiosphere of which the poem becomes a part once published. “Swarm”, in this context, becomes a metaphor for thought coming into provisional definition from the chaos of the language system. Any singular reading will condense possibilities of meaning from the poem; in a poem as freely ranging over vast territories of thought and awareness, space and time as “Underneath (13)”, offering no closure but only openings on to what may be possible, the singular readings will accumulate over time, interact, perhaps modify “collective belief”, perhaps confirm that the poem’s enquiry into love as the sign of the difference the human makes in the world, or intensity of thought as the means to withhold the pressure of the void, are truths of human existence.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A more formal example of reading from the work of professional readers is pertinent here. Two essays on <i>Swarm</i> by Klink (2005) and Yenser (2005) are reprinted in <i>Jorie Graham. Essays on the Poetry</i>, edited by Thomas Gardner. While they agree on the difficulty of the poems in this collection, they also proceed to provide well argued analyses of them, including the larger context of her previous publications. The academic knowledge work exemplified in these two essays demonstrates the formal process of creating knowledge from the thought of the poem. It is not that the prose of argument in the interpretive essay re-presents the fragmentary and elusive writing of the poem as the definitive statements which it conceals or obfuscates. Instead, the different priorities in thought, literacies and experiences of these expert readers are objectified through their engagements with the poem, and their essays are the thoughtful outcome or record of that engagement. Not, therefore, stating what the poem really intended to say but did not, but making a case according to the formal conventions of academic literary critical discourse for thinking the meaning of the poem as an object of knowledge in a particular way. The poem’s words remain visible in quotation, signifying their displacement by acts of analysis and interpretation, which are also acts of translation. Neither essay is definitive concerning the “true meaning” of the poem; each essay modifies the possibilities for meaning and hence extends the ways in which the archive of the semiosphere is refreshed and reviewed and the possibilities for thought are extended and multiplied. This process cannot result in the discovery of a final, formal proof of the truth of the poem’s thought, but that thought carried into the minds of others can produce what Badiou claimed for philosophy, “a diagnosis of the epoch” (2013: 130) and collective agreements on new understandings of the given world and the true life. The work of the poem is to make new thought possible, through the intersection of its condensation from the system of linguistic signs and generic forms with the unique mind/person of any reader in the void of the page/screen. Reading “Underneath (13)”, and then reading Klink’s discussion of it (2005: 165-167) and Yenser’s discussion of the group of poems with that title (2005: 162-163) demonstrates unequivocally how interpretation is focussed by the instrument of the poem, but is not constrained by a single, authoritative body of knowledge. It is inter- and intra-textual, just as Graham’s poems are, and contextual to the time and place of reading and writing; it is productive of knowledge, but knowledge resulting from explorations driven by singular minds affirming their singularity and ultimately seeking answers to the question, what does it mean to be human?</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s5.27"><a href="05_ST_TOCs.xhtml#s5-27">9. Conclusion</a></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The <i>logos</i> in fact never speaks in a clear voice: it looks for words, it hesitates, it stammers, it <i>starts over</i>” (Latour 2004:183; author’s emphasis). If this statement seems to apply most immediately to Graham’s poem, it nonetheless goes to the core of my argument about the relation of mutual dependency between the work of art and the work of creating new knowledge in the humanities in postmodernity.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This chapter has aimed at identifying a modality of writing which is fundamental to the claim that the humanities are a powerful means, complementary to the sciences, for the creation of new knowledge. It attempts to bring into the foreground a structure in the relation between thought and knowledge which is constituted by the singular mind, written language as sign and medium, and the objectification of thought as fiction. The four instances of “the poem” which I have discussed can be said to converge on one fundamental problem, which they offer ways of bringing to thought but to which they offer no definitive solution: what occurs at the experiential intersection of the singular mind, other minds, the given world, the collectivity of knowledge, and the void surrounding that collectivity and how can such occurrences open humanity to new knowledge and the possibility of truths? This intersection locates the critical origin of new humanistic knowledge in an event which is not self-explanatory or simply determinative of the knowledge which an encounter with it can generate. The exemplary event is the work of art, most fully situated by the poem.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rather than attempt to provide definitive interpretations of each poem in the preceding section, I have sought to emphasise the way in which each text establishes the ground of its thinking about humanity by positioning a reader’s mind in relation to some part of the spectrum of knowledge identified by Badiou’s four conditions of philosophy – politics, science, art and love – and some aspect of living in the world as it is given to us and made by us. Each poem provides an incentive to think more and differently; what the consequences of that responsive thinking might be cannot be predicted by the poem or its writer, even if the poem is making substantive claims about the kinds of thinking it is seeking to encourage or inculcate.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The point of aesthetic texts, one might say, is to perform exactly the opposite function to that performed by scientific texts, that is, rather than erasing any trace of “the person” in the process of formulating knowledge, to insist that the problem of knowing the world can be as well approached through the inclusion of the apprehending and experiencing singular person/embodied mind in the process of acquiring and formulating thought and knowledge. But the poem, in Graham’s term, is an “instrument”, just like scientific instruments, in providing access to dimensions of the world and ourselves which are inaccessible to ordinary sense experience and collective knowledge. A compelling example of this comparison would be the Great Hadron Collider, both the immensity (and cost, borne by society) of the machine in comparison to the immensity (and cost, borne by the poet) of the poem. It is tempting to think together the invisible dark matter filling the void of the universe and the invisible semiotic matter potentially present as a result of the embeddedness of any text in the Text<sup><a id="note_32" href="#note32">32</a></sup> of the semiosphere and the web of meanings attaching to that text in the moment of encounter with it which are specific to a particular reader. It is thought, memory, reading and writing which make this massive invisibility accessible and give it form. As I have affirmed, aesthetic texts are always already fully in culture but also open on to the void into which culture continually expands and in which humanity, for better and worse, discovers more of itself.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For Badiou and for Nagel it is axiomatic that there are intrinsic links between the system of nature and the system of language, so that thought objectified in the contrasted forms of the matheme and the poem is a competent means of discovering or inventing possible truths about ourselves and the world we live in. A discovery process founded on “no law but wit” and on axioms which initiate thought about what is conceivable rather than what is already known is a truly creative process.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If mathematics is our most abstract means of writing by which the physical universe becomes accessible to thought as such, a symbolic means which requires translation (like the poem) in order for its thought to become available to knowledge and to circulate through society over extended periods of time, so the (difficult) poem is our most abstract means of rethinking and remaking the knowledge accumulated in the subjective and collective universe of human experience and memory. It is the poem which, from its mysterious origin in a singular human mind, repeatedly opens towards possible answers to the question, what does it mean to be human?, a question which has multiple answers, and invokes the possibility of multiple truths. It is in the multiple, signified by the double positioning of thought in the attitude of the fictive “what if?” and in an open and democratic politics of equality to come, that the possibility of creative, non-deterministic change based on collective and accumulated knowledge exists. The four poems are inherently political, in whatever ways they constitute in writing relations between human and non-human, self and other, power and love, fact and value, times and places, the known and the yet-to-be known. Milton made the point a long time ago that form in the writing of poetry has an inherently political meaning and effect, one dimension of the acts of choice and decision required to compose a poem. In a preface to <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Milton argued that rhyme is not essential to poetry; instead, the blank verse in which his poem is composed should “be esteemed to be an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern bondage of rhyming” (1971: 39).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sidney conceives of poetry as a techné of civilisation, a medium and mode of communication which makes available to other minds the truth-revealing thought of a singular mind located in a specific time and place. That thought, transcending the boundaries of any knowledge system or discipline, is authorised by nothing more than the singular creative intellectual action claimed by Sidney to be the distinctive attribute of the poet. For Sidney, the poet reaches mentally outside existing knowledge and into ideality; but this “outside” might just as well be projected forward, as Derrida places the human knowledge project under the aegis of the emergent, the “to-come”, or Badiou under the aegis of the infinite. As a work of art, it has no correlative – however categorisable, it exists as a unique object in the semiosphere until it is engaged through reading by a unique mind. It becomes a generator of meaning and knowledge when the effects of reading are communicated, the most basic mode being paraphrase or commentary, the poem translated into ordinary (prose) language. These forms of writing are not the poem itself, just as real world objects do not mean by themselves but have meaning attributed to them when they are brought into language. As Luhmann (2000a: 294; emphasis in the original) observes, art “depends on a supplementary <i>linguistic</i> mediation of its meaning.” It is at this point that the humanities come into existence, engaged not only with works of art as events, but with all the kinds of events which humanity generates and which are productive of knowledge.</p>

Two statements made here locate the issues at the opposite pole to my argument for the humanities based on the singularity of each human mind. Firstly, XLI states that “all perceptions, both of sense and mind, are relative to man, not to the universe. The human understanding is like an uneven mirror receiving rays from things and merging its own nature with the nature of things, which thus distorts and corrupts it”; XLII states that “each man has a kind of individual cave or cavern which fragments and distorts the light of nature. This may happen either because of the unique and particular nature of each man: or because of his upbringing and the company he keeps; or because of his reading of books and the authority of those whom he respects and admires; or because of the different impressions things make on different minds, preoccupied and prejudiced perhaps, or calm and detached, and so on. The evident consequence is that the human spirit (in its different dispositions in different men) is a variable thing, quite irregular, almost haphazard” (2000: 41).</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note17" href="#note_17">17</a></sup> For Badiou, philosophy’s relation to politics is obversive. He writes that “In politics, thinking searches within a situation for a possibility <i>that the dominant state of things does not allow to be seen</i>. For example: today, in Europe as elsewhere, the state of things is the market economy, competition, the private sector, the taste for money, familial comfort, parliamentary elections, etc. A genuine political thinking will attempt to find a possibility which is <i>not</i> homogeneous with this state of things” (2005b: 62: emphasis in the original).</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note18" href="#note_18">18</a></sup> Badiou (2006: 149): “I call ʻencyclopediaʻ the general system of predicative knowledge internal to a situation: i.e. what everyone knows about politics, sexual difference, culture, art, technology, etc.“</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note19" href="#note_19">19</a></sup> Badiou’s approach seems to omit consideration of the multiplicity of paths offered by different media technologies for the transmission of thought through a society. A good local example, Giovanni Tiso’s blog [<a href="http://bat-bean-beam.blogspot.co.nz/">http://bat-bean-beam.blogspot.co.nz/</a>], makes possible exactly what Badiou looks for when he seeks a form of communication which encourages reflection, deliberation, the perception of pattern, the experience of coherence, demonstrating how new media can generate subjects of thought rather than overwhelm them with incoherent sensation and spectacle.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note20" href="#note_20">20</a></sup> Another writer who has gone deeply into the matter of mathematics as writing is Brian Rotman. His work, based in semiotics, is highly relevant to this discussion, as it is to thinking about the humanities. He presents mathematics as an “ongoing cultural endeavour”; both as “always part of the larger and open-ended human initiative of constant becoming – an enterprise never free from choice, contingency, the limits of our (always material) resources, and the arbitrariness of history” (2000: 3, 123-124), and as exemplifying “the norms and guidelines of the ‘rational’ – that is, the valid argument, definitional clarity, coherent thought, lucid explanation, unambiguous expression, logical transparency, objective reasoning – are located in their most extreme, focused, and highly cultivated form in mathematics” (1). He writes that “mathematics is a form of graphism, an inscriptional practice based on a system of <i>writing</i>. But more than a system, it is a <i>language</i> whose symbols, figures, notations, graphs, diagrams, equations, and metadiscursive devices are manipulated according to procedures that depend on and mediate meanings attached to them. . . . mathematical signs do not record or code or transcribe any language prior to themselves” (44: emphasis in the original). He argues, “in a direction familiar to those in the humanities”, that “rigor is not an externally enforced program of foundational hygiene, but rather an intrinsic and inescapable demand proceeding from writing: it lies within the rules, conventions, dictates, protocols, and such that control mathematical imagination and transform mathematical intuition into an intersubjective writing/thinking practice” (2000: 58). He compares mathematics with literature in the respect that each “conjures invisible proxies and identificatory surrogates of ourselves out of writing” (1995: 410). For mathematics, “the imagined scenario is a world conjured into being through written signs, and the thing being mathematically tested is a written statement, which, on this view, becomes a prediction about the mathematician’s future encounters with signs. In other words, mathematics is a rigorous inscriptional fantasy: the insistence on writing determining what can be legitimately imagined, and the ongoing process of imagining controlling what the mathematician can meaningfully and usefully write down” (2000: 122).</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note23" href="#note_23">23</a></sup> Badiou explains more fully that what is involved in attending to any new form, using music as an example, is “a protocol of incorporation (as for all the other - scientific, political or amorous – types of subjects:): those who listen to the work, or attempt to listen to it, will have to transform their individuality, their relation to art and their particular way of listening. Incorporation within a subjectivity consists in this transformation. […] music’s creation of its listeners takes time” 2013: 70).</p>

Porkoli demonstrates that Milton’s poetry persistently generates a demand for decision, the outcome of which is productive of new knowledge (of self, society, the world) if it involves a reaching beyond the repetition of conventions and rules by placing the reader in an aporetic mental space beyond the boundaries of the already known, which is also that space otherwise named the future.</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a id="note26" href="#note_26">26</a></sup> Badiou (2005b: 41) wries that “we live in a vulnerable, precarious world. […] We must not allow the global acceptance of the themes of liberal economy and representative democracy to dissimulate the fact that the world the twentieth century has given birth to is a violent and fragile world. […] We need a philosophy open to the irreducible singularity of what happens.”</p>
