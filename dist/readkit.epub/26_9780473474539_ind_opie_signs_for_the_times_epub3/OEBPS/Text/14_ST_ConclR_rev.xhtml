<p class="imagecaption">Marian Maguire, “James K. Baxter and Odysseus explore the Upper Whanganui” (2010)</p>
</div>
<p>This etching links my claims for the poem to the conclusion’s epigraph and to the figure of exploration in the title page illustration to Bacon’s <i>Instauratio Magna</i> in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a>. It brings together the local and the global in a striking fiction, that the poet James K. Baxter could be engaged in exploring the Whanganui River in a canoe in which Odysseus is his companion and is leading the way. Maguire has imagined a fundamental conjunction at which the humanities find their origin as a means of giving discursive form to human experience in time, place and culture: the generativity of the poem as a means of exploration into the unknown, the reading together of past and present, a shared human purpose, cultural difference and the singularities of person and place.</p>
<p>The problematic addressed in this study was generated from attempting to engage knowledge in the humanities with the work of government. At a time of intensive promotion of the concept of the information or knowledge society, it became critical to be able to answer the questions, What is the value of the humanities in government and for society?, and, Can the humanities claim to be a source of innovation? Since both of these questions had to be asked and answered in a context of government thinking, in which “the economy” provided the framing for both question and answer, one response from within the humanities began with a denial that such questions, framed in this way, should or could be answered. The value of uselessness was opposed to the values of a utilitarian culture. Such an argument affirmed that “the humanities” were an established and self-sufficient body of socially and culturally valuable knowledge with its own imperatives, methods and interests, however marginal they seemed to the knowledge interests of the democratic state and the holders of financial and social power, and not least those who governed universities.</p>
<p>In the opening chapter’s brief narrative of the rise and disappearance of a national organisation to represent the humanities in Aotearoa New Zealand, the process of trying to articulate a different answer which would be audible to government (and to those professing the humanities in universities and society at large) made it clear that it was not only government’s mind which needed to be changed, but that the current traditional conception of the humanities was inadequate to the task. The fact that no agency of the New Zealand government held a specific mandate to advance the humanities in government, in contrast to the position of the sciences, highlighted the distance in thinking which had to be covered if a successful case for the recognition of “the humanities” as a socially and economically valuable body of knowledge were to be made.</p>
<p>This book addresses the implications of the thinking done in the name of the Humanities Society of New Zealand (HUMANZ), a site for thought and practice positioned outside the institutional location of the academic humanities in the universities. Since the 1990s and 2000s were a period of fundamental challenge to those speaking for the humanities in democratic societies everywhere, but especially in Anglo-America where the tenets of neoliberalism were most vigorously transforming conceptions of government, society, and knowledge of value, those of us in New Zealand engaged with these issues found ourselves in significant company. Much of the work we did was assisted by the work of others, in Australia, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. But that work could travel only so far from its specific cultural and institutional origins; the difference of New Zealand’s positioning in these deep global transformations, not least because of the post-colonial review of relations between indigenous and settler populations being carried out by means of the Treaty of Waitangi, had also to be understood. It was in this context that the importance of thinking of humanistic knowledge as local in origin and enmeshed in culture, in contrast to the universalism of scientific knowledge, was decisively confirmed.</p>
<p>Given the hegemony of techno-science in Western democracies, broadly speaking two approaches to the problem of the humanities in relation to the state were available (putting the status quo to one side). Either: reframe the humanities as the human sciences, following European practice, and so deal at least rhetorically with the lack of fit between the social sciences and the humanities and the former’s claim to be of direct value to government in the management of the economy and society; or: challenge the current settlement in which the role of government is primarily economic, and seek to open up an alternative conception, which would relocate the discussion of the relation between government and the humanities. The second option, requiring new thinking about both government and humanistic knowledge, was both less practical and more utopian, but it did open a space for thinking which the former option did not.</p>
<p>Of course, the practical work of opening this space, as recounted in <a href="09_ST_CHR1.xhtml#ch1">Chapter One</a>, was largely determined by opportunities provided by government policy development, that is, it was opportunistic rather than driven by a grand plan. In retrospect, it becomes easy to perceive how superficial continuities are maintained by the recycling of key terms and concepts, like “knowledge society”, in government policy statements over time, even while those terms are being re-purposed as political imperatives shift and change. It is only in the writing of this book that the implications of that work have been able to be reflected upon and some conclusions drawn.</p>
<p><a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapters Two</a> to <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Five</a> explore the effect of adopting a conception of the democratic state and its responsibilities more in tune with the character and social functions of knowledge created in the humanities. It was striking to observe how little purchase “the humanities” had (and have) on government policies for knowledge and how marginal were the academic humanities in New Zealand universities, the only institutional site continuing to maintain those disciplines traditionally gathered together as the humanities at the most advanced level of knowledge work. There was no account in government policy of what happened to this dimension of academic knowledge when it left the university in the minds of those who studied it but did not stay in the university to be the means of its formal reproduction. I have referred to this form of humanities knowledge, eclectic, principled, value-laden, locally and culturally inflected, publicly shared and disseminated in diverse social contexts, as humanistic knowledge. Distinguishing between the advanced intellectual work of academic humanists and the myriad ways in which that work is transformed by and applied to social living exposes the situations in which academic humanities knowledge is tested and critiqued in singular, experimental acts of moral choice and decision. And the results of this testing by living flow back into academic humanities because humanists live in both spheres and participate in the manifold conversations through which knowledge of all kinds is disseminated and modified in society.</p>
<p>A constraining factor in developing an understanding of government from the perspective of the humanities was the immediate context motivating official thought and action. The ideological movement named variously as neoliberalism or neoconservatism provided the principal conceptual means for rethinking the role of government in society in the later decades of the twentieth century; its dominance was magnified by startlingly rapid developments in computing and communications technologies. Together, these sociocultural forces impelled the globalisation of techno-scientific knowledge, business and the movement of money, generating conceptions of a fourth industrial revolution based on these new technologies and the knowledge they made accessible for the creation of economic value. Hence the information and then the knowledge society and its correlative, innovation, became the determinants of thinking in the policy domain. The humanities, to be visible and audible in that domain, had to find a way of speaking about themselves in those terms.</p>
<p>The main themes deriving from the work done under the aegis of HUMANZ can be summarised as: a theory adequate to what is and should be distinctive about academic humanities knowledge and the work it does in and for society in postmodernity; a conception of the state which follows from this theory and enables humanists to address the state and be heard; a re-orientation of the state’s policy work which follows from this conception of the state and its role in a democratic society; and an account of the sources from which a new humanities can claim to produce new knowledge in academic and general public contexts which is innovative and a force for social and cultural evolution.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s6.1">6.1 Knowing humanistically</h3>
<p>The analysis offered in <a href="10_ST_CHR2.xhtml#ch2">Chapter Two</a> entrenches a version of the “two cultures” hypothesis, not as a competitive contest for dominance and mutual exclusion, but as an inherent complementarity between ways of knowing which are integral to what it means to be human. An absolutely distinctive role for the humanities is given by the fact that the objects studied by the humanities are real and yet different from given world objects because they are composed of signs inscribed on a material substrate, and because they exist in a world/space (the semiosphere) supplementary to the given world/space which provides the objects for scientific study. In the semiosphere are only unique textual objects, singulars like persons in society; it is the work of the humanities (academic and public) to discover knowledge from interactions with and between them. The semiosphere places together texts from across the whole spectrum of languages, media forms, cultures, times and places. What is critical about this is their plurality and multiplicity; in effect, the infinite possibilities for interactions in thought and for making the passage between the known and the as yet unknown. In this conception, which includes Derrida’s “university without condition” and McGann’s n-dimensional text, there are no privileged texts or disciplines. The chapter thus argues for a conception of expert intellectual work which is not bound by traditional humanities disciplines. Instead, it is grounded in a common theory of the text (which requires theories of language, mediality and fictionality) and a transversal practice, generative of knowledge by making crossings between texts marked by diverse origins in culture, language, institution and history. But language is privileged, in the sense that it is the fundamental means by which humanity expresses thought and conserves its knowledge; it is also unavoidably plural and heterogeneous, so that this work of knowledge formation is also plural and heterogeneous in its outcomes. It is productive of axioms and themes which can cross cultures and expand our understanding of what it means to be human, but which cannot aspire to the status of universals. Writing and reading, in diverse forms, media and languages, are the fundamental technologies of the humanities. In the new order of networked information technologies the form of writing which may have a much greater capacity to engage singularity with supercomplexity (than the academic article or book) is the essay (re)formed in the digital space of writing.</p>
<p>It is rarely possible to demonstrate a clear causal track between singular instances of writing and collective changes in thinking, belief, and social practice, as the increasingly complex analysis of the historical formation of societies and institutions demonstrates. Retrospectively, it is conventional to identify some authors as founders of thought leading to profound changes in social reality, for example, St Paul in respect of Christianity, Galileo in respect of science, Marx in respect of political economy, Freud and Jung in respect of human psychology, Hayek in respect of neoliberalism, or Foucault in respect of the institutions of government. Each of them conveyed answers to the question, what does it mean to be human? I have sought to keep Milton in mind as such a founder.  <i>Paradise Lost</i> was read intensively for two centuries after its publication, giving shape to the manifold potentials of protestant democratic thought in the minds of its socially diverse readers. The poem was made present to them in both the highest achievements of the art of the book and in its cheapest formats in social contexts increasingly remote in time and place from the moment of composition, an agent of British protestant culture carried across the globe as the British Empire expanded its reach. This is just one example of the conversation of the humanities as knowledge is created and re-created over time through reading, writing and speaking subjects and the flows of understanding which accumulate in scholarly interpretation and other forms of commentary, and which are decisively expressed in social and political action.</p>
<p>The accumulating effects of new thinking in acts of collective decision-making are what really matter from the perspective of humanistic knowledge. Events generated as embodiments (singular or collective enactments) of foundational thinking require for their occurrence long-term, multi-generational processes of subject formation through education, socialisation, politicisation, and legal, institutional and governmental change. The productivity of humanistic knowledge is most fully realised in the work of civil society organisations. As I have argued, the city is the social domain which concentrates these processes and derives its human purpose from them; it is in that place that the diffusion and exchange of the collectivity of human thinking is at its most intensive, where the greatest diversity and potential in knowledge can be encountered. But it is encountered at its ground level in the singular human mind, whose thought in so far as it reaches beyond the boundaries of the known and the calculable is inherently poetic and fictive.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s6.2">6.2 The Education State</h3>
<p>The institutions of the state through which humanistic knowledge is disseminated and conserved have a primarily educational purpose and motivation, in which the economy is an important but not a determinative component. They recognise that humanity, through imagination, collective memory, learning and cultural formation, is engaged in an unceasing and collective process of social and cultural reproduction and transformation, one aspect of which is technological and economic innovation in the context of environmental change. In this conception, the human life span (long term) rather than the time span of the economy (short term) should constitute the temporal frame of government policy formation and direct the work of public sector agencies. For this orientation of thought and work to be possible, public sector agencies must be dissociated from the political interests of any governing party, and be capable of taking the long view on the public’s behalf (as universities are supposed to do). It seems to have been forgotten under the neoliberal consensus that public sector agencies are funded by the people, not by any political party; they therefore have a higher duty than to conform in their knowledge work to shifting political prescriptions, while also recognising that policy formation is not a value-free activity. It has to be the task of any political party in government to explain and justify to the people, especially through Parliament, how their policies assist in meeting the long term development goals of their society and constructively reconcile disparate public conceptions of those goals; and it has to be the task of the public sector to provide benchmarks against which policy proposals and new laws can be measured. The concept of public value provides a standard against which the work of public sector agencies can be assessed by the public; reciprocally, a democratic society depends for its adequate functioning upon well-informed citizens who grasp the point of life-long learning and participation in democratic decision-making.</p>
<p>The role of media, information and communications technologies is critical in a society’s management of its possible futures, but the social competence of this complex, high technology system is deeply compromised by its being operated for profit by private owners. A democratic society cannot properly exist without equal and open access to the means of communication available to its members, just as it cannot exist without access to clean water or breathable air. As I have argued, the creation of new knowledge depends upon open access to knowledge of all kinds, and the freedom to exchange one’s thinking with others. That freedom is manifested in the infinity of conversations which link people momentarily to one another and provide the first and most universal means for the transmission of new ideas. By placing gateways across the means by which citizens can have access to others and share their thoughts, private ownership of the means of communication and textual conservation limits the potential of singular minds in a collective process of exchange to discover and formulate new knowledge. It must be obvious that this issue is very different from the formulation of protocols for the use of communications systems, which is a task for government and not the private sector. In a democratic state, the exemplary scene of this public conversation and the protocols by which it should be conducted is Parliament; the exemplary technology is the law. The measure of the civil quality of a society and its ability collectively to produce its future in a form which enables more of human potential to be realised in that place is the quality of the public conversation among its citizens. A critical index of that quality is the public support for and engagement with a diverse civil society sector.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s6.3">6.3 Cultural policy</h3>
<p>Taking the semiosphere as the given world for knowledge creation in the humanities means placing knowledge work in the larger domain of culture rather than the narrower domain of techno-science and the economy. Crucial institutions for the conservation and dissemination of a society’s knowledge are its cultural institutions – all levels of education, libraries, museums, archives, galleries, digital repositories. As distinct from organisations using knowledge for profit, it is only the state which can ensure the long-term protection and development of these fundamental institutions. Without them, a (national) society at best becomes tunnel visioned, amnesiac, inattentive to its inherited structuring principles, indifferent to the generative value of multiple cultural origins and kinds of learning.</p>
<p>At present, cultural policy in New Zealand is broken-backed, typically stuck within the terms of a creative arts policy reinforced by arguments for the economic value of the arts, and apparently unable to bring to bear the knowledge already held in cultural policy agencies based on a much more inclusive conception of culture than that informing arts policy. This matters because it is fundamental to my argument for the humanities that new knowledge of cultural value (humanistic knowledge) is given definition in local communities as well as by expert work in academic humanities. What connects them is the conversation of society, located within cultural fields and concentrated and amplified by cities as medium and record of this conversation. This is the proper context for media policy, which should aim at ensuring that humanistic knowledge can circulate freely across all of a society’s channels of communication. To attend to the circumstances which make humanistic knowledge productive of new thinking is to attend to the social processes characteristic of cultural knowledge creation, which includes the creation of scientific and economic knowledge as significant components but embraces the whole spectrum of value-laden knowledge constituting a particular national society and giving it its identity. A selective policy, as now, ensures the literal and metaphorical impoverishment of a society’s primary resource, its accumulated stocks of knowledge and its ability to multiply them.</p>
<p>In this humanistically oriented conception of knowledge, the possibility of discovering the new in thought, the as yet unknown, is generally attributed to singular minds embedded culturally in diverse flows of information and knowledge. One site of this embeddedness is the university, each institution gaining part of its distinctiveness from being a local opening to the richness of the semiosphere. For a new humanities, it is the opportunities offered by encounters with textual diversity to discover what is yet to be known by following “the logic of the unknown” that gives the university its significance. <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a> argues that it is the work of art which exposes humanistic thinking most fully to the as yet unknown, the void beyond the borders of the semiosphere. Just as the sciences locate their model of innovative knowledge creation in the expert scientist, observation, experimental method, the laboratory, and the research institute, so a new humanities needs a model of innovative knowledge creation based on axiomatic thinking, theorisation and textual analysis which enables productive engagement with the interests of the education state in knowledge work and cultural policy. The conception I have elaborated in the last chapter is founded on the work of art as a kind of object which is designed to generate events in thought by using knowledge and signs, but which does not by itself create knowledge. It is the second and third stages in the interaction of a reader/subject of the work, moving from experience of the event, to thought about it, and communication of that thought in some form, that generates the possibility of new knowledge. As a distinctive kind of object in the semiosphere, governed by “no law but wit”, the work of art is free to cross the borders of what is currently known and knowable; following the work across those borders and coming back generates the possibility of new understanding. For a new academic humanities, as the expert level of knowledge work on the side of culture in its textual manifestations and as a mode of enquiry founded and practiced in written language, the greatest challenge is posed by the poem as a place where language and the void come together. In this context, the claim that a new humanities and its exponent, an expert humanist, is capable of producing new knowledge at fundamental levels of thought is grounded in the analysis and interpretation of works of art, and specifically of poems.</p>
<p>This humanistic conception of the way in which the new enters the collective mind of society is hardly useful to a government maintaining a short-term focus on economic outcomes. But it does draw attention to the limitations of policies for knowledge and innovation which are defined by the closed circuit between techno-scientific knowledge creation, business and the economy. Treating that segment as a subset of a socially much more extensive and inclusive process of innovation through knowledge created culturally by citizens in every aspect of human living opens the possibility of a major re-orientation of policy priorities towards the cultural seed beds of discovery by singular minds informed by the cultural inventories which they have been able to accumulate through life-times of experience and learning. As this whole study shows, it is only government which can create the conditions for socially distributed innovation, and the umbrella under which this work should be carried out is cultural policy.</p>
<h3 class="sec1" id="s6.4">6.4 Creating the conditions</h3>
<p>Government cannot anticipate or plan for innovation, but it can manage the conditions which encourage the invention and application of new ideas, as Milton argued in his own time for the city of London as an engine of discovery. One critical condition is the role of the public sector, which needs to be repositioned as a public resource, like tertiary education institutions, for the evaluation and application of world knowledge to local social and economic development and democratic decision-making. Another is cultural policy focused on the twin social media environments of education and communication, with the aim of ensuring that: the classroom, like society’s memory institutions and its coffee bars, is enriched by the exchange of all kinds of knowledge and experience: the communications networks of society are open and accessible to everyone; and human rights – civic, political, economic, social and cultural – are woven into the law, education, and the fabric of social practice and cultural values. A third is the vigour and diversity of civil society organisations as the social space in which individuals can give active expression to their knowledge and values. Specifically, guiding a new form of knowledge politics concerned to anticipate the social effects of new knowledge as a public conversation has become a critical democratic responsibility. Each of us has to find what connects us to the evolution of the long term purposes of the society into which we are born; governments lose the plot when they try to manage in the short term the outcomes of what is fundamentally a personal and lifelong search for meaning and discovery of value. Creativity and innovation are intrinsic to human living and to social adaptation to change, which has its roots in each person and not in top down directives issued by the state. Cultural policy is the proper context within which the state’s and nation’s interests in this fundamental work of embodied knowing and acting can be defined and sustained, and where the framing goals are the just society and the true life.</p>
<p>This book is an assemblage of written voices, brought into one conversation among the innumerable conversations which their words might, do and will engage. As Carr did, it asks its readers to “Think with me”, to wonder about what it could possibly mean to be human, to explore the swarming richness of our human inheritance of thought, to formulate possible futures from that inheritance and the terms of living and thinking in our local presents, to converse with others and to decide, moment by moment, how to embody those meanings in social action. To leave the last (for the moment) word to Derrida. He, like Sidney and Badiou and Carr and the poets discussed in <a href="13_ST_CHR5.xhtml#ch5">Chapter Five</a>, locates the ultimate purpose of knowledge creation in the intellectually and morally informed actions of individuals who are motivated to participate in and work out the ongoing evolution of the city as the primary scene of the revelation of what it does, can and should mean to be human. Here, then, is the ultimate purpose of a new humanities, to create new knowledge – to reframe and repurpose the idea of humanity - from the texts of the semiosphere (and most profoundly from the texts of the poets), a collective process founded on singular minds contextualised by their life histories. Humanistic knowledge is formed and expressed in momentary decisions and actions situated in local times and cultural spaces (embodied as texts and persons) which are open to some part of the infinite in thought and the to-come. It is a mode of learning in which acquiring knowledge carries with it a double imperative, to question its own foundations and</p>
<p class="quote">to aspire to something more consequential, to change things and to intervene in an efficient and responsible (though always, of course, in a mediated way), not only in the profession but in what one calls the city, the <i>polis</i>, and more generally the world. Not to change things in the no doubt rather naive sense of calculated, deliberate, and strategically controlled intervention, but in the sense of maximum intensification of a transformation in progress (1992: 8-9, author’s emphasis).</p>
