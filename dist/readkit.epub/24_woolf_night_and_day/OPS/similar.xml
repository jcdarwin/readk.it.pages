<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/6655.epub"><em>A Room
of One's Own</em></a>
<p>A Room of One's Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf.
First published on 24 October 1929, the essay was based on a series
of lectures she delivered at Newnham College and Girton College,
two women's colleges at Cambridge University in October 1928. While
this extended essay in fact employs a fictional narrator and
narrative to explore women both as writers of and characters in
fiction, the manuscript for the delivery of the series of lectures,
titled "Women and Fiction", and hence the essay, are considered
non-fiction. The essay is generally seen as a feminist text, and is
noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for
women writers within a literary tradition dominated by
patriarchy.</p>

Voyage Out</em></a>
<p>Rachel Vinrace embarks for South America on her father's ship
and is launched on a course of self-discovery in a kind of modern
mythical voyage. The mismatched jumble of passengers provide Woolf
with an opportunity to satirize Edwardian life. The novel
introduces Clarissa Dalloway, the central character of Woolf's
later novel, Mrs. Dalloway. Two of the other characters were
modeled after important figures in Woolf's life. St John Hirst is a
fictional portrayal of Lytton Strachey and Helen Ambrose is to some
extent inspired by Woolf's sister, Vanessa Bell. And Rachel's
journey from a cloistered life in a London suburb to freedom,
challenging intellectual discourse and discovery very likely
reflects Woolf's own journey from a repressive household to the
intellectual stimulation of the Bloomsbury Group.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/6693.epub"><em>Flush:
A Biography</em></a>
<p>Flush: A Biography, an imaginative biography of Elizabeth
Barrett Browning's cocker spaniel, is a cross-genre blend of
fiction and nonfiction.<br />
Commonly read as a modernist consideration of city life seen
through the eyes of a dog, Flush serves as a harsh criticism of the
supposedly unnatural ways of living in the city. The figure of
Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the text is often read as an analogue
for other female intellectuals, like Woolf herself, who suffered
from illness, feigned or real, as a part of their status as female
writers. Most insightful and experimental are Woolf’s emotional and
philosophical views verbalized in Flush’s thoughts. As he spends
more time with Barrett Browning, Flush becomes emotionally and
spiritually connected to the poetess and both begin to understand
each other despite their language barriers. For Flush smell is
poetry, but for Barrett Browning, poetry is impossible without
words. In Flush Woolf examines the barriers that exist between
woman and animal created by language yet overcome through symbolic
actions.</p>

Room</em></a>
<p>The novel centres, in a very ambiguous way, around the life
story of the protagonist Jacob Flanders, and is presented entirely
by the impressions other characters have of Jacob (except for those
times when we do indeed get Jacob's perspective). Thus, although it
could be said that the book is primarily a character study and has
little in the way of plot or background, the narrative is
constructed as a void in place of the central character, if indeed
the novel can be said to have a 'protagonist' in conventional
terms.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/1234.epub"><em>To the
Lighthouse</em></a>
<p>To the Lighthouse (5 May 1927) is a novel by Virginia Woolf. A
landmark novel of high modernism, the text, centering on the Ramsay
family and their visits to the Isle of Skye in Scotland between
1910 and 1920, skillfully manipulates temporality and psychological
exploration.<br />
To the Lighthouse follows and extends the tradition of modernist
novelists like Marcel Proust and James Joyce, where the plot is
secondary to philosophical introspection, and the prose can be
winding and hard to follow. The novel includes little dialogue and
almost no action; most of it is written as thoughts and
observations. The novel recalls the power of childhood emotions and
highlights the impermanence of adult relationships. One of the
book's several themes is the ubiquity of transience.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/1231.epub"><em>Mrs.
Dalloway</em></a>
<p>Mrs Dalloway (published on 14 May 1925) is a novel by Virginia
Woolf that details a day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway in
post-World War I England. Mrs Dalloway continues to be one of
Woolf's best-known novels.<br />
Created from two short stories, "Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street" and
the unfinished "The Prime Minister", the novel's story is of
Clarissa's preparations for a party of which she is to be hostess.
With the interior perspective of the novel, the story travels
forwards and back in time, and in and out of the characters' minds,
to construct a complete image of Clarissa's life and of the
inter-war social structure.</p>

<a href="http://generation.feedbooks.com/book/6697.epub"><em>The
Master Criminal</em></a>
<p>A collection of 12 stories published serially in <i>The
Ludgate</i>, London, Jun 1897 to May 1898, in which the criminal
mastermind, Felix Gryde, conducts his nefarious criminal work --
theft, kidnapping, ransom, assassination, fraud -- and he never
gets caught. The author's introduction:</p>
<p>"The history of famous detectives, imaginary and otherwise, has
frequently been written, but the history of a famous
criminal—never.</p>
<p>"This is a bold statement, but a true one all the same. The most
notorious of rascals know that sooner or later they will be found
out, and therefore they plan their lives accordingly. But they are
always found out in the end. And yet there must be many colossal
rascals who have lived and died apparently in the odour of
sanctity. Such a character would be quite new to fiction, and
herein I propose to attempt the history of the Sherlock Holmes of
malefactors.</p>
<p>"Given a rascal with the intellect of the famous creation in
question, and detection would be reduced to a vanishing point. It
is the intention of the writer to set down here some of the
wonderful adventures that befell Felix Gryde in the course of his
remarkable career."</p>

River of Death: A Tale of London In Peril</em></a>
<p>Another in the "Doom of London" series, in which the author
sounds a clarion call of potential disasters that may fall upon the
great city. Here he relates a tale of environmental contamination
leading to a medical panic.</p>
<p>London in a year of severe drought; water level in the Thames
river extremely low, blazing heat wave for 3 weeks in August; a
Portuguese cargo ship sinks and contaminates a tributary of the
Thames; 3 of the crew members are discovered to be dying of some
disease; the local doctor is frightened by what he sees, calls the
health authorities, who call for help from Professor Darbyshire, a
scientist who deals with "fighting diseases in the bulk", someone
we might call an environmental epidemiologist today; he
investigates, then ... Darbyshire makes a hurried call asking his
friend, Dr. Longdale, to come at once to his house where he has a
small laboratory.</p>
<p>"Darbyshire produced a phial of cloudy fluid, some of which he
proceeded to lay on the glass of a powerful microscope. Longdale
fairly staggered back from the eyepiece. "Bubonic! The water reeks
with the bacillus! I haven't seen it so strongly marked since we
were in New Orleans together. Darbyshire, you don't mean to say
that this sample came from—"</p>
<p>Yes, the sample was water from the contaminated Thames, the
river from which roughly 4/5 of the water comes to supply the needs
of the 5 million Londoners. Longdale says the water system must be
shut off.</p>
<p>"And deprive four-fifths of London with water altogether!"
Darbyshire said grimly. "And London grilling like a furnace? No
flushing of sewers, no watering of roads, not even a drop to drink.
In two days London would be a reeking, seething hell — try and
picture it, Longdale."</p>
<p>"I have, often," Longdale said gloomily. "Sooner or later it had
to come. Now is your chance, Darbyshire — that process of
sterilisation of yours."</p>
<p>Will he save London? Of course — he's the hero of the story. But
how? Does London panic? How do the authorities respond?</p>

Have and To Hold</em></a>
<p>This was the #1 best-selling novel in the United States in 1900,
made into movies several times in subsequent years. It is set in
colonial North America, beginning in the year 1621. A new movie
adapted from the book was filmed in 2011.</p>
<p>The dialog is Early Modern English, somewhat similar to
Shakespeare's writings, not contemporary English but similar enough
to be understood. The narration is almost modern English, easily
understood.</p>
<p>An English soldier, Ralph Percy, turned Virginian explorer in
Jamestown colony, buys a wife -- a girl named Jocelyn Leigh -- not
knowing that she is the escaped ward of King James I, fleeing a
forced marriage to Lord Carnal. Jocelyn has no love for Ralph at
first; she even seems to abhor him and explains she only married to
have refuge after she fled from England, under an assumed name.
Lord Carnal, Jocelyn's husband-to-be, eventually comes to Jamestown
to find his promised bride, not knowing that Ralph Percy and
Jocelyn Leigh are already man and wife.</p>
<p>Lord Carnal attempts to kidnap Jocelyn several times and
eventually follows Ralph, Jocelyn, and their two companions, as
they escape from the King's orders to arrest Ralph and carry
Jocelyn back to England.</p>
<p>This romance-epic-adventure novel carries the reader along with
humor, shipwreck, pirates, entrapment, false accusations, trial,
colonial conflict with Native Americans, capture, rescue, suicide,
salvation, love, happy ending -- what more could one want?</p>
