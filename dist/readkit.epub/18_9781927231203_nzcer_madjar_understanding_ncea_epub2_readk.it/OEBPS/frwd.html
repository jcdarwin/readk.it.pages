<h1>FOREWORD</h1>
<p class="noindent">NCEA can seem like a mystery for those who are new to it. Many parents experienced a system where they were asked to study all year and then sit exams at the end (usually in the gym or the hall). They would then wait for their results to come in the mail, during January, to reveal whether they had succeeded or not. A whole year&#8217;s work depended on a few exams!</p>
<p class="noindent">This is not how NCEA works. Since NCEA was introduced in 2002 it has been reviewed and improved and has become New Zealand&#8217;s main qualification system for secondary school students. But it is not as straightforward as the exam-based qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent">There were good reasons for introducing NCEA. The nature and range of jobs have changed since parents were at school, tertiary education no longer depends solely on end-of-year exams, and there are many more tertiary courses to choose from. This means that today&#8217;s students need to be prepared differently.</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of the modern workplace: the job performance review is based on many things that occurred during the past year and not on one single task. During the year an employee will be asked to complete many tasks, learn new things and put these into practice. This is the same with NCEA: there are many ways to learn new things (via credits and courses), many ways to put these into practice (internal and external assessments), and multiple ways for performance to be valued (Excellent, Merit, Achieved). As in the average workplace (and certainly when learning challenging material), there may also be more than one opportunity to succeed in a task.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, this flexibility of NCEA comes with complexity, which can lead to many questions. This book aims to provide many of the answers and to help you identify which questions to ask. It is based on a number of years of research in schools&#8212;interviewing students, teachers and parents, analysing patterns and results, and publishing many articles. The complexity of NCEA means there can be &#8220;chokepoints&#8221;: points where poor decisions are made that can have negative consequences on students&#8217; aspirations. It could be that the school does not offer the optimal balance of courses for the student to choose from. Students could be aiming too low and choosing the easier subjects, which may later prevent access to desired courses. Or students and families may not be planning a sequence through NCEA. This book will be invaluable for addressing these and many other chokepoints, and the questions that arise from them.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Starpath team is the foremost research group on NCEA, analysing the effects in schools and the effects of NCEA on students when they move beyond the school gates into tertiary study, the workplace and other destinations. One of the more exciting findings is that performance in NCEA is among the world&#8217;s best predictors of success in later studies. This is because NCEA requires that students learn to study <i>throughout</i> the year, complete assignments to specified standards, and learn continually from these assignments how to improve their work. Their performance is assessed across many pieces of work and not just one test on one day of the year. This is how university and most workplaces now operate.</p>
<p class="noindent">I encourage parents and students to use this book as a source of information and a point of discussion, to work through the examples seeing how the courses are put together and, most importantly, know what questions to ask your school. Don&#8217;t leave the school out of the questioning&#8212;they are keen to help answer your queries&#8212;and after reading this book you are more likely to have the right questions to ask them.</p>
