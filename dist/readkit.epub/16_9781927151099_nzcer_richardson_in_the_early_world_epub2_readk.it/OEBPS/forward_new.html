<h1 class="center">FOREWORD</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><small>This</small> edition of In The Early World is a celebration. It is a testament to the creative power of children and celebrates the artistry of a sensitive teacher as he crafted a ‘new’ approach to teaching and learning. It is the legacy of a remarkable pioneer, Elwyn Richardson&#8212;today, Elwyn Richardson QSO, Dip. Tchg, DLit.</p>
<p class="indent">In The Early World, together with the work of other educational pioneers&#8212;C. E. Beeby, Sylvia Ashton-Warner, Dame Marie Clay and the many creative teachers that followed&#8212;changed the course of education in New Zealand and across the world. Drawing on the many strands of ‘new’ thinking of the time, these teacher-pioneers became driven by a belief in the creative power of children. They rejected the practices of their day that marginalised the child, thus laying the foundations for a child-centred approach, unique to New Zealand.</p>
<p class="indent">This child-centred approach was rooted in the belief that children, while engaged in the activities of a community, create their own identities and language through the boot-strapping effect of their own successes. Feeling and intellect, living and learning were inseparably intertwined. Elwyn’s ‘creative approach’ is an exemplar of this work.</p>
<p class="indent">The high achievement of children who had been exposed to this ‘new’ child-centred approach propelled New Zealand to international fame; its underlying tenets have subsequently been vindicated by empirical research, and the premise that the child is the centre of teaching and learning influences the curriculum today.</p>
<p class="indent">But … times have changed; we live in a different era, and education has continued to evolve. With the passage of time, educational decision-making has shifted from such innovative educators to non-teaching politicians and policy makers; and in the classroom, from practising teachers to academics. Education has become increasingly guided by documents of their making.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike our early educational pioneers whose prime interest was the child, this ‘new’ guard of decision makers juggles political, fiscal, and/or research agendas alongside concerns for children. This juggling can be detected in current outcome-based documents which (supposedly) &#8216;put students at the centre of teaching and learning&#8217;.<a id="fn1_ref" href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">For many years teachers have struggled not only with perennial educational dichotomies (many highlighted in this book<a id="fn2_ref" href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>) but also with the conflicting demands inherent in these outcome-based documents&#8212;in particular, the demands for accountability&#8212;based on the precise articulation of outcomes as well as their measurement. As a result, the basic tenets of our unique child-centred approach outlined above have been compromised.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, essential elements of child-centred practices have been diluted, even distorted, by the competing non-developmental theories of academics who are charged with providing ‘input’&#8212;input to achieve the prescribed outcomes and at the same time to measure them. Once again, the child’s creative power has been strangled and the child marginalised. History has 
repeated itself.</p>
<p class="indent">In effect, we have come full circle. Although the dichotomies requiring resolution have changed and the resources and technologies we use are different, an old challenge has re-emerged. How can we put the lives of children and our trust in their creative power back into classroom practice?</p>
<p class="indent">This edition of In The Early World is both timely and important, for this challenge is at the heart of present debate. It provides a backdrop to current issues in education and to teachers’ concerns&#8212;the narrowing of the curriculum, the setting of externally prescribed adult-motivated progressions and outputs that neglect the developmental nature of learning. These issues and concerns are the consequences of an outcome-based curriculum.</p>
<p class="indent">In The Early World has the potential to build understanding between primary school educators and non-teaching administrators, politicians and academics who, at most, have limited child-centered teaching experience, if any. But, more importantly, this book tells two parallel stories that point to a way forward.</p>
<p class="indent">The first story is Elwyn’s story. This is a story of an innovative teacher breaking away from a teacher-dominated approach and simultaneously learning to trust the creative power of children. Through the journey he learns to be both teacher and learner&#8212;the hallmark of a child-centred teacher. By trial and error, he constantly searches for a balance between acts of leading and acts of learning from the children. And, in doing so, he learns how to successfully craft unique paths of development for the individual based on developing sets of school community values.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout this story, the way forward was not always clear and as each new development is explored, the reader can sense the anxiety and tensions inherent in change, in the creative process and the approach itself. But his dogged trust in the creative power of children never falters:</p>
<blockquote><p class="noindent">
In all [his] work the production of poems or pictures or the gaining of specific facts or techniques was always secondary to the growth of the children.<a id="fn3_ref" href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="indent">He questions the value of existing practices, his use of resources and even his teacher-generated topic studies. He notices that these remnants of the past engender look-good products but contain ‘second-hand thoughts’ resulting in contrived adult-like forms and structures. He struggles to balance his dual role: &#8216;Am I over-directing or am I under-directing?&#8217;, and often abandons his own planning in favour of the teachable moment. He is swept along by the recognition of ‘significant developments’ and the quality of his children’s thinking and expression that emerges. Over time, he rejects all practices that undermine the sincerity and truth of children’s own thinking and expression. In the end the children are triumphant. Their learning is rooted in their own lives.</p>
<p class="indent">The second story is entwined with the first and is told, in part, through the voices and imagery of the children’s own work. This story captures the universal experience of children ‘learning to be’&#8212;to be members of a caring and respectful community of artists, craftspersons, scientists, historians, inventors, researchers. Through this experience the children learned to accept themselves and others. Living, learning and language became inseparable and their worth assessed by reference to core values deeply embedded in their own lives. According to the Asia-Pacific Network for International Education and Values, the values that underpin ‘learning to be’ are &#8216;timeless and spiritual in nature and apply to all human beings&#8217;.<a id="fn4_ref" href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> In this respect In The Early World too is timeless and has universal appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">In this second story, values drive both the pursuit of excellence and reveal the worth of the pursuit itself. The underlying theme is how values and excellence&#8212;the goals of the pursuit&#8212;are formed. The forming is portrayed as a process based on the recurring recognition of small excellence and developing sets of community standards. These snippets of excellence, no matter how small, are teased out from the mediocre. They are displayed and evaluated by the individuals and by the developing community of individuals. These snippets had ‘simulative power’ and provided the ‘stepping stones’ for ‘further thinking and expanded in-depth expression’. In this way, the children’s own competencies and strengths determined the pathway for development in life and learning, in thinking and expression and ‘learning to be’.</p>
<p class="indent">Decades later, Marie Clay wrote that acts precede awareness and &#8216;different paths (lead) to common outcomes,&#8217;<a id="fn5_ref" href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> while Tharp and Gallimore claim:</p>
<blockquote><p class="noindent">
In the beginning … the child need not understand the activity as the adult understands it, need not be aware of its reasons or of its articulation with other activities … all that is needed is successful performance, through assisted interaction.<a id="fn6_ref" href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="indent">Success in these stories was sustained by the knowledge and professional artistry of a caring teacher who esteemed the voice and thinking of the children; appreciated value-based performance whatever its source; and recognised significant developments based on core values that underpin ‘learning to be’.</p>
<p class="indent">The ways of working captured through these stories are in stark contrast to those that have emerged in the last decades. Current ways are based on clearly articulated and predetermined pathways. The children are forced to state goals and are evaluated through criteria and standards that conform not to their own understanding of themselves in the world, but by expectations dissected from the forms and structures of adult thinking. These outcome-based approaches, like the teacher-dominated approaches of yesteryear, are the antithesis of child-centred approaches. They marginalise children and show little respect for their creative power to develop their own life-learning pathways.</p>
<p class="indent">These stories show us a way through current dilemmas and concerns. However, for many teachers, especially primary teachers, the knowledge and professional artistry of their child-centred practice has been usurped; the courage and tenacity of the pioneering spirit stifled; and the recognition and trust of the child’s creative power has been undermined. The aesthetic quality of the student’s art work, the success of their inventions, the accuracy of their scientific observations and the quality of language in this book should inspire and convince teachers that this trust is warranted.</p>
<p class="indent">In The Early World, together with the stories of other early pioneers, tempered with new insights about human development and language acquisition, has the power to inspire a ‘new’ guard of educational pioneers. This edition celebrates the pioneering spirit of New Zealand teachers.</p>
