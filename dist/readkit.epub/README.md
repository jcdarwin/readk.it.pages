The EPUB files in this directory contain Readkit, meaning they will function as conventional EPUB files, readable in all compliant EPUB reading systems.

However, they can also be opened for reading in a browser as follows:

* Unzip the EPUB (or use the unzipped form of the EPUB content, also in this directory)

The EPUB content can then be read in one of three different ways using Readkit:

1. Navigate to the readk.it folder, which will be normally found within the OEBPS (or equivalent) folder of the EPUB content, and double-click the index.html file to open the content in a browser (i.e. using a file URL)
2. Web-serve the EPUB from the its root directory, and then in the browser navigate to the Readk.it index.html file, e.g. <code>http://localhost:8000/OEBPS/readk.it/index.html</code>
3. Either using a file URL or web-served, drag and drop another EPUB file onto the browser window to start reading the new file.
