<h3 class="section_title">The Fisherman and his Soul</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Every evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and
threw his nets into the water.</p>
<p>When the wind blew from the land he caught nothing, or but
little at best, for it was a bitter and black-winged wind, and
rough waves rose up to meet it.&#160; But when the wind blew to the
shore, the fish came in from the deep, and swam into the meshes of
his nets, and he took them to the market-place and sold them.</p>
<p>Every evening he went out upon the sea, and one evening the net
was so heavy that hardly could he draw it into the boat.&#160; And
he laughed, and said to himself, ‘Surely I have caught all the fish
that swim, or snared some dull monster that will be a marvel to
men, or some thing of horror that the great Queen will desire,’ and
putting forth all his strength, he tugged at the coarse ropes till,
like lines of blue enamel round a vase of bronze, the long veins
rose up on his arms.&#160; He tugged at the thin ropes, and nearer
and nearer came the circle of flat corks, and the net rose at last
to the top of the water.</p>
<p>But no fish at all was in it, nor any monster or thing of
horror, but only a little Mermaid lying fast asleep.</p>
<p>Her hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as
a thread of fine gold in a cup of glass.&#160; Her body was as
white ivory, and her tail was of silver and pearl.&#160; Silver and
pearl was her tail, and the green weeds of the sea coiled round it;
and like sea-shells were her ears, and her lips were like
sea-coral.&#160; The cold waves dashed over her cold breasts, and
the salt glistened upon her eyelids.</p>
<p>So beautiful was she that when the young Fisherman saw her he
was filled with wonder, and he put out his hand and drew the net
close to him, and leaning over the side he clasped her in his
arms.&#160; And when he touched her, she gave a cry like a startled
sea-gull, and woke, and looked at him in terror with her
mauve-amethyst eyes, and struggled that she might escape.&#160; But
he held her tightly to him, and would not suffer her to depart.</p>
<p>And when she saw that she could in no way escape from him, she
began to weep, and said, ‘I pray thee let me go, for I am the only
daughter of a King, and my father is aged and alone.’</p>
<p>But the young Fisherman answered, ‘I will not let thee go save
thou makest me a promise that whenever I call thee, thou wilt come
and sing to me, for the fish delight to listen to the song of the
Sea-folk, and so shall my nets be full.’</p>
<p>‘Wilt thou in very truth let me go, if I promise thee this?’
cried the Mermaid.</p>
<p>‘In very truth I will let thee go,’ said the young
Fisherman.</p>
<p>So she made him the promise he desired, and sware it by the oath
of the Sea-folk.&#160; And he loosened his arms from about her, and
she sank down into the water, trembling with a strange fear.</p>
<p>Every evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and
called to the Mermaid, and she rose out of the water and sang to
him.&#160; Round and round her swam the dolphins, and the wild
gulls wheeled above her head.</p>
<p>And she sang a marvellous song.&#160; For she sang of the
Sea-folk who drive their flocks from cave to cave, and carry the
little calves on their shoulders; of the Tritons who have long
green beards, and hairy breasts, and blow through twisted conchs
when the King passes by; of the palace of the King which is all of
amber, with a roof of clear emerald, and a pavement of bright
pearl; and of the gardens of the sea where the great filigrane fans
of coral wave all day long, and the fish dart about like silver
birds, and the anemones cling to the rocks, and the pinks bourgeon
in the ribbed yellow sand.&#160; She sang of the big whales that
come down from the north seas and have sharp icicles hanging to
their fins; of the Sirens who tell of such wonderful things that
the merchants have to stop their ears with wax lest they should
hear them, and leap into the water and be drowned; of the sunken
galleys with their tall masts, and the frozen sailors clinging to
the rigging, and the mackerel swimming in and out of the open
portholes; of the little barnacles who are great travellers, and
cling to the keels of the ships and go round and round the world;
and of the cuttlefish who live in the sides of the cliffs and
stretch out their long black arms, and can make night come when
they will it.&#160; She sang of the nautilus who has a boat of her
own that is carved out of an opal and steered with a silken sail;
of the happy Mermen who play upon harps and can charm the great
Kraken to sleep; of the little children who catch hold of the
slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon their backs; of the
Mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their arms to the
mariners; and of the sea-lions with their curved tusks, and the
sea-horses with their floating manes.</p>
<p>And as she sang, all the tunny-fish came in from the deep to
listen to her, and the young Fisherman threw his nets round them
and caught them, and others he took with a spear.&#160; And when
his boat was well-laden, the Mermaid would sink down into the sea,
smiling at him.</p>
<p>Yet would she never come near him that he might touch her.&#160;
Oftentimes he called to her and prayed of her, but she would not;
and when he sought to seize her she dived into the water as a seal
might dive, nor did he see her again that day.&#160; And each day
the sound of her voice became sweeter to his ears.&#160; So sweet
was her voice that he forgot his nets and his cunning, and had no
care of his craft.&#160; Vermilion-finned and with eyes of bossy
gold, the tunnies went by in shoals, but he heeded them not.&#160;
His spear lay by his side unused, and his baskets of plaited osier
were empty.&#160; With lips parted, and eyes dim with wonder, he
sat idle in his boat and listened, listening till the sea-mists
crept round him, and the wandering moon stained his brown limbs
with silver.</p>
<p>And one evening he called to her, and said: ‘Little Mermaid,
little Mermaid, I love thee.&#160; Take me for thy bridegroom, for
I love thee.’</p>
<p>But the Mermaid shook her head.&#160; ‘Thou hast a human soul,’
she answered.&#160; ‘If only thou wouldst send away thy soul, then
could I love thee.’</p>
<p>And the young Fisherman said to himself, ‘Of what use is my soul
to me?&#160; I cannot see it.&#160; I may not touch it.&#160; I do
not know it.&#160; Surely I will send it away from me, and much
gladness shall be mine.’&#160; And a cry of joy broke from his
lips, and standing up in the painted boat, he held out his arms to
the Mermaid.&#160; ‘I will send my soul away,’ he cried, ‘and you
shall be my bride, and I will be thy bridegroom, and in the depth
of the sea we will dwell together, and all that thou hast sung of
thou shalt show me, and all that thou desirest I will do, nor shall
our lives be divided.’</p>
<p>And the little Mermaid laughed for pleasure and hid her face in
her hands.</p>
<p>‘But how shall I send my soul from me?’ cried the young
Fisherman.&#160; ‘Tell me how I may do it, and lo! it shall be
done.’</p>
<p>‘Alas!&#160; I know not,’ said the little Mermaid: ‘the Sea-folk
have no souls.’&#160; And she sank down into the deep, looking
wistfully at him.</p>
<p>Now early on the next morning, before the sun was the span of a
man’s hand above the hill, the young Fisherman went to the house of
the Priest and knocked three times at the door.</p>
<p>The novice looked out through the wicket, and when he saw who it
was, he drew back the latch and said to him, ‘Enter.’</p>
<p>And the young Fisherman passed in, and knelt down on the
sweet-smelling rushes of the floor, and cried to the Priest who was
reading out of the Holy Book and said to him, ‘Father, I am in love
with one of the Sea-folk, and my soul hindereth me from having my
desire.&#160; Tell me how I can send my soul away from me, for in
truth I have no need of it.&#160; Of what value is my soul to
me?&#160; I cannot see it.&#160; I may not touch it.&#160; I do not
know it.’</p>
<p>And the Priest beat his breast, and answered, ‘Alack, alack,
thou art mad, or hast eaten of some poisonous herb, for the soul is
the noblest part of man, and was given to us by God that we should
nobly use it.&#160; There is no thing more precious than a human
soul, nor any earthly thing that can be weighed with it.&#160; It
is worth all the gold that is in the world, and is more precious
than the rubies of the kings.&#160; Therefore, my son, think not
any more of this matter, for it is a sin that may not be
forgiven.&#160; And as for the Sea-folk, they are lost, and they
who would traffic with them are lost also.&#160; They are as the
beasts of the field that know not good from evil, and for them the
Lord has not died.’</p>
<p>The young Fisherman’s eyes filled with tears when he heard the
bitter words of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said
to him, ‘Father, the Fauns live in the forest and are glad, and on
the rocks sit the Mermen with their harps of red gold.&#160; Let me
be as they are, I beseech thee, for their days are as the days of
flowers.&#160; And as for my soul, what doth my soul profit me, if
it stand between me and the thing that I love?’</p>
<p>‘The love of the body is vile,’ cried the Priest, knitting his
brows, ‘and vile and evil are the pagan things God suffers to
wander through His world.&#160; Accursed be the Fauns of the
woodland, and accursed be the singers of the sea!&#160; I have
heard them at night-time, and they have sought to lure me from my
beads.&#160; They tap at the window, and laugh.&#160; They whisper
into my ears the tale of their perilous joys.&#160; They tempt me
with temptations, and when I would pray they make mouths at
me.&#160; They are lost, I tell thee, they are lost.&#160; For them
there is no heaven nor hell, and in neither shall they praise God’s
name.’</p>
<p>‘Father,’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘thou knowest not what thou
sayest.&#160; Once in my net I snared the daughter of a King.&#160;
She is fairer than the morning star, and whiter than the
moon.&#160; For her body I would give my soul, and for her love I
would surrender heaven.&#160; Tell me what I ask of thee, and let
me go in peace.’</p>
<p>‘Away!&#160; Away!’ cried the Priest: ‘thy leman is lost, and
thou shalt be lost with her.’</p>
<p>And he gave him no blessing, but drove him from his door.</p>
<p>And the young Fisherman went down into the market-place, and he
walked slowly, and with bowed head, as one who is in sorrow.</p>
<p>And when the merchants saw him coming, they began to whisper to
each other, and one of them came forth to meet him, and called him
by name, and said to him, ‘What hast thou to sell?’</p>
<p>‘I will sell thee my soul,’ he answered.&#160; ‘I pray thee buy
it of me, for I am weary of it.&#160; Of what use is my soul to
me?&#160; I cannot see it.&#160; I may not touch it.&#160; I do not
know it.’</p>
<p>But the merchants mocked at him, and said, ‘Of what use is a
man’s soul to us?&#160; It is not worth a clipped piece of
silver.&#160; Sell us thy body for a slave, and we will clothe thee
in sea-purple, and put a ring upon thy finger, and make thee the
minion of the great Queen.&#160; But talk not of the soul, for to
us it is nought, nor has it any value for our service.’</p>
<p>And the young Fisherman said to himself: ‘How strange a thing
this is!&#160; The Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the
gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth a
clipped piece of silver.’&#160; And he passed out of the
market-place, and went down to the shore of the sea, and began to
ponder on what he should do.</p>
<p>And at noon he remembered how one of his companions, who was a
gatherer of samphire, had told him of a certain young Witch who
dwelt in a cave at the head of the bay and was very cunning in her
witcheries.&#160; And he set to and ran, so eager was he to get rid
of his soul, and a cloud of dust followed him as he sped round the
sand of the shore.&#160; By the itching of her palm the young Witch
knew his coming, and she laughed and let down her red hair.&#160;
With her red hair falling around her, she stood at the opening of
the cave, and in her hand she had a spray of wild hemlock that was
blossoming.</p>
<p>‘What d’ye lack?&#160; What d’ye lack?’ she cried, as he came
panting up the steep, and bent down before her.&#160; ‘Fish for thy
net, when the wind is foul?&#160; I have a little reed-pipe, and
when I blow on it the mullet come sailing into the bay.&#160; But
it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.&#160; What d’ye
lack?&#160; What d’ye lack?&#160; A storm to wreck the ships, and
wash the chests of rich treasure ashore?&#160; I have more storms
than the wind has, for I serve one who is stronger than the wind,
and with a sieve and a pail of water I can send the great galleys
to the bottom of the sea.&#160; But I have a price, pretty boy, I
have a price.&#160; What d’ye lack?&#160; What d’ye lack?&#160; I
know a flower that grows in the valley, none knows it but I.&#160;
It has purple leaves, and a star in its heart, and its juice is as
white as milk.&#160; Shouldst thou touch with this flower the hard
lips of the Queen, she would follow thee all over the world.&#160;
Out of the bed of the King she would rise, and over the whole world
she would follow thee.&#160; And it has a price, pretty boy, it has
a price.&#160; What d’ye lack?&#160; What d’ye lack?&#160; I can
pound a toad in a mortar, and make broth of it, and stir the broth
with a dead man’s hand.&#160; Sprinkle it on thine enemy while he
sleeps, and he will turn into a black viper, and his own mother
will slay him.&#160; With a wheel I can draw the Moon from heaven,
and in a crystal I can show thee Death.&#160; What d’ye lack?&#160;
What d’ye lack?&#160; Tell me thy desire, and I will give it thee,
and thou shalt pay me a price, pretty boy, thou shalt pay me a
price.’</p>
<p>‘My desire is but for a little thing,’ said the young Fisherman,
‘yet hath the Priest been wroth with me, and driven me forth.&#160;
It is but for a little thing, and the merchants have mocked at me,
and denied me.&#160; Therefore am I come to thee, though men call
thee evil, and whatever be thy price I shall pay it.’</p>
<p>‘What wouldst thou?’ asked the Witch, coming near to him.</p>
<p>‘I would send my soul away from me,’ answered the young
Fisherman.</p>
<p>The Witch grew pale, and shuddered, and hid her face in her blue
mantle.&#160; ‘Pretty boy, pretty boy,’ she muttered, ‘that is a
terrible thing to do.’</p>
<p>He tossed his brown curls and laughed.&#160; ‘My soul is nought
to me,’ he answered.&#160; ‘I cannot see it.&#160; I may not touch
it.&#160; I do not know it.’</p>
<p>‘What wilt thou give me if I tell thee?’ asked the Witch,
looking down at him with her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>‘Five pieces of gold,’ he said, ‘and my nets, and the wattled
house where I live, and the painted boat in which I sail.&#160;
Only tell me how to get rid of my soul, and I will give thee all
that I possess.’</p>
<p>She laughed mockingly at him, and struck him with the spray of
hemlock.&#160; ‘I can turn the autumn leaves into gold,’ she
answered, ‘and I can weave the pale moonbeams into silver if I will
it.&#160; He whom I serve is richer than all the kings of this
world, and has their dominions.’</p>
<p>‘What then shall I give thee,’ he cried, ‘if thy price be
neither gold nor silver?’</p>
<p>The Witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand.&#160; ‘Thou
must dance with me, pretty boy,’ she murmured, and she smiled at
him as she spoke.</p>
<p>‘Nought but that?’ cried the young Fisherman in wonder and he
rose to his feet.</p>
<p>‘Nought but that,’ she answered, and she smiled at him
again.</p>
<p>‘Then at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together,’
he said, ‘and after that we have danced thou shalt tell me the
thing which I desire to know.’</p>
<p>She shook her head.&#160; ‘When the moon is full, when the moon
is full,’ she muttered.&#160; Then she peered all round, and
listened.&#160; A blue bird rose screaming from its nest and
circled over the dunes, and three spotted birds rustled through the
coarse grey grass and whistled to each other.&#160; There was no
other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth pebbles
below.&#160; So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her
and put her dry lips close to his ear.</p>
<p>‘To-night thou must come to the top of the mountain,’ she
whispered.&#160; ‘It is a Sabbath, and He will be there.’</p>
<p>The young Fisherman started and looked at her, and she showed
her white teeth and laughed.&#160; ‘Who is He of whom thou
speakest?’ he asked.</p>
<p>‘It matters not,’ she answered.&#160; ‘Go thou to-night, and
stand under the branches of the hornbeam, and wait for my
coming.&#160; If a black dog run towards thee, strike it with a rod
of willow, and it will go away.&#160; If an owl speak to thee, make
it no answer.&#160; When the moon is full I shall be with thee, and
we will dance together on the grass.’</p>
<p>‘But wilt thou swear to me to tell me how I may send my soul
from me?’ he made question.</p>
<p>She moved out into the sunlight, and through her red hair
rippled the wind.&#160; ‘By the hoofs of the goat I swear it,’ she
made answer.</p>
<p>‘Thou art the best of the witches,’ cried the young Fisherman,
‘and I will surely dance with thee to-night on the top of the
mountain.&#160; I would indeed that thou hadst asked of me either
gold or silver.&#160; But such as thy price is thou shalt have it,
for it is but a little thing.’&#160; And he doffed his cap to her,
and bent his head low, and ran back to the town filled with a great
joy.</p>
<p>And the Witch watched him as he went, and when he had passed
from her sight she entered her cave, and having taken a mirror from
a box of carved cedarwood, she set it up on a frame, and burned
vervain on lighted charcoal before it, and peered through the coils
of the smoke.&#160; And after a time she clenched her hands in
anger.&#160; ‘He should have been mine,’ she muttered, ‘I am as
fair as she is.’</p>
<p>And that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman
climbed up to the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches
of the hornbeam.&#160; Like a targe of polished metal the round sea
lay at his feet, and the shadows of the fishing-boats moved in the
little bay.&#160; A great owl, with yellow sulphurous eyes, called
to him by his name, but he made it no answer.&#160; A black dog ran
towards him and snarled.&#160; He struck it with a rod of willow,
and it went away whining.</p>
<p>At midnight the witches came flying through the air like
bats.&#160; ‘Phew!’ they cried, as they lit upon the ground, ‘there
is some one here we know not!’ and they sniffed about, and
chattered to each other, and made signs.&#160; Last of all came the
young Witch, with her red hair streaming in the wind.&#160; She
wore a dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks’ eyes, and a
little cap of green velvet was on her head.</p>
<p>‘Where is he, where is he?’ shrieked the witches when they saw
her, but she only laughed, and ran to the hornbeam, and taking the
Fisherman by the hand she led him out into the moonlight and began
to dance.</p>
<p>Round and round they whirled, and the young Witch jumped so high
that he could see the scarlet heels of her shoes.&#160; Then right
across the dancers came the sound of the galloping of a horse, but
no horse was to be seen, and he felt afraid.</p>
<p>‘Faster,’ cried the Witch, and she threw her arms about his
neck, and her breath was hot upon his face.&#160; ‘Faster, faster!’
she cried, and the earth seemed to spin beneath his feet, and his
brain grew troubled, and a great terror fell on him, as of some
evil thing that was watching him, and at last he became aware that
under the shadow of a rock there was a figure that had not been
there before.</p>
<p>It was a man dressed in a suit of black velvet, cut in the
Spanish fashion.&#160; His face was strangely pale, but his lips
were like a proud red flower.&#160; He seemed weary, and was
leaning back toying in a listless manner with the pommel of his
dagger.&#160; On the grass beside him lay a plumed hat, and a pair
of riding-gloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and sewn with
seed-pearls wrought into a curious device.&#160; A short cloak
lined with sables hang from his shoulder, and his delicate white
hands were gemmed with rings.&#160; Heavy eyelids drooped over his
eyes.</p>
<p>The young Fisherman watched him, as one snared in a spell.&#160;
At last their eyes met, and wherever he danced it seemed to him
that the eyes of the man were upon him.&#160; He heard the Witch
laugh, and caught her by the waist, and whirled her madly round and
round.</p>
<p>Suddenly a dog bayed in the wood, and the dancers stopped, and
going up two by two, knelt down, and kissed the man’s hands.&#160;
As they did so, a little smile touched his proud lips, as a bird’s
wing touches the water and makes it laugh.&#160; But there was
disdain in it.&#160; He kept looking at the young Fisherman.</p>
<p>‘Come! let us worship,’ whispered the Witch, and she led him up,
and a great desire to do as she besought him seized on him, and he
followed her.&#160; But when he came close, and without knowing why
he did it, he made on his breast the sign of the Cross, and called
upon the holy name.</p>
<p>No sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks
and flew away, and the pallid face that had been watching him
twitched with a spasm of pain.&#160; The man went over to a little
wood, and whistled.&#160; A jennet with silver trappings came
running to meet him.&#160; As he leapt upon the saddle he turned
round, and looked at the young Fisherman sadly.</p>
<p>And the Witch with the red hair tried to fly away also, but the
Fisherman caught her by her wrists, and held her fast.</p>
<p>‘Loose me,’ she cried, ‘and let me go.&#160; For thou hast named
what should not be named, and shown the sign that may not be looked
at.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ he answered, ‘but I will not let thee go till thou hast
told me the secret.’</p>
<p>‘What secret?’ said the Witch, wrestling with him like a wild
cat, and biting her foam-flecked lips.</p>
<p>‘Thou knowest,’ he made answer.</p>
<p>Her grass-green eyes grew dim with tears, and she said to the
Fisherman, ‘Ask me anything but that!’</p>
<p>He laughed, and held her all the more tightly.</p>
<p>And when she saw that she could not free herself, she whispered
to him, ‘Surely I am as fair as the daughters of the sea, and as
comely as those that dwell in the blue waters,’ and she fawned on
him and put her face close to his.</p>
<p>But he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, ‘If thou
keepest not the promise that thou madest to me I will slay thee for
a false witch.’</p>
<p>&#160;She grew grey as a blossom of the Judas tree, and
shuddered.&#160; ‘Be it so,’ she muttered.&#160; ‘It is thy soul
and not mine.&#160; Do with it as thou wilt.’&#160; And she took
from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green viper’s
skin, and gave it to him.</p>
<p>‘What shall this serve me?’ he asked of her, wondering.</p>
<p>She was silent for a few moments, and a look of terror came over
her face.&#160; Then she brushed her hair back from her forehead,
and smiling strangely she said to him, ‘What men call the shadow of
the body is not the shadow of the body, but is the body of the
soul.&#160; Stand on the sea-shore with thy back to the moon, and
cut away from around thy feet thy shadow, which is thy soul’s body,
and bid thy soul leave thee, and it will do so.’</p>
<p>The young Fisherman trembled.&#160; ‘Is this true?’ he
murmured.</p>
<p>‘It is true, and I would that I had not told thee of it,’ she
cried, and she clung to his knees weeping.</p>
<p>He put her from him and left her in the rank grass, and going to
the edge of the mountain he placed the knife in his belt and began
to climb down.</p>
<p>And his Soul that was within him called out to him and said,
‘Lo!&#160; I have dwelt with thee for all these years, and have
been thy servant.&#160; Send me not away from thee now, for what
evil have I done thee?’</p>
<p>And the young Fisherman laughed.&#160; ‘Thou hast done me no
evil, but I have no need of thee,’ he answered.&#160; ‘The world is
wide, and there is Heaven also, and Hell, and that dim twilight
house that lies between.&#160; Go wherever thou wilt, but trouble
me not, for my love is calling to me.’</p>
<p>And his Soul besought him piteously, but he heeded it not, but
leapt from crag to crag, being sure-footed as a wild goat, and at
last he reached the level ground and the yellow shore of the
sea.</p>
<p>Bronze-limbed and well-knit, like a statue wrought by a Grecian,
he stood on the sand with his back to the moon, and out of the foam
came white arms that beckoned to him, and out of the waves rose dim
forms that did him homage.&#160; Before him lay his shadow, which
was the body of his soul, and behind him hung the moon in the
honey-coloured air.</p>
<p>And his Soul said to him, ‘If indeed thou must drive me from
thee, send me not forth without a heart.&#160; The world is cruel,
give me thy heart to take with me.’</p>
<p>He tossed his head and smiled.&#160; ‘With what should I love my
love if I gave thee my heart?’ he cried.</p>
<p>‘Nay, but be merciful,’ said his Soul: ‘give me thy heart, for
the world is very cruel, and I am afraid.’</p>
<p>‘My heart is my love’s,’ he answered, ‘therefore tarry not, but
get thee gone.’</p>
<p>‘Should I not love also?’ asked his Soul.</p>
<p>‘Get thee gone, for I have no need of thee,’ cried the young
Fisherman, and he took the little knife with its handle of green
viper’s skin, and cut away his shadow from around his feet, and it
rose up and stood before him, and looked at him, and it was even as
himself.</p>
<p>He crept back, and thrust the knife into his belt, and a feeling
of awe came over him.&#160; ‘Get thee gone,’ he murmured, ‘and let
me see thy face no more.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, but we must meet again,’ said the Soul.&#160; Its voice
was low and flute-like, and its lips hardly moved while it
spake.</p>
<p>‘How shall we meet?’ cried the young Fisherman.&#160; ‘Thou wilt
not follow me into the depths of the sea?’</p>
<p>‘Once every year I will come to this place, and call to thee,’
said the Soul.&#160; ‘It may be that thou wilt have need of
me.’</p>
<p>‘What need should I have of thee?’ cried the young Fisherman,
‘but be it as thou wilt,’ and he plunged into the waters and the
Tritons blew their horns and the little Mermaid rose up to meet
him, and put her arms around his neck and kissed him on the
mouth.</p>
<p>And the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them.&#160;
And when they had sunk down into the sea, it went weeping away over
the marshes.</p>
<p>And after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the
sea and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep,
and said, ‘Why dost thou call to me?’</p>
<p>And the Soul answered, ‘Come nearer, that I may speak with thee,
for I have seen marvellous things.’</p>
<p>So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned
his head upon his hand and listened.</p>
<p>And the Soul said to him, ‘When I left thee I turned my face to
the East and journeyed.&#160; From the East cometh everything that
is wise.&#160; Six days I journeyed, and on the morning of the
seventh day I came to a hill that is in the country of the
Tartars.&#160; I sat down under the shade of a tamarisk tree to
shelter myself from the sun.&#160; The land was dry and burnt up
with the heat.&#160; The people went to and fro over the plain like
flies crawling upon a disk of polished copper.</p>
<p>‘When it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim
of the land.&#160; When the Tartars saw it, they strung their
painted bows, and having leapt upon their little horses they
galloped to meet it.&#160; The women fled screaming to the waggons,
and hid themselves behind the felt curtains.</p>
<p>‘At twilight the Tartars returned, but five of them were
missing, and of those that came back not a few had been
wounded.&#160; They harnessed their horses to the waggons and drove
hastily away.&#160; Three jackals came out of a cave and peered
after them.&#160; Then they sniffed up the air with their nostrils,
and trotted off in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>‘When the moon rose I saw a camp-fire burning on the plain, and
went towards it.&#160; A company of merchants were seated round it
on carpets.&#160; Their camels were picketed behind them, and the
negroes who were their servants were pitching tents of tanned skin
upon the sand, and making a high wall of the prickly pear.</p>
<p>‘As I came near them, the chief of the merchants rose up and
drew his sword, and asked me my business.</p>
<p>‘I answered that I was a Prince in my own land, and that I had
escaped from the Tartars, who had sought to make me their
slave.&#160; The chief smiled, and showed me five heads fixed upon
long reeds of bamboo.</p>
<p>‘Then he asked me who was the prophet of God, and I answered him
Mohammed.</p>
<p>‘When he heard the name of the false prophet, he bowed and took
me by the hand, and placed me by his side.&#160; A negro brought me
some mare’s milk in a wooden dish, and a piece of lamb’s flesh
roasted.</p>
<p>‘At daybreak we started on our journey.&#160; I rode on a
red-haired camel by the side of the chief, and a runner ran before
us carrying a spear.&#160; The men of war were on either hand, and
the mules followed with the merchandise.&#160; There were forty
camels in the caravan, and the mules were twice forty in
number.</p>
<p>‘We went from the country of the Tartars into the country of
those who curse the Moon.&#160; We saw the Gryphons guarding their
gold on the white rocks, and the scaled Dragons sleeping in their
caves.&#160; As we passed over the mountains we held our breath
lest the snows might fall on us, and each man tied a veil of gauze
before his eyes.&#160; As we passed through the valleys the Pygmies
shot arrows at us from the hollows of the trees, and at night-time
we heard the wild men beating on their drums.&#160; When we came to
the Tower of Apes we set fruits before them, and they did not harm
us.&#160; When we came to the Tower of Serpents we gave them warm
milk in howls of brass, and they let us go by.&#160; Three times in
our journey we came to the banks of the Oxus.&#160; We crossed it
on rafts of wood with great bladders of blown hide.&#160; The
river-horses raged against us and sought to slay us.&#160; When the
camels saw them they trembled.</p>
<p>‘The kings of each city levied tolls on us, but would not suffer
us to enter their gates.&#160; They threw us bread over the walls,
little maize-cakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled
with dates.&#160; For every hundred baskets we gave them a bead of
amber.</p>
<p>‘When the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned
the wells and fled to the hill-summits.&#160; We fought with the
Magadae who are born old, and grow younger and younger every year,
and die when they are little children; and with the Laktroi who say
that they are the sons of tigers, and paint themselves yellow and
black; and with the Aurantes who bury their dead on the tops of
trees, and themselves live in dark caverns lest the Sun, who is
their god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians who worship a
crocodile, and give it earrings of green glass, and feed it with
butter and fresh fowls; and with the Agazonbae, who are dog-faced;
and with the Sibans, who have horses’ feet, and run more swiftly
than horses.&#160; A third of our company died in battle, and a
third died of want.&#160; The rest murmured against me, and said
that I had brought them an evil fortune.&#160; I took a horned
adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me.&#160; When they saw
that I did not sicken they grew afraid.</p>
<p>‘In the fourth month we reached the city of Illel.&#160; It was
night-time when we came to the grove that is outside the walls, and
the air was sultry, for the Moon was travelling in Scorpion.&#160;
We took the ripe pomegranates from the trees, and brake them, and
drank their sweet juices.&#160; Then we lay down on our carpets,
and waited for the dawn.</p>
<p>‘And at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city.&#160;
It was wrought out of red bronze, and carved with sea-dragons and
dragons that have wings.&#160; The guards looked down from the
battlements and asked us our business.&#160; The interpreter of the
caravan answered that we had come from the island of Syria with
much merchandise.&#160; They took hostages, and told us that they
would open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till then.</p>
<p>‘When it was noon they opened the gate, and as we entered in the
people came crowding out of the houses to look at us, and a crier
went round the city crying through a shell.&#160; We stood in the
market-place, and the negroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths
and opened the carved chests of sycamore.&#160; And when they had
ended their task, the merchants set forth their strange wares, the
waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen from the country of
the Ethiops, the purple sponges from Tyre and the blue hangings
from Sidon, the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of glass
and the curious vessels of burnt clay.&#160; From the roof of a
house a company of women watched us.&#160; One of them wore a mask
of gilded leather.</p>
<p>‘And on the first day the priests came and bartered with us, and
on the second day came the nobles, and on the third day came the
craftsmen and the slaves.&#160; And this is their custom with all
merchants as long as they tarry in the city.</p>
<p>‘And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I
wearied and wandered away through the streets of the city and came
to the garden of its god.&#160; The priests in their yellow robes
moved silently through the green trees, and on a pavement of black
marble stood the rose-red house in which the god had his
dwelling.&#160; Its doors were of powdered lacquer, and bulls and
peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold.&#160;
The tilted roof was of sea-green porcelain, and the jutting eaves
were festooned with little bells.&#160; When the white doves flew
past, they struck the bells with their wings and made them
tinkle.</p>
<p>‘In front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with
veined onyx.&#160; I lay down beside it, and with my pale fingers I
touched the broad leaves.&#160; One of the priests came towards me
and stood behind me.&#160; He had sandals on his feet, one of soft
serpent-skin and the other of birds’ plumage.&#160; On his head was
a mitre of black felt decorated with silver crescents.&#160; Seven
yellows were woven into his robe, and his frizzed hair was stained
with antimony.</p>
<p>‘After a little while he spake to me, and asked me my
desire.</p>
<p>‘I told him that my desire was to see the god.</p>
<p>‘“The god is hunting,” said the priest, looking strangely at me
with his small slanting eyes.</p>
<p>‘“Tell me in what forest, and I will ride with him,” I
answered.</p>
<p>‘He combed out the soft fringes of his tunic with his long
pointed nails.&#160; “The god is asleep,” he murmured.</p>
<p>‘“Tell me on what couch, and I will watch by him,” I
answered.</p>
<p>‘“The god is at the feast,” he cried.</p>
<p>‘“If the wine be sweet I will drink it with him, and if it be
bitter I will drink it with him also,” was my answer.</p>
<p>‘He bowed his head in wonder, and, taking me by the hand, he
raised me up, and led me into the temple.</p>
<p>‘And in the first chamber I saw an idol seated on a throne of
jasper bordered with great orient pearls.&#160; It was carved out
of ebony, and in stature was of the stature of a man.&#160; On its
forehead was a ruby, and thick oil dripped from its hair on to its
thighs.&#160; Its feet were red with the blood of a newly-slain
kid, and its loins girt with a copper belt that was studded with
seven beryls.</p>
<p>‘And I said to the priest, “Is this the god?”&#160; And he
answered me, “This is the god.”</p>
<p>‘“Show me the god,” I cried, “or I will surely slay thee.”&#160;
And I touched his hand, and it became withered.</p>
<p>‘And the priest besought me, saying, “Let my lord heal his
servant, and I will show him the god.”</p>
<p>‘So I breathed with my breath upon his hand, and it became whole
again, and he trembled and led me into the second chamber, and I
saw an idol standing on a lotus of jade hung with great
emeralds.&#160; It was carved out of ivory, and in stature was
twice the stature of a man.&#160; On its forehead was a chrysolite,
and its breasts were smeared with myrrh and cinnamon.&#160; In one
hand it held a crooked sceptre of jade, and in the other a round
crystal.&#160; It ware buskins of brass, and its thick neck was
circled with a circle of selenites.</p>
<p>‘And I said to the priest, “Is this the god?”</p>
<p>‘And he answered me, “This is the god.”</p>
<p>‘“Show me the god,” I cried, “or I will surely slay thee.”&#160;
And I touched his eyes, and they became blind.</p>
<p>‘And the priest besought me, saying, “Let my lord heal his
servant, and I will show him the god.”</p>
<p>‘So I breathed with my breath upon his eyes, and the sight came
back to them, and he trembled again, and led me into the third
chamber, and lo! there was no idol in it, nor image of any kind,
but only a mirror of round metal set on an altar of stone.</p>
<p>‘And I said to the priest, “Where is the god?”</p>
<p>‘And he answered me: “There is no god but this mirror that thou
seest, for this is the Mirror of Wisdom.&#160; And it reflecteth
all things that are in heaven and on earth, save only the face of
him who looketh into it.&#160; This it reflecteth not, so that he
who looketh into it may be wise.&#160; Many other mirrors are
there, but they are mirrors of Opinion.&#160; This only is the
Mirror of Wisdom.&#160; And they who possess this mirror know
everything, nor is there anything hidden from them.&#160; And they
who possess it not have not Wisdom.&#160; Therefore is it the god,
and we worship it.”&#160; And I looked into the mirror, and it was
even as he had said to me.</p>
<p>‘And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a
valley that is but a day’s journey from this place have I hidden
the Mirror of Wisdom.&#160; Do but suffer me to enter into thee
again and be thy servant, and thou shalt be wiser than all the wise
men, and Wisdom shall be thine.&#160; Suffer me to enter into thee,
and none will be as wise as thou.’</p>
<p>But the young Fisherman laughed.&#160; ‘Love is better than
Wisdom,’ he cried, ‘and the little Mermaid loves me.’</p>
<p><em>‘</em>Nay, but there is nothing better than Wisdom,’ said
the Soul.</p>
<p>‘Love is better,’ answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged
into the deep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.</p>
<p>And after the second year was over, the Soul came down to the
shore of the sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose
out of the deep and said, ‘Why dost thou call to me?’</p>
<p>And the Soul answered, ‘Come nearer, that I may speak with thee,
for I have seen marvellous things.’</p>
<p>So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned
his head upon his hand and listened.</p>
<p>And the Soul said to him, ‘When I left thee, I turned my face to
the South and journeyed.&#160; From the South cometh everything
that is precious.&#160; Six days I journeyed along the highways
that lead to the city of Ashter, along the dusty red-dyed highways
by which the pilgrims are wont to go did I journey, and on the
morning of the seventh day I lifted up my eyes, and lo! the city
lay at my feet, for it is in a valley.</p>
<p>‘There are nine gates to this city, and in front of each gate
stands a bronze horse that neighs when the Bedouins come down from
the mountains.&#160; The walls are cased with copper, and the
watch-towers on the walls are roofed with brass.&#160; In every
tower stands an archer with a bow in his hand.&#160; At sunrise he
strikes with an arrow on a gong, and at sunset he blows through a
horn of horn.</p>
<p>‘When I sought to enter, the guards stopped me and asked of me
who I was.&#160; I made answer that I was a Dervish and on my way
to the city of Mecca, where there was a green veil on which the
Koran was embroidered in silver letters by the hands of the
angels.&#160; They were filled with wonder, and entreated me to
pass in.</p>
<p>‘Inside it is even as a bazaar.&#160; Surely thou shouldst have
been with me.&#160; Across the narrow streets the gay lanterns of
paper flutter like large butterflies.&#160; When the wind blows
over the roofs they rise and fall as painted bubbles do.&#160; In
front of their booths sit the merchants on silken carpets.&#160;
They have straight black beards, and their turbans are covered with
golden sequins, and long strings of amber and carved peach-stones
glide through their cool fingers.&#160; Some of them sell galbanum
and nard, and curious perfumes from the islands of the Indian Sea,
and the thick oil of red roses, and myrrh and little nail-shaped
cloves.&#160; When one stops to speak to them, they throw pinches
of frankincense upon a charcoal brazier and make the air
sweet.&#160; I saw a Syrian who held in his hands a thin rod like a
reed.&#160; Grey threads of smoke came from it, and its odour as it
burned was as the odour of the pink almond in spring.&#160; Others
sell silver bracelets embossed all over with creamy blue turquoise
stones, and anklets of brass wire fringed with little pearls, and
tigers’ claws set in gold, and the claws of that gilt cat, the
leopard, set in gold also, and earrings of pierced emerald, and
finger-rings of hollowed jade.&#160; From the tea-houses comes the
sound of the guitar, and the opium-smokers with their white smiling
faces look out at the passers-by.</p>
<p>‘Of a truth thou shouldst have been with me.&#160; The
wine-sellers elbow their way through the crowd with great black
skins on their shoulders.&#160; Most of them sell the wine of
Schiraz, which is as sweet as honey.&#160; They serve it in little
metal cups and strew rose leaves upon it.&#160; In the market-place
stand the fruitsellers, who sell all kinds of fruit: ripe figs,
with their bruised purple flesh, melons, smelling of musk and
yellow as topazes, citrons and rose-apples and clusters of white
grapes, round red-gold oranges, and oval lemons of green
gold.&#160; Once I saw an elephant go by.&#160; Its trunk was
painted with vermilion and turmeric, and over its ears it had a net
of crimson silk cord.&#160; It stopped opposite one of the booths
and began eating the oranges, and the man only laughed.&#160; Thou
canst not think how strange a people they are.&#160; When they are
glad they go to the bird-sellers and buy of them a caged bird, and
set it free that their joy may be greater, and when they are sad
they scourge themselves with thorns that their sorrow may not grow
less.</p>
<p>‘One evening I met some negroes carrying a heavy palanquin
through the bazaar.&#160; It was made of gilded bamboo, and the
poles were of vermilion lacquer studded with brass peacocks.&#160;
Across the windows hung thin curtains of muslin embroidered with
beetles’ wings and with tiny seed-pearls, and as it passed by a
pale-faced Circassian looked out and smiled at me.&#160; I followed
behind, and the negroes hurried their steps and scowled.&#160; But
I did not care.&#160; I felt a great curiosity come over me.</p>
<p>‘At last they stopped at a square white house.&#160; There were
no windows to it, only a little door like the door of a tomb.&#160;
They set down the palanquin and knocked three times with a copper
hammer.&#160; An Armenian in a caftan of green leather peered
through the wicket, and when he saw them he opened, and spread a
carpet on the ground, and the woman stepped out.&#160; As she went
in, she turned round and smiled at me again.&#160; I had never seen
any one so pale.</p>
<p>‘When the moon rose I returned to the same place and sought for
the house, but it was no longer there.&#160; When I saw that, I
knew who the woman was, and wherefore she had smiled at me.</p>
<p>‘Certainly thou shouldst have been with me.&#160; On the feast
of the New Moon the young Emperor came forth from his palace and
went into the mosque to pray.&#160; His hair and beard were dyed
with rose-leaves, and his cheeks were powdered with a fine gold
dust.&#160; The palms of his feet and hands were yellow with
saffron.</p>
<p>‘At sunrise he went forth from his palace in a robe of silver,
and at sunset he returned to it again in a robe of gold.&#160; The
people flung themselves on the ground and hid their faces, but I
would not do so.&#160; I stood by the stall of a seller of dates
and waited.&#160; When the Emperor saw me, he raised his painted
eyebrows and stopped.&#160; I stood quite still, and made him no
obeisance.&#160; The people marvelled at my boldness, and
counselled me to flee from the city.&#160; I paid no heed to them,
but went and sat with the sellers of strange gods, who by reason of
their craft are abominated.&#160; When I told them what I had done,
each of them gave me a god and prayed me to leave them.</p>
<p>‘That night, as I lay on a cushion in the tea-house that is in
the Street of Pomegranates, the guards of the Emperor entered and
led me to the palace.&#160; As I went in they closed each door
behind me, and put a chain across it.&#160; Inside was a great
court with an arcade running all round.&#160; The walls were of
white alabaster, set here and there with blue and green
tiles.&#160; The pillars were of green marble, and the pavement of
a kind of peach-blossom marble.&#160; I had never seen anything
like it before.</p>
<p>‘As I passed across the court two veiled women looked down from
a balcony and cursed me.&#160; The guards hastened on, and the
butts of the lances rang upon the polished floor.&#160; They opened
a gate of wrought ivory, and I found myself in a watered garden of
seven terraces.&#160; It was planted with tulip-cups and
moonflowers, and silver-studded aloes.&#160; Like a slim reed of
crystal a fountain hung in the dusky air.&#160; The cypress-trees
were like burnt-out torches.&#160; From one of them a nightingale
was singing.</p>
<p>‘At the end of the garden stood a little pavilion.&#160; As we
approached it two eunuchs came out to meet us.&#160; Their fat
bodies swayed as they walked, and they glanced curiously at me with
their yellow-lidded eyes.&#160; One of them drew aside the captain
of the guard, and in a low voice whispered to him.&#160; The other
kept munching scented pastilles, which he took with an affected
gesture out of an oval box of lilac enamel.</p>
<p>‘After a few moments the captain of the guard dismissed the
soldiers.&#160; They went back to the palace, the eunuchs following
slowly behind and plucking the sweet mulberries from the trees as
they passed.&#160; Once the elder of the two turned round, and
smiled at me with an evil smile.</p>
<p>‘Then the captain of the guard motioned me towards the entrance
of the pavilion.&#160; I walked on without trembling, and drawing
the heavy curtain aside I entered in.</p>
<p>‘The young Emperor was stretched on a couch of dyed lion skins,
and a gerfalcon perched upon his wrist.&#160; Behind him stood a
brass-turbaned Nubian, naked down to the waist, and with heavy
earrings in his split ears.&#160; On a table by the side of the
couch lay a mighty scimitar of steel.</p>
<p>‘When the Emperor saw me he frowned, and said to me, “What is
thy name?&#160; Knowest thou not that I am Emperor of this
city?”&#160; But I made him no answer.</p>
<p>‘He pointed with his finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian
seized it, and rushing forward struck at me with great
violence.&#160; The blade whizzed through me, and did me no
hurt.&#160; The man fell sprawling on the floor, and when he rose
up his teeth chattered with terror and he hid himself behind the
couch.</p>
<p>‘The Emperor leapt to his feet, and taking a lance from a stand
of arms, he threw it at me.&#160; I caught it in its flight, and
brake the shaft into two pieces.&#160; He shot at me with an arrow,
but I held up my hands and it stopped in mid-air.&#160; Then he
drew a dagger from a belt of white leather, and stabbed the Nubian
in the throat lest the slave should tell of his dishonour.&#160;
The man writhed like a trampled snake, and a red foam bubbled from
his lips.</p>
<p>‘As soon as he was dead the Emperor turned to me, and when he
had wiped away the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin
of purfled and purple silk, he said to me, “Art thou a prophet,
that I may not harm thee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do
thee no hurt?&#160; I pray thee leave my city to-night, for while
thou art in it I am no longer its lord.”</p>
<p>‘And I answered him, “I will go for half of thy treasure.&#160;
Give me half of thy treasure, and I will go away.”</p>
<p>‘He took me by the hand, and led me out into the garden.&#160;
When the captain of the guard saw me, he wondered.&#160; When the
eunuchs saw me, their knees shook and they fell upon the ground in
fear.</p>
<p>‘There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red
porphyry, and a brass-sealed ceiling hung with lamps.&#160; The
Emperor touched one of the walls and it opened, and we passed down
a corridor that was lit with many torches.&#160; In niches upon
each side stood great wine-jars filled to the brim with silver
pieces.&#160; When we reached the centre of the corridor the
Emperor spake the word that may not be spoken, and a granite door
swung back on a secret spring, and he put his hands before his face
lest his eyes should be dazzled.</p>
<p>‘Thou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was.&#160;
There were huge tortoise-shells full of pearls, and hollowed
moonstones of great size piled up with red rubies.&#160; The gold
was stored in coffers of elephant-hide, and the gold-dust in
leather bottles.&#160; There were opals and sapphires, the former
in cups of crystal, and the latter in cups of jade.&#160; Round
green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of ivory, and
in one corner were silk bags filled, some with turquoise-stones,
and others with beryls.&#160; The ivory horns were heaped with
purple amethysts, and the horns of brass with chalcedonies and
sards.&#160; The pillars, which were of cedar, were hung with
strings of yellow lynx-stones.&#160; In the flat oval shields there
were carbuncles, both wine-coloured and coloured like grass.&#160;
And yet I have told thee but a tithe of what was there.</p>
<p>‘And when the Emperor had taken away his hands from before his
face he said to me: “This is my house of treasure, and half that is
in it is thine, even as I promised to thee.&#160; And I will give
thee camels and camel drivers, and they shall do thy bidding and
take thy share of the treasure to whatever part of the world thou
desirest to go.&#160; And the thing shall be done to-night, for I
would not that the Sun, who is my father, should see that there is
in my city a man whom I cannot slay.”</p>
<p>‘But I answered him, “The gold that is here is thine, and the
silver also is thine, and thine are the precious jewels and the
things of price.&#160; As for me, I have no need of these.&#160;
Nor shall I take aught from thee but that little ring that thou
wearest on the finger of thy hand.”</p>
<p>‘And the Emperor frowned.&#160; “It is but a ring of lead,” he
cried, “nor has it any value.&#160; Therefore take thy half of the
treasure and go from my city.”</p>
<p>‘“Nay,” I answered, “but I will take nought but that leaden
ring, for I know what is written within it, and for what
purpose.”</p>
<p>‘And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, “Take all
the treasure and go from my city.&#160; The half that is mine shall
be thine also.”</p>
<p>‘And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a
cave that is but a day’s journey from this place have, I hidden the
Ring of Riches.&#160; It is but a day’s journey from this place,
and it waits for thy coming.&#160; He who has this Ring is richer
than all the kings of the world.&#160; Come therefore and take it,
and the world’s riches shall be thine.’</p>
<p>But the young Fisherman laughed.&#160; ‘Love is better than
Riches,’ he cried, ‘and the little Mermaid loves me.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, but there is nothing better than Riches,’ said the
Soul.</p>
<p>‘Love is better,’ answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged
into the deep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.</p>
<p>And after the third year was over, the Soul came down to the
shore of the sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose
out of the deep and said, ‘Why dost thou call to me?’</p>
<p>And the Soul answered, ‘Come nearer, that I may speak with thee,
for I have seen marvellous things.’</p>
<p>So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned
his head upon his hand and listened.</p>
<p>And the Soul said to him, ‘In a city that I know of there is an
inn that standeth by a river.&#160; I sat there with sailors who
drank of two different-coloured wines, and ate bread made of
barley, and little salt fish served in bay leaves with
vinegar.&#160; And as we sat and made merry, there entered to us an
old man bearing a leathern carpet and a lute that had two horns of
amber.&#160; And when he had laid out the carpet on the floor, he
struck with a quill on the wire strings of his lute, and a girl
whose face was veiled ran in and began to dance before us.&#160;
Her face was veiled with a veil of gauze, but her feet were
naked.&#160; Naked were her feet, and they moved over the carpet
like little white pigeons.&#160; Never have I seen anything so
marvellous; and the city in which she dances is but a day’s journey
from this place.’</p>
<p>Now when the young Fisherman heard the words of his Soul, he
remembered that the little Mermaid had no feet and could not
dance.&#160; And a great desire came over him, and he said to
himself, ‘It is but a day’s journey, and I can return to my love,’
and he laughed, and stood up in the shallow water, and strode
towards the shore.</p>
<p>And when he had reached the dry shore he laughed again, and held
out his arms to his Soul.&#160; And his Soul gave a great cry of
joy and ran to meet him, and entered into him, and the young
Fisherman saw stretched before him upon the sand that shadow of the
body that is the body of the Soul.</p>
<p>And his Soul said to him, ‘Let us not tarry, but get hence at
once, for the Sea-gods are jealous, and have monsters that do their
bidding.’</p>
<p>So they made haste, and all that night they journeyed beneath
the moon, and all the next day they journeyed beneath the sun, and
on the evening of the day they came to a city.</p>
<p>And the young Fisherman said to his Soul, ‘Is this the city in
which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me?’</p>
<p>And his Soul answered him, ‘It is not this city, but
another.&#160; Nevertheless let us enter in.’&#160; So they entered
in and passed through the streets, and as they passed through the
Street of the Jewellers the young Fisherman saw a fair silver cup
set forth in a booth.&#160; And his Soul said to him, ‘Take that
silver cup and hide it.’</p>
<p>So he took the cup and hid it in the fold of his tunic, and they
went hurriedly out of the city.</p>
<p>And after that they had gone a league from the city, the young
Fisherman frowned, and flung the cup away, and said to his Soul,
‘Why didst thou tell me to take this cup and hide it, for it was an
evil thing to do?’</p>
<p>But his Soul answered him, ‘Be at peace, be at peace.’</p>
<p>And on the evening of the second day they came to a city, and
the young Fisherman said to his Soul, ‘Is this the city in which
she dances of whom thou didst speak to me?’</p>
<p>And his Soul answered him, ‘It is not this city, but
another.&#160; Nevertheless let us enter in.’&#160; So they entered
in and passed through the streets, and as they passed through the
Street of the Sellers of Sandals, the young Fisherman saw a child
standing by a jar of water.&#160; And his Soul said to him, ‘Smite
that child.’&#160; So he smote the child till it wept, and when he
had done this they went hurriedly out of the city.</p>
<p>And after that they had gone a league from the city the young
Fisherman grew wroth, and said to his Soul, ‘Why didst thou tell me
to smite the child, for it was an evil thing to do?’</p>
<p>But his Soul answered him, ‘Be at peace, be at peace.’</p>
<p>And on the evening of the third day they came to a city, and the
young Fisherman said to his Soul, ‘Is this the city in which she
dances of whom thou didst speak to me?’</p>
<p>And his Soul answered him, ‘It may be that it is in this city,
therefore let us enter in.’</p>
<p>So they entered in and passed through the streets, but nowhere
could the young Fisherman find the river or the inn that stood by
its side.&#160; And the people of the city looked curiously at him,
and he grew afraid and said to his Soul, ‘Let us go hence, for she
who dances with white feet is not here.’</p>
<p>But his Soul answered, ‘Nay, but let us tarry, for the night is
dark and there will be robbers on the way.’</p>
<p>So he sat him down in the market-place and rested, and after a
time there went by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of
Tartary, and bare a lantern of pierced horn at the end of a jointed
reed.&#160; And the merchant said to him, ‘Why dost thou sit in the
market-place, seeing that the booths are closed and the bales
corded?’</p>
<p>And the young Fisherman answered him, ‘I can find no inn in this
city, nor have I any kinsman who might give me shelter.’</p>
<p>‘Are we not all kinsmen?’ said the merchant.&#160; ‘And did not
one God make us?&#160; Therefore come with me, for I have a
guest-chamber.’</p>
<p>So the young Fisherman rose up and followed the merchant to his
house.&#160; And when he had passed through a garden of
pomegranates and entered into the house, the merchant brought him
rose-water in a copper dish that he might wash his hands, and ripe
melons that he might quench his thirst, and set a bowl of rice and
a piece of roasted kid before him.</p>
<p>And after that he had finished, the merchant led him to the
guest-chamber, and bade him sleep and be at rest.&#160; And the
young Fisherman gave him thanks, and kissed the ring that was on
his hand, and flung himself down on the carpets of dyed
goat’s-hair.&#160; And when he had covered himself with a covering
of black lamb’s-wool he fell asleep.</p>
<p>And three hours before dawn, and while it was still night, his
Soul waked him and said to him, ‘Rise up and go to the room of the
merchant, even to the room in which he sleepeth, and slay him, and
take from him his gold, for we have need of it.’</p>
<p>And the young Fisherman rose up and crept towards the room of
the merchant, and over the feet of the merchant there was lying a
curved sword, and the tray by the side of the merchant held nine
purses of gold.&#160; And he reached out his hand and touched the
sword, and when he touched it the merchant started and awoke, and
leaping up seized himself the sword and cried to the young
Fisherman, ‘Dost thou return evil for good, and pay with the
shedding of blood for the kindness that I have shown thee?’</p>
<p>And his Soul said to the young Fisherman, ‘Strike him,’ and he
struck him so that he swooned and he seized then the nine purses of
gold, and fled hastily through the garden of pomegranates, and set
his face to the star that is the star of morning.</p>
<p>And when they had gone a league from the city, the young
Fisherman beat his breast, and said to his Soul, ‘Why didst thou
bid me slay the merchant and take his gold?&#160; Surely thou art
evil.’</p>
<p>But his Soul answered him, ‘Be at peace, be at peace.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘I may not be at peace, for
all that thou hast made me to do I hate.&#160; Thee also I hate,
and I bid thee tell me wherefore thou hast wrought with me in this
wise.’</p>
<p>And his Soul answered him, ‘When thou didst send me forth into
the world thou gavest me no heart, so I learned to do all these
things and love them.’</p>
<p>‘What sayest thou?’ murmured the young Fisherman.</p>
<p>‘Thou knowest,’ answered his Soul, ‘thou knowest it well.&#160;
Hast thou forgotten that thou gavest me no heart?&#160; I trow
not.&#160; And so trouble not thyself nor me, but be at peace, for
there is no pain that thou shalt not give away, nor any pleasure
that thou shalt not receive.’</p>
<p>And when the young Fisherman heard these words he trembled and
said to his Soul, ‘Nay, but thou art evil, and hast made me forget
my love, and hast tempted me with temptations, and hast set my feet
in the ways of sin.’</p>
<p>And his Soul answered him, ‘Thou hast not forgotten that when
thou didst send me forth into the world thou gavest me no
heart.&#160; Come, let us go to another city, and make merry, for
we have nine purses of gold.’</p>
<p>But the young Fisherman took the nine purses of gold, and flung
them down, and trampled on them.</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ he cried, ‘but I will have nought to do with thee, nor
will I journey with thee anywhere, but even as I sent thee away
before, so will I send thee away now, for thou hast wrought me no
good.’&#160; And he turned his back to the moon, and with the
little knife that had the handle of green viper’s skin he strove to
cut from his feet that shadow of the body which is the body of the
Soul.</p>
<p>Yet his Soul stirred not from him, nor paid heed to his command,
but said to him, ‘The spell that the Witch told thee avails thee no
more, for I may not leave thee, nor mayest thou drive me
forth.&#160; Once in his life may a man send his Soul away, but he
who receiveth back his Soul must keep it with him for ever, and
this is his punishment and his reward.’</p>
<p>And the young Fisherman grew pale and clenched his hands and
cried, ‘She was a false Witch in that she told me not that.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ answered his Soul, ‘but she was true to Him she worships,
and whose servant she will be ever.’</p>
<p>And when the young Fisherman knew that he could no longer get
rid of his Soul, and that it was an evil Soul and would abide with
him always, he fell upon the ground weeping bitterly.</p>
<p>And when it was day the young Fisherman rose up and said to his
Soul, ‘I will bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, and
close my lips that I may not speak thy words, and I will return to
the place where she whom I love has her dwelling.&#160; Even to the
sea will I return, and to the little bay where she is wont to sing,
and I will call to her and tell her the evil I have done and the
evil thou hast wrought on me.’</p>
<p>And his Soul tempted him and said, ‘Who is thy love, that thou
shouldst return to her?&#160; The world has many fairer than she
is.&#160; There are the dancing-girls of Samaris who dance in the
manner of all kinds of birds and beasts.&#160; Their feet are
painted with henna, and in their hands they have little copper
bells.&#160; They laugh while they dance, and their laughter is as
clear as the laughter of water.&#160; Come with me and I will show
them to thee.&#160; For what is this trouble of thine about the
things of sin?&#160; Is that which is pleasant to eat not made for
the eater?&#160; Is there poison in that which is sweet to
drink?&#160; Trouble not thyself, but come with me to another
city.&#160; There is a little city hard by in which there is a
garden of tulip-trees.&#160; And there dwell in this comely garden
white peacocks and peacocks that have blue breasts.&#160; Their
tails when they spread them to the sun are like disks of ivory and
like gilt disks.&#160; And she who feeds them dances for their
pleasure, and sometimes she dances on her hands and at other times
she dances with her feet.&#160; Her eyes are coloured with stibium,
and her nostrils are shaped like the wings of a swallow.&#160; From
a hook in one of her nostrils hangs a flower that is carved out of
a pearl.&#160; She laughs while she dances, and the silver rings
that are about her ankles tinkle like bells of silver.&#160; And so
trouble not thyself any more, but come with me to this city.’</p>
<p>But the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but closed his
lips with the seal of silence and with a tight cord bound his
hands, and journeyed back to the place from which he had come, even
to the little bay where his love had been wont to sing.&#160; And
ever did his Soul tempt him by the way, but he made it no answer,
nor would he do any of the wickedness that it sought to make him to
do, so great was the power of the love that was within him.</p>
<p>And when he had reached the shore of the sea, he loosed the cord
from his hands, and took the seal of silence from his lips, and
called to the little Mermaid.&#160; But she came not to his call,
though he called to her all day long and besought her.</p>
<p>And his Soul mocked him and said, ‘Surely thou hast but little
joy out of thy love.&#160; Thou art as one who in time of death
pours water into a broken vessel.&#160; Thou givest away what thou
hast, and nought is given to thee in return.&#160; It were better
for thee to come with me, for I know where the Valley of Pleasure
lies, and what things are wrought there.’</p>
<p>But the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but in a cleft of
the rock he built himself a house of wattles, and abode there for
the space of a year.&#160; And every morning he called to the
Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night-time
he spake her name.&#160; Yet never did she rise out of the sea to
meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her though he
sought for her in the caves and in the green water, in the pools of
the tide and in the wells that are at the bottom of the deep.</p>
<p>And ever did his Soul tempt him with evil, and whisper of
terrible things.&#160; Yet did it not prevail against him, so great
was the power of his love.</p>
<p>And after the year was over, the Soul thought within himself, ‘I
have tempted my master with evil, and his love is stronger than I
am.&#160; I will tempt him now with good, and it may be that he
will come with me.’</p>
<p>So he spake to the young Fisherman and said, ‘I have told thee
of the joy of the world, and thou hast turned a deaf ear to
me.&#160; Suffer me now to tell thee of the world’s pain, and it
may be that thou wilt hearken.&#160; For of a truth pain is the
Lord of this world, nor is there any one who escapes from its
net.&#160; There be some who lack raiment, and others who lack
bread.&#160; There be widows who sit in purple, and widows who sit
in rags.&#160; To and fro over the fens go the lepers, and they are
cruel to each other.&#160; The beggars go up and down on the
highways, and their wallets are empty.&#160; Through the streets of
the cities walks Famine, and the Plague sits at their gates.&#160;
Come, let us go forth and mend these things, and make them not to
be.&#160; Wherefore shouldst thou tarry here calling to thy love,
seeing she comes not to thy call?&#160; And what is love, that thou
shouldst set this high store upon it?’</p>
<p>But the young Fisherman answered it nought, so great was the
power of his love.&#160; And every morning he called to the
Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night-time
he spake her name.&#160; Yet never did she rise out of the sea to
meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her, though he
sought for her in the rivers of the sea, and in the valleys that
are under the waves, in the sea that the night makes purple, and in
the sea that the dawn leaves grey.</p>
<p>And after the second year was over, the Soul said to the young
Fisherman at night-time, and as he sat in the wattled house alone,
‘Lo! now I have tempted thee with evil, and I have tempted thee
with good, and thy love is stronger than I am.&#160; Wherefore will
I tempt thee no longer, but I pray thee to suffer me to enter thy
heart, that I may be one with thee even as before.’</p>
<p>‘Surely thou mayest enter,’ said the young Fisherman, ‘for in
the days when with no heart thou didst go through the world thou
must have much suffered.’</p>
<p>‘Alas!’ cried his Soul, ‘I can find no place of entrance, so
compassed about with love is this heart of thine.’</p>
<p>‘Yet I would that I could help thee,’ said the young
Fisherman.</p>
<p>And as he spake there came a great cry of mourning from the sea,
even the cry that men hear when one of the Sea-folk is dead.&#160;
And the young Fisherman leapt up, and left his wattled house, and
ran down to the shore.&#160; And the black waves came hurrying to
the shore, bearing with them a burden that was whiter than
silver.&#160; White as the surf it was, and like a flower it tossed
on the waves.&#160; And the surf took it from the waves, and the
foam took it from the surf, and the shore received it, and lying at
his feet the young Fisherman saw the body of the little
Mermaid.&#160; Dead at his feet it was lying.</p>
<p>Weeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside
it, and he kissed the cold red of the mouth, and toyed with the wet
amber of the hair.&#160; He flung himself down beside it on the
sand, weeping as one trembling with joy, and in his brown arms he
held it to his breast.&#160; Cold were the lips, yet he kissed
them.&#160; Salt was the honey of the hair, yet he tasted it with a
bitter joy.&#160; He kissed the closed eyelids, and the wild spray
that lay upon their cups was less salt than his tears.</p>
<p>And to the dead thing he made confession.&#160; Into the shells
of its ears he poured the harsh wine of his tale.&#160; He put the
little hands round his neck, and with his fingers he touched the
thin reed of the throat.&#160; Bitter, bitter was his joy, and full
of strange gladness was his pain.</p>
<p>The black sea came nearer, and the white foam moaned like a
leper.&#160; With white claws of foam the sea grabbled at the
shore.&#160; From the palace of the Sea-King came the cry of
mourning again, and far out upon the sea the great Tritons blew
hoarsely upon their horns.</p>
<p>‘Flee away,’ said his Soul, ‘for ever doth the sea come nigher,
and if thou tarriest it will slay thee.&#160; Flee away, for I am
afraid, seeing that thy heart is closed against me by reason of the
greatness of thy love.&#160; Flee away to a place of safety.&#160;
Surely thou wilt not send me without a heart into another
world?’</p>
<p>But the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on
the little Mermaid and said, ‘Love is better than wisdom, and more
precious than riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of
men.&#160; The fires cannot destroy it, nor can the waters quench
it.&#160; I called on thee at dawn, and thou didst not come to my
call.&#160; The moon heard thy name, yet hadst thou no heed of
me.&#160; For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt had I
wandered away.&#160; Yet ever did thy love abide with me, and ever
was it strong, nor did aught prevail against it, though I have
looked upon evil and looked upon good.&#160; And now that thou art
dead, surely I will die with thee also.’</p>
<p>And his Soul besought him to depart, but he would not, so great
was his love.&#160; And the sea came nearer, and sought to cover
him with its waves, and when he knew that the end was at hand he
kissed with mad lips the cold lips of the Mermaid, and the heart
that was within him brake.&#160; And as through the fulness of his
love his heart did break, the Soul found an entrance and entered
in, and was one with him even as before.&#160; And the sea covered
the young Fisherman with its waves.</p>
<p>And in the morning the Priest went forth to bless the sea, for
it had been troubled.&#160; And with him went the monks and the
musicians, and the candle-bearers, and the swingers of censers, and
a great company.</p>
<p>And when the Priest reached the shore he saw the young Fisherman
lying drowned in the surf, and clasped in his arms was the body of
the little Mermaid.&#160; And he drew back frowning, and having
made the sign of the cross, he cried aloud and said, ‘I will not
bless the sea nor anything that is in it.&#160; Accursed be the
Sea-folk, and accursed be all they who traffic with them.&#160; And
as for him who for love’s sake forsook God, and so lieth here with
his leman slain by God’s judgment, take up his body and the body of
his leman, and bury them in the corner of the Field of the Fullers,
and set no mark above them, nor sign of any kind, that none may
know the place of their resting.&#160; For accursed were they in
their lives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.’</p>
<p>And the people did as he commanded them, and in the corner of
the Field of the Fullers, where no sweet herbs grew, they dug a
deep pit, and laid the dead things within it.</p>
<p>And when the third year was over, and on a day that was a holy
day, the Priest went up to the chapel, that he might show to the
people the wounds of the Lord, and speak to them about the wrath of
God.</p>
<p>And when he had robed himself with his robes, and entered in and
bowed himself before the altar, he saw that the altar was covered
with strange flowers that never had been seen before.&#160; Strange
were they to look at, and of curious beauty, and their beauty
troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils.&#160; And
he felt glad, and understood not why he was glad.</p>
<p>And after that he had opened the tabernacle, and incensed the
monstrance that was in it, and shown the fair wafer to the people,
and hid it again behind the veil of veils, he began to speak to the
people, desiring to speak to them of the wrath of God.&#160; But
the beauty of the white flowers troubled him, and their odour was
sweet in his nostrils, and there came another word into his lips,
and he spake not of the wrath of God, but of the God whose name is
Love.&#160; And why he so spake, he knew not.</p>
<p>And when he had finished his word the people wept, and the
Priest went back to the sacristy, and his eyes were full of
tears.&#160; And the deacons came in and began to unrobe him, and
took from him the alb and the girdle, the maniple and the
stole.&#160; And he stood as one in a dream.</p>
<p>And after that they had unrobed him, he looked at them and said,
‘What are the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they
come?’</p>
<p>And they answered him, ‘What flowers they are we cannot tell,
but they come from the corner of the Fullers’ Field.’&#160; And the
Priest trembled, and returned to his own house and prayed.</p>
<p>And in the morning, while it was still dawn, he went forth with
the monks and the musicians, and the candle-bearers and the
swingers of censers, and a great company, and came to the shore of
the sea, and blessed the sea, and all the wild things that are in
it.&#160; The Fauns also he blessed, and the little things that
dance in the woodland, and the bright-eyed things that peer through
the leaves.&#160; All the things in God’s world he blessed, and the
people were filled with joy and wonder.&#160; Yet never again in
the corner of the Fullers’ Field grew flowers of any kind, but the
field remained barren even as before.&#160; Nor came the Sea-folk
into the bay as they had been wont to do, for they went to another
part of the sea.</p>
