<h3 class="section_title">The Young King</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>It was the night before the day fixed for his coronation, and
the young King was sitting alone in his beautiful chamber.&#160;
His courtiers had all taken their leave of him, bowing their heads
to the ground, according to the ceremonious usage of the day, and
had retired to the Great Hall of the Palace, to receive a few last
lessons from the Professor of Etiquette; there being some of them
who had still quite natural manners, which in a courtier is, I need
hardly say, a very grave offence.</p>
<p>The lad - for he was only a lad, being but sixteen years of age
- was not sorry at their departure, and had flung himself back with
a deep sigh of relief on the soft cushions of his embroidered
couch, lying there, wild-eyed and open-mouthed, like a brown
woodland Faun, or some young animal of the forest newly snared by
the hunters.</p>
<p>And, indeed, it was the hunters who had found him, coming upon
him almost by chance as, bare-limbed and pipe in hand, he was
following the flock of the poor goatherd who had brought him up,
and whose son he had always fancied himself to be.&#160; The child
of the old King’s only daughter by a secret marriage with one much
beneath her in station - a stranger, some said, who, by the
wonderful magic of his lute-playing, had made the young Princess
love him; while others spoke of an artist from Rimini, to whom the
Princess had shown much, perhaps too much honour, and who had
suddenly disappeared from the city, leaving his work in the
Cathedral unfinished - he had been, when but a week old, stolen
away from his mother’s side, as she slept, and given into the
charge of a common peasant and his wife, who were without children
of their own, and lived in a remote part of the forest, more than a
day’s ride from the town.&#160; Grief, or the plague, as the court
physician stated, or, as some suggested, a swift Italian poison
administered in a cup of spiced wine, slew, within an hour of her
wakening, the white girl who had given him birth, and as the trusty
messenger who bare the child across his saddle-bow stooped from his
weary horse and knocked at the rude door of the goatherd’s hut, the
body of the Princess was being lowered into an open grave that had
been dug in a deserted churchyard, beyond the city gates, a grave
where it was said that another body was also lying, that of a young
man of marvellous and foreign beauty, whose hands were tied behind
him with a knotted cord, and whose breast was stabbed with many red
wounds.</p>
<p>Such, at least, was the story that men whispered to each
other.&#160; Certain it was that the old King, when on his
deathbed, whether moved by remorse for his great sin, or merely
desiring that the kingdom should not pass away from his line, had
had the lad sent for, and, in the presence of the Council, had
acknowledged him as his heir.</p>
<p>And it seems that from the very first moment of his recognition
he had shown signs of that strange passion for beauty that was
destined to have so great an influence over his life.&#160; Those
who accompanied him to the suite of rooms set apart for his
service, often spoke of the cry of pleasure that broke from his
lips when he saw the delicate raiment and rich jewels that had been
prepared for him, and of the almost fierce joy with which he flung
aside his rough leathern tunic and coarse sheepskin cloak.&#160; He
missed, indeed, at times the fine freedom of his forest life, and
was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court ceremonies that
occupied so much of each day, but the wonderful palace
-&#160;<em>Joyeuse</em>, as they called it - of which he now found
himself lord, seemed to him to be a new world fresh-fashioned for
his delight; and as soon as he could escape from the council-board
or audience-chamber, he would run down the great staircase, with
its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry, and
wander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one
who was seeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of
restoration from sickness.</p>
<p>Upon these journeys of discovery, as he would call them - and,
indeed, they were to him real voyages through a marvellous land, he
would sometimes be accompanied by the slim, fair-haired Court
pages, with their floating mantles, and gay fluttering ribands; but
more often he would be alone, feeling through a certain quick
instinct, which was almost a divination, that the secrets of art
are best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like Wisdom, loves the
lonely worshipper.</p>
<p>Many curious stories were related about him at this
period.&#160; It was said that a stout Burgo-master, who had come
to deliver a florid oratorical address on behalf of the citizens of
the town, had caught sight of him kneeling in real adoration before
a great picture that had just been brought from Venice, and that
seemed to herald the worship of some new gods.&#160; On another
occasion he had been missed for several hours, and after a
lengthened search had been discovered in a little chamber in one of
the northern turrets of the palace gazing, as one in a trance, at a
Greek gem carved with the figure of Adonis.&#160; He had been seen,
so the tale ran, pressing his warm lips to the marble brow of an
antique statue that had been discovered in the bed of the river on
the occasion of the building of the stone bridge, and was inscribed
with the name of the Bithynian slave of Hadrian.&#160; He had
passed a whole night in noting the effect of the moonlight on a
silver image of Endymion.</p>
<p>All rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination
for him, and in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many
merchants, some to traffic for amber with the rough fisher-folk of
the north seas, some to Egypt to look for that curious green
turquoise which is found only in the tombs of kings, and is said to
possess magical properties, some to Persia for silken carpets and
painted pottery, and others to India to buy gauze and stained
ivory, moonstones and bracelets of jade, sandal-wood and blue
enamel and shawls of fine wool.</p>
<p>But what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at
his coronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby-studded
crown, and the sceptre with its rows and rings of pearls.&#160;
Indeed, it was of this that he was thinking to-night, as he lay
back on his luxurious couch, watching the great pinewood log that
was burning itself out on the open hearth.&#160; The designs, which
were from the hands of the most famous artists of the time, had
been submitted to him many months before, and he had given orders
that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out,
and that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would
be worthy of their work.&#160; He saw himself in fancy standing at
the high altar of the cathedral in the fair raiment of a King, and
a smile played and lingered about his boyish lips, and lit up with
a bright lustre his dark woodland eyes.</p>
<p>After some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the
carved penthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit
room.&#160; The walls were hung with rich tapestries representing
the Triumph of Beauty.&#160; A large press, inlaid with agate and
lapis-lazuli, filled one corner, and facing the window stood a
curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and
mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets of
Venetian glass, and a cup of dark-veined onyx.&#160; Pale poppies
were broidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had
fallen from the tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted
ivory bare up the velvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich
plumes sprang, like white foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted
ceiling.&#160; A laughing Narcissus in green bronze held a polished
mirror above its head.&#160; On the table stood a flat bowl of
amethyst.</p>
<p>Outside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming
like a bubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels
pacing up and down on the misty terrace by the river.&#160; Far
away, in an orchard, a nightingale was singing.&#160; A faint
perfume of jasmine came through the open window.&#160; He brushed
his brown curls back from his forehead, and taking up a lute, let
his fingers stray across the cords.&#160; His heavy eyelids
drooped, and a strange languor came over him.&#160; Never before
had he felt so keenly, or with such exquisite joy, the magic and
the mystery of beautiful things.</p>
<p>When midnight sounded from the clock-tower he touched a bell,
and his pages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony, pouring
rose-water over his hands, and strewing flowers on his
pillow.&#160; A few moments after that they had left the room, he
fell asleep.</p>
<p>And as he slept he dreamed a dream, and this was his dream.</p>
<p>He thought that he was standing in a long, low attic, amidst the
whir and clatter of many looms.&#160; The meagre daylight peered in
through the grated windows, and showed him the gaunt figures of the
weavers bending over their cases.&#160; Pale, sickly-looking
children were crouched on the huge crossbeams.&#160; As the
shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the heavy battens,
and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall and pressed
the threads together.&#160; Their faces were pinched with famine,
and their thin hands shook and trembled.&#160; Some haggard women
were seated at a table sewing.&#160; A horrible odour filled the
place.&#160; The air was foul and heavy, and the walls dripped and
streamed with damp.</p>
<p>The young King went over to one of the weavers, and stood by him
and watched him.</p>
<p>And the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, ‘Why art thou
watching me?&#160; Art thou a spy set on us by our master?’</p>
<p>‘Who is thy master?’ asked the young King.</p>
<p>‘Our master!’ cried the weaver, bitterly.&#160; ‘He is a man
like myself.&#160; Indeed, there is but this difference between us
- that he wears fine clothes while I go in rags, and that while I
am weak from hunger he suffers not a little from overfeeding.’</p>
<p>‘The land is free,’ said the young King, ‘and thou art no man’s
slave.’</p>
<p>‘In war,’ answered the weaver, ‘the strong make slaves of the
weak, and in peace the rich make slaves of the poor.&#160; We must
work to live, and they give us such mean wages that we die.&#160;
We toil for them all day long, and they heap up gold in their
coffers, and our children fade away before their time, and the
faces of those we love become hard and evil.&#160; We tread out the
grapes, and another drinks the wine.&#160; We sow the corn, and our
own board is empty.&#160; We have chains, though no eye beholds
them; and are slaves, though men call us free.’</p>
<p>‘Is it so with all?’ he asked,</p>
<p>‘It is so with all,’ answered the weaver, ‘with the young as
well as with the old, with the women as well as with the men, with
the little children as well as with those who are stricken in
years.&#160; The merchants grind us down, and we must needs do
their bidding.&#160; The priest rides by and tells his beads, and
no man has care of us.&#160; Through our sunless lanes creeps
Poverty with her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows
close behind her.&#160; Misery wakes us in the morning, and Shame
sits with us at night.&#160; But what are these things to
thee?&#160; Thou art not one of us.&#160; Thy face is too
happy.’&#160; And he turned away scowling, and threw the shuttle
across the loom, and the young King saw that it was threaded with a
thread of gold.</p>
<p>And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver,
‘What robe is this that thou art weaving?’</p>
<p>‘It is the robe for the coronation of the young King,’ he
answered; ‘what is that to thee?’</p>
<p>And the young King gave a loud cry and woke, and lo! he was in
his own chamber, and through the window he saw the great
honey-coloured moon hanging in the dusky air.</p>
<p>And he fell asleep again and dreamed, and this was his
dream.</p>
<p>He thought that he was lying on the deck of a huge galley that
was being rowed by a hundred slaves.&#160; On a carpet by his side
the master of the galley was seated.&#160; He was black as ebony,
and his turban was of crimson silk.&#160; Great earrings of silver
dragged down the thick lobes of his ears, and in his hands he had a
pair of ivory scales.</p>
<p>The slaves were naked, but for a ragged loin-cloth, and each man
was chained to his neighbour.&#160; The hot sun beat brightly upon
them, and the negroes ran up and down the gangway and lashed them
with whips of hide.&#160; They stretched out their lean arms and
pulled the heavy oars through the water.&#160; The salt spray flew
from the blades.</p>
<p>At last they reached a little bay, and began to take
soundings.&#160; A light wind blew from the shore, and covered the
deck and the great lateen sail with a fine red dust.&#160; Three
Arabs mounted on wild asses rode out and threw spears at
them.&#160; The master of the galley took a painted bow in his hand
and shot one of them in the throat.&#160; He fell heavily into the
surf, and his companions galloped away.&#160; A woman wrapped in a
yellow veil followed slowly on a camel, looking back now and then
at the dead body.</p>
<p>As soon as they had cast anchor and hauled down the sail, the
negroes went into the hold and brought up a long rope-ladder,
heavily weighted with lead.&#160; The master of the galley threw it
over the side, making the ends fast to two iron stanchions.&#160;
Then the negroes seized the youngest of the slaves and knocked his
gyves off, and filled his nostrils and his ears with wax, and tied
a big stone round his waist.&#160; He crept wearily down the
ladder, and disappeared into the sea.&#160; A few bubbles rose
where he sank.&#160; Some of the other slaves peered curiously over
the side.&#160; At the prow of the galley sat a shark-charmer,
beating monotonously upon a drum.</p>
<p>After some time the diver rose up out of the water, and clung
panting to the ladder with a pearl in his right hand.&#160; The
negroes seized it from him, and thrust him back.&#160; The slaves
fell asleep over their oars.</p>
<p>Again and again he came up, and each time that he did so he
brought with him a beautiful pearl.&#160; The master of the galley
weighed them, and put them into a little bag of green leather.</p>
<p>The young King tried to speak, but his tongue seemed to cleave
to the roof of his mouth, and his lips refused to move.&#160; The
negroes chattered to each other, and began to quarrel over a string
of bright beads.&#160; Two cranes flew round and round the
vessel.</p>
<p>Then the diver came up for the last time, and the pearl that he
brought with him was fairer than all the pearls of Ormuz, for it
was shaped like the full moon, and whiter than the morning
star.&#160; But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon
the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils.&#160; He
quivered for a little, and then he was still.&#160; The negroes
shrugged their shoulders, and threw the body overboard.</p>
<p>And the master of the galley laughed, and, reaching out, he took
the pearl, and when he saw it he pressed it to his forehead and
bowed.&#160; ‘It shall be,’ he said, ‘for the sceptre of the young
King,’ and he made a sign to the negroes to draw up the anchor.</p>
<p>And when the young King heard this he gave a great cry, and
woke, and through the window he saw the long grey fingers of the
dawn clutching at the fading stars.</p>
<p>And he fell asleep again, and dreamed, and this was his
dream.</p>
<p>He thought that he was wandering through a dim wood, hung with
strange fruits and with beautiful poisonous flowers.&#160; The
adders hissed at him as he went by, and the bright parrots flew
screaming from branch to branch.&#160; Huge tortoises lay asleep
upon the hot mud.&#160; The trees were full of apes and
peacocks.</p>
<p>On and on he went, till he reached the outskirts of the wood,
and there he saw an immense multitude of men toiling in the bed of
a dried-up river.&#160; They swarmed up the crag like ants.&#160;
They dug deep pits in the ground and went down into them.&#160;
Some of them cleft the rocks with great axes; others grabbled in
the sand.</p>
<p>They tore up the cactus by its roots, and trampled on the
scarlet blossoms.&#160; They hurried about, calling to each other,
and no man was idle.</p>
<p>From the darkness of a cavern Death and Avarice watched them,
and Death said, ‘I am weary; give me a third of them and let me
go.’&#160; But Avarice shook her head.&#160; ‘They are my
servants,’ she answered.</p>
<p>And Death said to her, ‘What hast thou in thy hand?’</p>
<p>‘I have three grains of corn,’ she answered; ‘what is that to
thee?’</p>
<p>‘Give me one of them,’ cried Death, ‘to plant in my garden; only
one of them, and I will go away.’</p>
<p>‘I will not give thee anything,’ said Avarice, and she hid her
hand in the fold of her raiment.</p>
<p>And Death laughed, and took a cup, and dipped it into a pool of
water, and out of the cup rose Ague.&#160; She passed through the
great multitude, and a third of them lay dead.&#160; A cold mist
followed her, and the water-snakes ran by her side.</p>
<p>And when Avarice saw that a third of the multitude was dead she
beat her breast and wept.&#160; She beat her barren bosom, and
cried aloud.&#160; ‘Thou hast slain a third of my servants,’ she
cried, ‘get thee gone.&#160; There is war in the mountains of
Tartary, and the kings of each side are calling to thee.&#160; The
Afghans have slain the black ox, and are marching to battle.&#160;
They have beaten upon their shields with their spears, and have put
on their helmets of iron.&#160; What is my valley to thee, that
thou shouldst tarry in it?&#160; Get thee gone, and come here no
more.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ answered Death, ‘but till thou hast given me a grain of
corn I will not go.’</p>
<p>But Avarice shut her hand, and clenched her teeth.&#160; ‘I will
not give thee anything,’ she muttered.</p>
<p>And Death laughed, and took up a black stone, and threw it into
the forest, and out of a thicket of wild hemlock came Fever in a
robe of flame.&#160; She passed through the multitude, and touched
them, and each man that she touched died.&#160; The grass withered
beneath her feet as she walked.</p>
<p>And Avarice shuddered, and put ashes on her head.&#160; ‘Thou
art cruel,’ she cried; ‘thou art cruel.&#160; There is famine in
the walled cities of India, and the cisterns of Samarcand have run
dry.&#160; There is famine in the walled cities of Egypt, and the
locusts have come up from the desert.&#160; The Nile has not
overflowed its banks, and the priests have cursed Isis and
Osiris.&#160; Get thee gone to those who need thee, and leave me my
servants.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ answered Death, ‘but till thou hast given me a grain of
corn I will not go.’</p>
<p>‘I will not give thee anything,’ said Avarice.</p>
<p>And Death laughed again, and he whistled through his fingers,
and a woman came flying through the air.&#160; Plague was written
upon her forehead, and a crowd of lean vultures wheeled round
her.&#160; She covered the valley with her wings, and no man was
left alive.</p>
<p>And Avarice fled shrieking through the forest, and Death leaped
upon his red horse and galloped away, and his galloping was faster
than the wind.</p>
<p>And out of the slime at the bottom of the valley crept dragons
and horrible things with scales, and the jackals came trotting
along the sand, sniffing up the air with their nostrils.</p>
<p>And the young King wept, and said: ‘Who were these men, and for
what were they seeking?’</p>
<p>‘For rubies for a king’s crown,’ answered one who stood behind
him.</p>
<p>And the young King started, and, turning round, he saw a man
habited as a pilgrim and holding in his hand a mirror of
silver.</p>
<p>And he grew pale, and said: ‘For what king?’</p>
<p>And the pilgrim answered: ‘Look in this mirror, and thou shalt
see him.’</p>
<p>And he looked in the mirror, and, seeing his own face, he gave a
great cry and woke, and the bright sunlight was streaming into the
room, and from the trees of the garden and pleasaunce the birds
were singing.</p>
<p>And the Chamberlain and the high officers of State came in and
made obeisance to him, and the pages brought him the robe of
tissued gold, and set the crown and the sceptre before him.</p>
<p>And the young King looked at them, and they were
beautiful.&#160; More beautiful were they than aught that he had
ever seen.&#160; But he remembered his dreams, and he said to his
lords: ‘Take these things away, for I will not wear them.’</p>
<p>And the courtiers were amazed, and some of them laughed, for
they thought that he was jesting.</p>
<p>But he spake sternly to them again, and said: ‘Take these things
away, and hide them from me.&#160; Though it be the day of my
coronation, I will not wear them.&#160; For on the loom of Sorrow,
and by the white hands of Pain, has this my robe been woven.&#160;
There is Blood in the heart of the ruby, and Death in the heart of
the pearl.’&#160; And he told them his three dreams.</p>
<p>And when the courtiers heard them they looked at each other and
whispered, saying: ‘Surely he is mad; for what is a dream but a
dream, and a vision but a vision?&#160; They are not real things
that one should heed them.&#160; And what have we to do with the
lives of those who toil for us?&#160; Shall a man not eat bread
till he has seen the sower, nor drink wine till he has talked with
the vinedresser?’</p>
<p>And the Chamberlain spake to the young King, and said, ‘My lord,
I pray thee set aside these black thoughts of thine, and put on
this fair robe, and set this crown upon thy head.&#160; For how
shall the people know that thou art a king, if thou hast not a
king’s raiment?’</p>
<p>And the young King looked at him.&#160; ‘Is it so, indeed?’ he
questioned.&#160; ‘Will they not know me for a king if I have not a
king’s raiment?’</p>
<p>‘They will not know thee, my lord,’ cried the Chamberlain.</p>
<p>‘I had thought that there had been men who were kinglike,’ he
answered, ‘but it may be as thou sayest.&#160; And yet I will not
wear this robe, nor will I be crowned with this crown, but even as
I came to the palace so will I go forth from it.’</p>
<p>And he bade them all leave him, save one page whom he kept as
his companion, a lad a year younger than himself.&#160; Him he kept
for his service, and when he had bathed himself in clear water, he
opened a great painted chest, and from it he took the leathern
tunic and rough sheepskin cloak that he had worn when he had
watched on the hillside the shaggy goats of the goatherd.&#160;
These he put on, and in his hand he took his rude shepherd’s
staff.</p>
<p>And the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said
smiling to him, ‘My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where
is thy crown?’</p>
<p>And the young King plucked a spray of wild briar that was
climbing over the balcony, and bent it, and made a circlet of it,
and set it on his own head.</p>
<p>‘This shall he my crown,’ he answered.</p>
<p>And thus attired he passed out of his chamber into the Great
Hall, where the nobles were waiting for him.</p>
<p>And the nobles made merry, and some of them cried out to him,
‘My lord, the people wait for their king, and thou showest them a
beggar,’ and others were wroth and said, ‘He brings shame upon our
state, and is unworthy to be our master.’&#160; But he answered
them not a word, but passed on, and went down the bright porphyry
staircase, and out through the gates of bronze, and mounted upon
his horse, and rode towards the cathedral, the little page running
beside him.</p>
<p>And the people laughed and said, ‘It is the King’s fool who is
riding by,’ and they mocked him.</p>
<p>And he drew rein and said, ‘Nay, but I am the King.’&#160; And
he told them his three dreams.</p>
<p>And a man came out of the crowd and spake bitterly to him, and
said, ‘Sir, knowest thou not that out of the luxury of the rich
cometh the life of the poor?&#160; By your pomp we are nurtured,
and your vices give us bread.&#160; To toil for a hard master is
bitter, but to have no master to toil for is more bitter
still.&#160; Thinkest thou that the ravens will feed us?&#160; And
what cure hast thou for these things?&#160; Wilt thou say to the
buyer, “Thou shalt buy for so much,” and to the seller, “Thou shalt
sell at this price”?&#160; I trow not.&#160; Therefore go back to
thy Palace and put on thy purple and fine linen.&#160; What hast
thou to do with us, and what we suffer?’</p>
<p>‘Are not the rich and the poor brothers?’ asked the young
King.</p>
<p>‘Ay,’ answered the man, ‘and the name of the rich brother is
Cain.’</p>
<p>And the young King’s eyes filled with tears, and he rode on
through the murmurs of the people, and the little page grew afraid
and left him.</p>
<p>And when he reached the great portal of the cathedral, the
soldiers thrust their halberts out and said, ‘What dost thou seek
here?&#160; None enters by this door but the King.’</p>
<p>And his face flushed with anger, and he said to them, ‘I am the
King,’ and waved their halberts aside and passed in.</p>
<p>And when the old Bishop saw him coming in his goatherd’s dress,
he rose up in wonder from his throne, and went to meet him, and
said to him, ‘My son, is this a king’s apparel?&#160; And with what
crown shall I crown thee, and what sceptre shall I place in thy
hand?&#160; Surely this should be to thee a day of joy, and not a
day of abasement.’</p>
<p>‘Shall Joy wear what Grief has fashioned?’ said the young
King.&#160; And he told him his three dreams.</p>
<p>And when the Bishop had heard them he knit his brows, and said,
‘My son, I am an old man, and in the winter of my days, and I know
that many evil things are done in the wide world.&#160; The fierce
robbers come down from the mountains, and carry off the little
children, and sell them to the Moors.&#160; The lions lie in wait
for the caravans, and leap upon the camels.&#160; The wild boar
roots up the corn in the valley, and the foxes gnaw the vines upon
the hill.&#160; The pirates lay waste the sea-coast and burn the
ships of the fishermen, and take their nets from them.&#160; In the
salt-marshes live the lepers; they have houses of wattled reeds,
and none may come nigh them.&#160; The beggars wander through the
cities, and eat their food with the dogs.&#160; Canst thou make
these things not to be?&#160; Wilt thou take the leper for thy
bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board?&#160; Shall the lion do
thy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee?&#160; Is not He who made
misery wiser than thou art?&#160; Wherefore I praise thee not for
this that thou hast done, but I bid thee ride back to the Palace
and make thy face glad, and put on the raiment that beseemeth a
king, and with the crown of gold I will crown thee, and the sceptre
of pearl will I place in thy hand.&#160; And as for thy dreams,
think no more of them.&#160; The burden of this world is too great
for one man to bear, and the world’s sorrow too heavy for one heart
to suffer.’</p>
<p>‘Sayest thou that in this house?’ said the young King, and he
strode past the Bishop, and climbed up the steps of the altar, and
stood before the image of Christ.</p>
<p>He stood before the image of Christ, and on his right hand and
on his left were the marvellous vessels of gold, the chalice with
the yellow wine, and the vial with the holy oil.&#160; He knelt
before the image of Christ, and the great candles burned brightly
by the jewelled shrine, and the smoke of the incense curled in thin
blue wreaths through the dome.&#160; He bowed his head in prayer,
and the priests in their stiff copes crept away from the altar.</p>
<p>And suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in
entered the nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and
shields of polished steel.&#160; ‘Where is this dreamer of dreams?’
they cried.&#160; ‘Where is this King who is apparelled like a
beggar - this boy who brings shame upon our state?&#160; Surely we
will slay him, for he is unworthy to rule over us.’</p>
<p>And the young King bowed his head again, and prayed, and when he
had finished his prayer he rose up, and turning round he looked at
them sadly.</p>
<p>And lo! through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming
upon him, and the sun-beams wove round him a tissued robe that was
fairer than the robe that had been fashioned for his
pleasure.&#160; The dead staff blossomed, and bare lilies that were
whiter than pearls.&#160; The dry thorn blossomed, and bare roses
that were redder than rubies.&#160; Whiter than fine pearls were
the lilies, and their stems were of bright silver.&#160; Redder
than male rubies were the roses, and their leaves were of beaten
gold.</p>
<p>He stood there in the raiment of a king, and the gates of the
jewelled shrine flew open, and from the crystal of the many-rayed
monstrance shone a marvellous and mystical light.&#160; He stood
there in a king’s raiment, and the Glory of God filled the place,
and the saints in their carven niches seemed to move.&#160; In the
fair raiment of a king he stood before them, and the organ pealed
out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their trumpets, and the
singing boys sang.</p>
<p>And the people fell upon their knees in awe, and the nobles
sheathed their swords and did homage, and the Bishop’s face grew
pale, and his hands trembled.&#160; ‘A greater than I hath crowned
thee,’ he cried, and he knelt before him.</p>
<p>And the young King came down from the high altar, and passed
home through the midst of the people.&#160; But no man dared look
upon his face, for it was like the face of an angel.</p>
