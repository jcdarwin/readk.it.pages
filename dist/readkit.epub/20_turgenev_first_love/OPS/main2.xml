<p>I was in the habit of wandering about our garden every evening
on the look-out for rooks. I had long cherished a hatred for those
wary, sly, and rapacious birds. On the day of which I have been
speaking, I went as usual into the garden, and after patrolling all
the walks without success (the rooks knew me, and merely cawed
spasmodically at a distance), I chanced to go close to the low
fence which separated our domain from the narrow strip of garden
stretching beyond the lodge to the right, and belonging to it. I
was walking along, my eyes on the ground. Suddenly I heard a voice;
I looked across the fence, and was thunder-struck… . I was
confronted with a curious spectacle.</p>
<p>A few paces from me on the grass between the green raspberry
bushes stood a tall slender girl in a striped pink dress, with a
white kerchief on her head; four young men were close round her,
and she was slapping them by turns on the forehead with those small
grey flowers, the name of which I don’t know, though they are well
known to children; the flowers form little bags, and burst open
with a pop when you strike them against anything hard. The young
men presented their foreheads so eagerly, and in the gestures of
the girl (I saw her in profile), there was something so
fascinating, imperious, caressing, mocking, and charming, that I
almost cried out with admiration and delight, and would, I thought,
have given everything in the world on the spot only to have had
those exquisite fingers strike me on the forehead. My gun slipped
on to the grass, I forgot everything, I devoured with my eyes the
graceful shape and neck and lovely arms and the slightly disordered
fair hair under the white kerchief, and the half-closed clever eye,
and the eyelashes and the soft cheek beneath them… .</p>
<p>‘Young man, hey, young man,’ said a voice suddenly near me: ‘is
it quite permissible to stare so at unknown young ladies?’</p>
<p>I started, I was struck dumb… . Near me, the other side of the
fence, stood a man with close-cropped black hair, looking
ironically at me. At the same instant the girl too turned towards
me… . I caught sight of big grey eyes in a bright mobile face, and
the whole face suddenly quivered and laughed, there was a flash of
white teeth, a droll lifting of the eyebrows… . I crimsoned, picked
up my gun from the ground, and pursued by a musical but not
ill-natured laugh, fled to my own room, flung myself on the bed,
and hid my face in my hands. My heart was fairly leaping; I was
greatly ashamed and overjoyed; I felt an excitement I had never
known before.</p>
<p>After a rest, I brushed my hair, washed, and went downstairs to
tea. The image of the young girl floated before me, my heart was no
longer leaping, but was full of a sort of sweet oppression.</p>
<p>‘What’s the matter?’ my father asked me all at once: ‘have you
killed a rook?’</p>
<p>I was on the point of telling him all about it, but I checked
myself, and merely smiled to myself. As I was going to bed, I
rotated – I don’t know why – three times on one leg, pomaded my
hair, got into bed, and slept like a top all night. Before morning
I woke up for an instant, raised my head, looked round me in
ecstasy, and fell asleep again.</p>
