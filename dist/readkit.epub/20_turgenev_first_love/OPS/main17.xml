<p>The following day I only had a passing glimpse of Zinaïda: she
was driving somewhere with the old princess in a cab. But I saw
Lushin, who, however, barely vouchsafed me a greeting, and
Malevsky. The young count grinned, and began affably talking to me.
Of all those who visited at the lodge, he alone had succeeded in
forcing his way into our house, and had favourably impressed my
mother. My father did not take to him, and treated him with a
civility almost insulting.</p>
<p>‘Ah, <em>monsieur le page</em>,’ began Malevsky, ‘delighted to
meet you. What is your lovely queen doing?’</p>
<p>His fresh handsome face was so detestable to me at that moment,
and he looked at me with such contemptuous amusement that I did not
answer him at all.</p>
<p>‘Are you still angry?’ he went on. ‘You’ve no reason to be. It
wasn’t I who called you a page, you know, and pages attend queens
especially. But allow me to remark that you perform your duties
very badly.’</p>
<p>‘How so?’</p>
<p>‘Pages ought to be inseparable from their mistresses; pages
ought to know everything they do, they ought, indeed, to watch over
them,’ he added, lowering his voice, ‘day and night.’</p>
<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>
<p>‘What do I mean? I express myself pretty clearly, I fancy. Day
and night. By day it’s not so much matter; it’s light, and people
are about in the daytime; but by night, then look out for
misfortune. I advise you not to sleep at nights and to watch, watch
with all your energies. You remember, in the garden, by night, at
the fountain, that’s where there’s need to look out. You will thank
me.’</p>
<p>Malevsky laughed and turned his back on me. He, most likely,
attached no great importance to what he had said to me, he had a
reputation for mystifying, and was noted for his power of taking
people in at masquerades, which was greatly augmented by the almost
unconscious falsity in which his whole nature was steeped… . He
only wanted to tease me; but every word he uttered was a poison
that ran through my veins. The blood rushed to my head. ‘Ah! so
that’s it!’ I said to myself; ‘good! So there was reason for me to
feel drawn into the garden! That shan’t be so!’ I cried aloud, and
struck myself on the chest with my fist, though precisely what
should not be so I could not have said. ‘Whether Malevsky himself
goes into the garden,’ I thought (he was bragging, perhaps; he has
insolence enough for that), ‘or some one else (the fence of our
garden was very low, and there was no difficulty in getting over
it), anyway, if any one falls into my hands, it will be the worse
for him! I don’t advise any one to meet me! I will prove to all the
world and to her, the traitress (I actually used the word
‘traitress’) that I can be revenged!’</p>
<p>I returned to my own room, took out of the writing-table an
English knife I had recently bought, felt its sharp edge, and
knitting my brows with an air of cold and concentrated
determination, thrust it into my pocket, as though doing such deeds
was nothing out of the way for me, and not the first time. My heart
heaved angrily, and felt heavy as a stone. All day long I kept a
scowling brow and lips tightly compressed, and was continually
walking up and down, clutching, with my hand in my pocket, the
knife, which was warm from my grasp, while I prepared myself
beforehand for something terrible. These new unknown sensations so
occupied and even delighted me, that I hardly thought of Zinaïda
herself. I was continually haunted by Aleko, the young gipsy –
‘Where art thou going, young handsome man? Lie there,’ and then,
‘thou art all besprent with blood… . Oh, what hast thou done?…
Naught!’ With what a cruel smile I repeated that ‘Naught!’ My
father was not at home; but my mother, who had for some time past
been in an almost continual state of dumb exasperation, noticed my
gloomy and heroic aspect, and said to me at supper, ‘Why are you
sulking like a mouse in a meal-tub?’ I merely smiled
condescendingly in reply, and thought, ‘If only they knew!’ It
struck eleven; I went to my room, but did not undress; I waited for
midnight; at last it struck. ‘The time has come!’ I muttered
between my teeth; and buttoning myself up to the throat, and even
pulling my sleeves up, I went into the garden.</p>
<p>I had already fixed on the spot from which to keep watch. At the
end of the garden, at the point where the fence, separating our
domain from the Zasyekins’, joined the common wall, grew a
pine-tree, standing alone. Standing under its low thick branches, I
could see well, as far as the darkness of the night permitted, what
took place around. Close by, ran a winding path which had always
seemed mysterious to me; it coiled like a snake under the fence,
which at that point bore traces of having been climbed over, and
led to a round arbour formed of thick acacias. I made my way to the
pine-tree, leaned my back against its trunk, and began my
watch.</p>
<p>The night was as still as the night before, but there were fewer
clouds in the sky, and the outlines of bushes, even of tall
flowers, could be more distinctly seen. The first moments of
expectation were oppressive, almost terrible. I had made up my mind
to everything. I only debated how to act; whether to thunder,
‘Where goest thou? Stand! show thyself – or death!’ or simply to
strike… . Every sound, every whisper and rustle, seemed to me
portentous and extraordinary… . I prepared myself… . I bent
forward… . But half-an-hour passed, an hour passed; my blood had
grown quieter, colder; the consciousness that I was doing all this
for nothing, that I was even a little absurd, that Malevsky had
been making fun of me, began to steal over me. I left my ambush,
and walked all about the garden. As if to taunt me, there was not
the smallest sound to be heard anywhere; everything was at rest.
Even our dog was asleep, curled up into a ball at the gate. I
climbed up into the ruins of the greenhouse, saw the open country
far away before me, recalled my meeting with Zinaïda, and fell to
dreaming… .</p>
<p>I started… . I fancied I heard the creak of a door opening, then
the faint crack of a broken twig. In two bounds I got down from the
ruin, and stood still, all aghast. Rapid, light, but cautious
footsteps sounded distinctly in the garden. They were approaching
me. ‘Here he is&#160;… here he is, at last!’ flashed through my
heart. With spasmodic haste, I pulled the knife out of my pocket;
with spasmodic haste, I opened it. Flashes of red were whirling
before my eyes; my hair stood up on my head in my fear and fury… .
The steps were coming straight towards me; I bent – I craned
forward to meet him… . A man came into view… . My God! it was my
father! I recognised him at once, though he was all muffled up in a
dark cloak, and his hat was pulled down over his face. On tip-toe
he walked by. He did not notice me, though nothing concealed me;
but I was so huddled up and shrunk together that I fancy I was
almost on the level of the ground. The jealous Othello, ready for
murder, was suddenly transformed into a school-boy… . I was so
taken aback by my father’s unexpected appearance that for the first
moment I did not notice where he had come from or in what direction
he disappeared. I only drew myself up, and thought, ‘Why is it my
father is walking about in the garden at night?’ when everything
was still again. In my horror I had dropped my knife in the grass,
but I did not even attempt to look for it; I was very much ashamed
of myself. I was completely sobered at once. On my way to the
house, however, I went up to my seat under the elder-tree, and
looked up at Zinaïda’s window. The small slightly-convex panes of
the window shone dimly blue in the faint light thrown on them by
the night sky. All at once – their colour began to change… . Behind
them – I saw this, saw it distinctly – softly and cautiously a
white blind was let down, let down right to the window-frame, and
so stayed.</p>
<p>‘What is that for?’ I said aloud almost involuntarily when I
found myself once more in my room. ‘A dream, a chance, or&#160;… ’
The suppositions which suddenly rushed into my head were so new and
strange that I did not dare to entertain them.</p>
