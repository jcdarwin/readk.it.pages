<p>Four years passed. I had just left the university, and did not
know exactly what to do with myself, at what door to knock; I was
hanging about for a time with nothing to do. One fine evening I met
Meidanov at the theatre. He had got married, and had entered the
civil service; but I found no change in him. He fell into ecstasies
in just the same superfluous way, and just as suddenly grew
depressed again.</p>
<p>‘You know,’ he told me among other things, ‘Madame Dolsky’s
here.’</p>
<p>‘What Madame Dolsky?’</p>
<p>‘Can you have forgotten her? – the young Princess Zasyekin whom
we were all in love with, and you too. Do you remember at the
country-house near Neskutchny gardens?’</p>
<p>‘She married a Dolsky?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘And is she here, in the theatre?’</p>
<p>‘No: but she’s in Petersburg. She came here a few days ago.
She’s going abroad.’</p>
<p>‘What sort of fellow is her husband?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘A splendid fellow, with property. He’s a colleague of mine in
Moscow. You can well understand – after the scandal&#160;… you must
know all about it&#160;… ’ (Meidanov smiled significantly) ‘it was
no easy task for her to make a good marriage; there were
consequences&#160;… but with her cleverness, everything is
possible. Go and see her; she’ll be delighted to see you. She’s
prettier than ever.’</p>
<p>Meidanov gave me Zinaïda’s address. She was staying at the Hotel
Demut. Old memories were astir within me… . I determined next day
to go to see my former ‘flame.’ But some business happened to turn
up; a week passed, and then another, and when at last I went to the
Hotel Demut and asked for Madame Dolsky, I learnt that four days
before, she had died, almost suddenly, in childbirth.</p>
<p>I felt a sort of stab at my heart. The thought that I might have
seen her, and had not seen her, and should never see her – that
bitter thought stung me with all the force of overwhelming
reproach. ‘She is dead!’ I repeated, staring stupidly at the
hall-porter. I slowly made my way back to the street, and walked on
without knowing myself where I was going. All the past swam up and
rose at once before me. So this was the solution, this was the goal
to which that young, ardent, brilliant life had striven, all haste
and agitation! I mused on this; I fancied those dear features,
those eyes, those curls – in the narrow box, in the damp
underground darkness – lying here, not far from me – while I was
still alive, and, maybe, a few paces from my father… . I thought
all this; I strained my imagination, and yet all the while the
lines:</p>
<p>‘From lips indifferent of her death I heard, Indifferently I
listened to it, too,’</p>
<p>were echoing in my heart. O youth, youth! little dost thou care
for anything; thou art master, as it were, of all the treasures of
the universe – even sorrow gives thee pleasure, even grief thou
canst turn to thy profit; thou art self-confident and insolent;
thou sayest, ‘I alone am living – look you!’ – but thy days fly by
all the while, and vanish without trace or reckoning; and
everything in thee vanishes, like wax in the sun, like snow… . And,
perhaps, the whole secret of thy charm lies, not in being able to
do anything, but in being able to think thou wilt do anything; lies
just in thy throwing to the winds, forces which thou couldst not
make other use of; in each of us gravely regarding himself as a
prodigal, gravely supposing that he is justified in saying, ‘Oh,
what might I not have done if I had not wasted my time!’</p>
<p>I, now&#160;… what did I hope for, what did I expect, what rich
future did I foresee, when the phantom of my first love, rising up
for an instant, barely called forth one sigh, one mournful
sentiment?</p>
<p>And what has come to pass of all I hoped for? And now, when the
shades of evening begin to steal over my life, what have I left
fresher, more precious, than the memories of the storm – so soon
over – of early morning, of spring?</p>
<p>But I do myself injustice. Even then, in those light-hearted
young days, I was not deaf to the voice of sorrow, when it called
upon me, to the solemn strains floating to me from beyond the tomb.
I remember, a few days after I heard of Zinaïda’s death, I was
present, through a peculiar, irresistible impulse, at the death of
a poor old woman who lived in the same house as we. Covered with
rags, lying on hard boards, with a sack under her head, she died
hardly and painfully. Her whole life had been passed in the bitter
struggle with daily want; she had known no joy, had not tasted the
honey of happiness. One would have thought, surely she would
rejoice at death, at her deliverance, her rest. But yet, as long as
her decrepit body held out, as long as her breast still heaved in
agony under the icy hand weighing upon it, until her last forces
left her, the old woman crossed herself, and kept whispering,
‘Lord, forgive my sins’; and only with the last spark of
consciousness, vanished from her eyes the look of fear, of horror
of the end. And I remember that then, by the death-bed of that poor
old woman, I felt aghast for Zinaïda, and longed to pray for her,
for my father – and for myself.</p>
