<p>The days passed by. Zinaïda became stranger and stranger, and
more and more incomprehensible. One day I went over to her, and saw
her sitting in a basket-chair, her head pressed to the sharp edge
of the table. She drew herself up&#160;… her whole face was wet
with tears.</p>
<p>‘Ah, you!’ she said with a cruel smile. ‘Come here.’</p>
<p>I went up to her. She put her hand on my head, and suddenly
catching hold of my hair, began pulling it.</p>
<p>‘It hurts me,’ I said at last.</p>
<p>‘Ah! does it? And do you suppose nothing hurts me?’ she
replied.</p>
<p>‘Ai!’ she cried suddenly, seeing she had pulled a little tuft of
hair out. ‘What have I done? Poor M’sieu Voldemar!’</p>
<p>She carefully smoothed the hair she had torn out, stroked it
round her finger, and twisted it into a ring.</p>
<p>‘I shall put your hair in a locket and wear it round my neck,’
she said, while the tears still glittered in her eyes. ‘That will
be some small consolation to you, perhaps&#160;… and now
good-bye.’</p>
<p>I went home, and found an unpleasant state of things there. My
mother was having a scene with my father; she was reproaching him
with something, while he, as his habit was, maintained a polite and
chilly silence, and soon left her. I could not hear what my mother
was talking of, and indeed I had no thought to spare for the
subject; I only remember that when the interview was over, she sent
for me to her room, and referred with great displeasure to the
frequent visits I paid the princess, who was, in her words, <em>une
femme capable de tout</em>. I kissed her hand (this was what I
always did when I wanted to cut short a conversation) and went off
to my room. Zinaïda’s tears had completely overwhelmed me; I
positively did not know what to think, and was ready to cry myself;
I was a child after all, in spite of my sixteen years. I had now
given up thinking about Malevsky, though Byelovzorov looked more
and more threatening every day, and glared at the wily count like a
wolf at a sheep; but I thought of nothing and of no one. I was lost
in imaginings, and was always seeking seclusion and solitude. I was
particularly fond of the ruined greenhouse. I would climb up on the
high wall, and perch myself, and sit there, such an unhappy,
lonely, and melancholy youth, that I felt sorry for myself – and
how consolatory where those mournful sensations, how I revelled in
them!…</p>
<p>One day I was sitting on the wall looking into the distance and
listening to the ringing of the bells… . Suddenly something floated
up to me – not a breath of wind and not a shiver, but as it were a
whiff of fragrance – as it were, a sense of some one’s being near…
. I looked down. Below, on the path, in a light greyish gown, with
a pink parasol on her shoulder, was Zinaïda, hurrying along. She
caught sight of me, stopped, and pushing back the brim of her straw
hat, she raised her velvety eyes to me.</p>
<p>‘What are you doing up there at such a height?’ she asked me
with a rather queer smile. ‘Come,’ she went on, ‘you always declare
you love me; jump down into the road to me if you really do love
me.’</p>
<p>Zinaïda had hardly uttered those words when I flew down, just as
though some one had given me a violent push from behind. The wall
was about fourteen feet high. I reached the ground on my feet, but
the shock was so great that I could not keep my footing; I fell
down, and for an instant fainted away. When I came to myself again,
without opening my eyes, I felt Zinaïda beside me. ‘My dear boy,’
she was saying, bending over me, and there was a note of alarmed
tenderness in her voice, ‘how could you do it, dear; how could you
obey?… You know I love you… . Get up.’</p>
<p>Her bosom was heaving close to me, her hands were caressing my
head, and suddenly – what were my emotions at that moment – her
soft, fresh lips began covering my face with kisses&#160;… they
touched my lips… . But then Zinaïda probably guessed by the
expression of my face that I had regained consciousness, though I
still kept my eyes closed, and rising rapidly to her feet, she
said: ‘Come, get up, naughty boy, silly, why are you lying in the
dust?’ I got up. ‘Give me my parasol,’ said Zinaïda, ‘I threw it
down somewhere, and don’t stare at me like that&#160;… what
ridiculous nonsense! you’re not hurt, are you? stung by the
nettles, I daresay? Don’t stare at me, I tell you… . But he doesn’t
understand, he doesn’t answer,’ she added, as though to herself… .
‘Go home, M’sieu’ Voldemar, brush yourself, and don’t dare to
follow me, or I shall be angry, and never again&#160;… ’</p>
<p>She did not finish her sentence, but walked rapidly away, while
I sat down by the side of the road&#160;… my legs would not support
me. The nettles had stung my hands, my back ached, and my head was
giddy; but the feeling of rapture I experienced then has never come
a second time in my life. It turned to a sweet ache in all my limbs
and found expression at last in joyful hops and skips and shouts.
Yes, I was still a child.</p>
