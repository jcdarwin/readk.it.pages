<p>After dinner the usual party assembled again at the lodge, and
the young princess came out to them. All were there in full force,
just as on that first evening which I never forgot; even Nirmatsky
had limped to see her; Meidanov came this time earliest of all, he
brought some new verses. The games of forfeits began again, but
without the strange pranks, the practical jokes and noise – the
gipsy element had vanished. Zinaïda gave a different tone to the
proceedings. I sat beside her by virtue of my office as page. Among
other things, she proposed that any one who had to pay a forfeit
should tell his dream; but this was not successful. The dreams were
either uninteresting (Byelovzorov had dreamed that he fed his mare
on carp, and that she had a wooden head), or unnatural and
invented. Meidanov regaled us with a regular romance; there were
sepulchres in it, and angels with lyres, and talking flowers and
music wafted from afar. Zinaïda did not let him finish. ‘If we are
to have compositions,’ she said, ‘let every one tell something made
up, and no pretence about it.’ The first who had to speak was again
Byelovzorov.</p>
<p>The young hussar was confused. ‘I can’t make up anything!’ he
cried.</p>
<p>‘What nonsense!’ said Zinaïda. ‘Well, imagine, for instance, you
are married, and tell us how you would treat your wife. Would you
lock her up?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I should lock her up.’</p>
<p>‘And would you stay with her yourself?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I should certainly stay with her myself.’</p>
<p>‘Very good. Well, but if she got sick of that, and she deceived
you?’</p>
<p>‘I should kill her.’</p>
<p>‘And if she ran away?’</p>
<p>‘I should catch her up and kill her all the same.’</p>
<p>‘Oh. And suppose now I were your wife, what would you do
then?’</p>
<p>Byelovzorov was silent a minute. ‘I should kill myself… .’</p>
<p>Zinaïda laughed. ‘I see yours is not a long story.’</p>
<p>The next forfeit was Zinaïda’s. She looked at the ceiling and
considered. ‘Well, listen, she began at last, ‘what I have thought
of… . Picture to yourselves a magnificent palace, a summer night,
and a marvellous ball. This ball is given by a young queen.
Everywhere gold and marble, crystal, silk, lights, diamonds,
flowers, fragrant scents, every caprice of luxury.’</p>
<p>‘You love luxury?’ Lushin interposed. ‘Luxury is beautiful,’ she
retorted; ‘I love everything beautiful.’</p>
<p>‘More than what is noble?’ he asked.</p>
<p>‘That’s something clever, I don’t understand it. Don’t interrupt
me. So the ball is magnificent. There are crowds of guests, all of
them are young, handsome, and brave, all are frantically in love
with the queen.’</p>
<p>‘Are there no women among the guests?’ queried Malevsky.</p>
<p>‘No – or wait a minute – yes, there are some.’</p>
<p>‘Are they all ugly?’</p>
<p>‘No, charming. But the men are all in love with the queen. She
is tall and graceful; she has a little gold diadem on her black
hair.’</p>
<p>I looked at Zinaïda, and at that instant she seemed to me so
much above all of us, there was such bright intelligence, and such
power about her unruffled brows, that I thought: ‘You are that
queen!’</p>
<p>‘They all throng about her,’ Zinaïda went on, ‘and all lavish
the most flattering speeches upon her.’</p>
<p>‘And she likes flattery?’ Lushin queried.</p>
<p>‘What an intolerable person! he keeps interrupting&#160;… who
doesn’t like flattery?’</p>
<p>‘One more last question,’ observed Malevsky, ‘has the queen a
husband?’</p>
<p>‘I hadn’t thought about that. No, why should she have a
husband?’</p>
<p>‘To be sure,’ assented Malevsky, ‘why should she have a
husband?’</p>
<p>‘<em>Silence!</em>’ cried Meidanov in French, which he spoke
very badly.</p>
<p>‘<em>Merci!</em>’ Zinaïda said to him. ‘And so the queen hears
their speeches, and hears the music, but does not look at one of
the guests. Six windows are open from top to bottom, from floor to
ceiling, and beyond them is a dark sky with big stars, a dark
garden with big trees. The queen gazes out into the garden. Out
there among the trees is a fountain; it is white in the darkness,
and rises up tall, tall as an apparition. The queen hears, through
the talk and the music, the soft splash of its waters. She gazes
and thinks: you are all, gentlemen, noble, clever, and rich, you
crowd round me, you treasure every word I utter, you are all ready
to die at my feet, I hold you in my power&#160;… but out there, by
the fountain, by that splashing water, stands and waits he whom I
love, who holds me in his power. He has neither rich raiment nor
precious stones, no one knows him, but he awaits me, and is certain
I shall come – and I shall come – and there is no power that could
stop me when I want to go out to him, and to stay with him, and be
lost with him out there in the darkness of the garden, under the
whispering of the trees, and the splash of the fountain&#160;… ’
Zinaïda ceased.</p>
<p>‘Is that a made-up story?’ Malevsky inquired slyly. Zinaïda did
not even look at him.</p>
<p>‘And what should we have done, gentlemen?’ Lushin began
suddenly, ‘if we had been among the guests, and had known of the
lucky fellow at the fountain?’</p>
<p>‘Stop a minute, stop a minute,’ interposed Zinaïda, ‘I will tell
you myself what each of you would have done. You, Byelovzorov,
would have challenged him to a duel; you, Meidanov, would have
written an epigram on him&#160;… No, though, you can’t write
epigrams, you would have made up a long poem on him in the style of
Barbier, and would have inserted your production in the
<em>Telegraph</em>. You, Nirmatsky, would have borrowed&#160;… no,
you would have lent him money at high interest; you, doctor,… ’ she
stopped. ‘There, I really don’t know what you would have done…
.’</p>
<p>‘In the capacity of court physician,’ answered Lushin, ‘I would
have advised the queen not to give balls when she was not in the
humour for entertaining her guests… .’</p>
<p>‘Perhaps you would have been right. And you, Count?… ’</p>
<p>‘And I?’ repeated Malevsky with his evil smile… .</p>
<p>‘You would offer him a poisoned sweetmeat.’ Malevsky’s face
changed slightly, and assumed for an instant a Jewish expression,
but he laughed directly.</p>
<p>‘And as for you, Voldemar,… ’ Zinaïda went on, ‘but that’s
enough, though; let us play another game.’</p>
<p>‘M’sieu Voldemar, as the queen’s page, would have held up her
train when she ran into the garden,’ Malevsky remarked
malignantly.</p>
<p>I was crimson with anger, but Zinaïda hurriedly laid a hand on
my shoulder, and getting up, said in a rather shaky voice: ‘I have
never given your excellency the right to be rude, and therefore I
will ask you to leave us.’ She pointed to the door.</p>
<p>‘Upon my word, princess,’ muttered Malevsky, and he turned quite
pale.</p>
<p>‘The princess is right,’ cried Byelovzorov, and he too rose.</p>
<p>‘Good God, I’d not the least idea,’ Malevsky went on, ‘in my
words there was nothing, I think, that could&#160;… I had no notion
of offending you… . Forgive me.’</p>
<p>Zinaïda looked him up and down coldly, and coldly smiled. ‘Stay,
then, certainly,’ she pronounced with a careless gesture of her
arm.</p>
<p>‘M’sieu Voldemar and I were needlessly incensed. It is your
pleasure to sting&#160;… may it do you good.’</p>
<p>‘Forgive me,’ Malevsky repeated once more; while I, my thoughts
dwelling on Zinaïda’s gesture, said to myself again that no real
queen could with greater dignity have shown a presumptuous subject
to the door.</p>
<p>The game of forfeits went on for a short time after this little
scene; every one felt rather ill at ease, not so much on account of
this scene, as from another, not quite definite, but oppressive
feeling. No one spoke of it, but every one was conscious of it in
himself and in his neighbour. Meidanov read us his verses; and
Malevsky praised them with exaggerated warmth. ‘He wants to show
how good he is now,’ Lushin whispered to me. We soon broke up. A
mood of reverie seemed to have come upon Zinaïda; the old princess
sent word that she had a headache; Nirmatsky began to complain of
his rheumatism… .</p>
<p>I could not for a long while get to sleep. I had been impressed
by Zinaïda’s story. ‘Can there have been a hint in it?’ I asked
myself: ‘and at whom and at what was she hinting? And if there
really is anything to hint at&#160;… how is one to make up one’s
mind? No, no, it can’t be,’ I whispered, turning over from one hot
cheek on to the other… . But I remembered the expression of
Zinaïda’s face during her story… . I remembered the exclamation
that had broken from Lushin in the Neskutchny gardens, the sudden
change in her behaviour to me, and I was lost in conjectures. ‘Who
is he?’ These three words seemed to stand before my eyes traced
upon the darkness; a lowering malignant cloud seemed hanging over
me, and I felt its oppressiveness, and waited for it to break. I
had grown used to many things of late; I had learned much from what
I had seen at the Zasyekins; their disorderly ways, tallow
candle-ends, broken knives and forks, grumpy Vonifaty, and shabby
maid-servants, the manners of the old princess – all their strange
mode of life no longer struck me… . But what I was dimly discerning
now in Zinaïda, I could never get used to… . ‘An adventuress!’ my
mother had said of her one day. An adventuress – she, my idol, my
divinity? This word stabbed me, I tried to get away from it into my
pillow, I was indignant – and at the same time what would I not
have agreed to, what would I not have given only to be that lucky
fellow at the fountain!… My blood was on fire and boiling within
me. ‘The garden&#160;… the fountain,’ I mused… . ‘I will go into
the garden.’ I dressed quickly and slipped out of the house. The
night was dark, the trees scarcely whispered, a soft chill air
breathed down from the sky, a smell of fennel trailed across from
the kitchen garden. I went through all the walks; the light sound
of my own footsteps at once confused and emboldened me; I stood
still, waited and heard my heart beating fast and loudly. At last I
went up to the fence and leaned against the thin bar. Suddenly, or
was it my fancy, a woman’s figure flashed by, a few paces from
me&#160;… I strained my eyes eagerly into the darkness, I held my
breath. What was that? Did I hear steps, or was it my heart beating
again? ‘Who is here?’ I faltered, hardly audibly. What was that
again, a smothered laugh&#160;… or a rustling in the leaves&#160;…
or a sigh just at my ear? I felt afraid&#160;… ‘Who is here?’ I
repeated still more softly.</p>
<p>The air blew in a gust for an instant; a streak of fire flashed
across the sky; it was a star falling. ‘Zinaïda?’ I wanted to call,
but the word died away on my lips. And all at once everything
became profoundly still around, as is often the case in the middle
of the night… . Even the grasshoppers ceased their churr in the
trees – only a window rattled somewhere. I stood and stood, and
then went back to my room, to my chilled bed. I felt a strange
sensation; as though I had gone to a tryst, and had been left
lonely, and had passed close by another’s happiness.</p>
