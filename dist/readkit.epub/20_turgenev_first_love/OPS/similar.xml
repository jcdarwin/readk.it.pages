Sons</em></a>
<p>When a young graduate returns home he is accompanied, much to
his father and uncle's discomfort, by a strange friend "who doesn't
acknowledge any authorities, who doesn't accept a single principle
on faith." Turgenev's masterpiece of generational conflict shocked
Russian society when it was published in 1862 and continues today
to seem as fresh and outspoken as it did to those who first
encountered its nihilistic hero.</p>

Soil</em></a>
<p>VIRGIN SOIL by Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev (1818-1883) is his last
and longest novel. In it he finally says everything yet unsaid on
the subject of social change, idealism and yet futility of
revolutions, serfs and peasants, and the upper classes. The hero,
Nezhdanov -- the disillusioned young son of a nobleman -- and the
Populist movement are young idealists working to bridge the gap
between the common people and the nobility, and through them
Turgenev works out his own troubled thoughts about social reform
and tradition, vitality and stagnation. The ideas of gradual reform
shown here are eventually to be supplanted by the extremism of the
Russian Revolution -- but that is yet to come.</p>

Karenina</em></a>
<p>Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair between the
sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count
Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage
and must endure the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and
richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's
seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the
contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love
and family happiness.</p>

and Juliet</em></a>
<p>Romeo and Juliet is a tragic play written early in the career of
William Shakespeare about two teenage "star-cross'd lovers" whose
untimely deaths ultimately unite their feuding households. It was
among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and,
along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays.
Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal "young
lovers". (From Wikipedia)</p>

and Prejudice</em></a>
<p>Pride And Prejudice, the story of Mrs. Bennet's attempts to
marry off her five daughters is one of the best-loved and most
enduring classics in English literature. Excitement fizzes through
the Bennet household at Longbourn in Hertfordshire when young,
eligible Mr. Charles Bingley rents the fine house nearby. He may
have sisters, but he also has male friends, and one of these—the
haughty, and even wealthier, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy—irks the
vivacious Elizabeth Bennet, the second of the Bennet girls. She
annoys him. Which is how we know they must one day marry. The
romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and Darcy is a
splendid rendition of civilized sparring. As the characters dance a
delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, Jane Austen's
radiantly caustic wit and keen observation sparkle.</p>

Portrait of a Lady</em></a>
<p>One of the great heroines of American literature, Isabel Archer,
journeys to Europe in order to, as Henry James writes in his 1908
Preface, “affront her destiny.” James began The Portrait of a Lady
without a plot or subject, only the slim but provocative notion of
a young woman taking control of her fate. The result is a richly
imagined study of an American heiress who turns away her suitors in
an effort to first establish—and then protect—her independence. But
Isabel’s pursuit of spiritual freedom collapses when she meets the
captivating Gilbert Osmond. “James’s formidable powers of
observation, his stance as a kind of bachelor recorder of human
doings in which he is not involved,” writes Hortense Calisher,
“make him a first-class documentarian, joining him to that great
body of storytellers who amass what formal history cannot.”</p>

Scarlet Letter</em></a>
<p>The Scarlet Letter, published in 1850, is an American novel
written by Nathaniel Hawthorne and is generally considered to be
his magnum opus. Set in 17th-century Puritan Boston, it tells the
story of Hester Prynne, who gives birth after committing adultery,
refuses to name the father, and struggles to create a new life of
repentance and dignity.<br />
Throughout the novel, Hawthorne explores questions of grace,
legalism, sin and guilt.</p>

with a View</em></a>
<p>This Edwardian social comedy explores love and prim propriety
among an eccentric cast of characters assembled in an Italian
pensione and in a corner of Surrey, England.</p>
<p>A charming young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch, faints into the
arms of a fellow Britisher when she witnesses a murder in a
Florentine piazza. Attracted to this man, George Emerson—who is
entirely unsuitable and whose father just may be a Socialist—Lucy
is soon at war with the snobbery of her class and her own
conflicting desires. Back in England, she is courted by a more
acceptable, if stifling, suitor and soon realizes she must make a
startling decision that will decide the course of her future: she
is forced to choose between convention and passion.</p>
