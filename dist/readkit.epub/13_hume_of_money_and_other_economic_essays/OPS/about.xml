<p>David Hume (1711–1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian,
economist, and essayist, known especially for his philosophical
empiricism and scepticism. He was one of the most important figures
in the history of Western philosophy and the Scottish
Enlightenment. Hume is often grouped with John Locke, George
Berkeley, and a handful of others as a British Empiricist. He
changed the spelling of his name from the Scottish "Home" in 1734,
because "Home" was pronounced as the English pronounced "Hume",
which was not known in England. Hume attended the University of
Edinburgh at the unusually early age of twelve (possibly as young
as ten) at a time when fourteen was normal. At first he considered
a career in law, but came to have, in his words, "an insurmountable
aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general
Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over Voet and
Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the Authors which I was secretly
devouring." He had little respect for the professors of his time,
telling a friend in 1735, "there is nothing to be learnt from a
Professor, which is not to be met with in Books." He found
employment at various times as a merchant's clerk and as a tutor,
while continuing to study philosophy and write his works, the first
of which, <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em>, he completed at age
26. It was not well received by critics in Great Britain. In 1744
Hume applied for the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at
the University of Edinburgh. However, the position was given to
someone else after Edinburgh ministers petitioned the town council
not to appoint Hume because he was seen as an atheist. Later, Hume
was charged with heresy, but he was defended by his young clerical
friends, who argued that — as an atheist — he was outside the
Church's jurisdiction. Despite his acquittal, Hume failed to gain
the chair of philosophy at the University of Glasgow. Hume wrote on
the subjects of philosophy (especially on epistemology — how one
knows something to be true), religion, history, and politics.
Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that
are prevalent in the field of economics today. This includes ideas
on private property, inflation, and foreign trade. Referring to
Hume's essay "Of the Balance of Trade," Paul Krugman (a
Nobel-prize-winning economist) has remarked "… David Hume created
what I consider the first true economic model." (Reference:
