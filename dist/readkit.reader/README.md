The Readk.it Reader is a single html file which allows you to read EPUB content in one of two ways:

1. Double-click the readkit.reader.html file to open it in a browser (i.e. using a file URL)
2. Web-serve the readkit.reader.html file

Either using a file URL or web-served, drag and drop another EPUB file onto the browser window to start reading.
