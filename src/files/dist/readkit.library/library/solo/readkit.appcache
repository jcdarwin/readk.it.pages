CACHE MANIFEST

# v1.0 Fri Oct 18 2013 10:28:31 GMT+1300 (NZDT)

# For application-cache gotchas, refer:
# http://www.alistapart.com/articles/application-cache-is-a-douchebag/

# This application cache is for use with production solo readk.it.
# As solo readk.it is a single file containing all resources 
# (i.e. there are no external resources) and as an html file which 
# references the application cache manifest is automatically cached
# without needing to be included in the application cache, we therefore
# don't need to list any files here.
