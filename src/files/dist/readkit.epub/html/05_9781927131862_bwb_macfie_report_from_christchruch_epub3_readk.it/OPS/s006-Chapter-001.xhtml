         </div>

         <h5 id="h51">12 March 2011</h5>

         <p id="p19">The grief sits like hot magma, held down by a crust of action. There has been so much to do, at our house and in our street. We have boarded up the big front windows that were shunted out and smashed to the ground. We have shovelled up the sticky, smelly, shattered mess of our kitchen and dumped it in the wheelie bin, rescued books from under the rubble of bricks, retrieved documents and photos, and gathered up enough clothes and other bits and pieces to allow us to function comfortably in the meantime at my sister&#8217;s house.</p>

         <p id="p20">Often unexpectedly, the magma forces its way through, as when two of the carpenters from the construction company my husband works for came to help us on the first Friday. They had been working in the red-brick Poplar Lane in the CBD when they heard a bang and knew immediately to run for their lives out to Lichfield St, where they saw buildings crash down and a great cloud of dust go up.</p>

         <p id="p21">As he boarded up my downstairs office window, one told me of a man and woman who had been forced through the plate-glass frontage of a hair salon and were pinned by the legs and feet under a fallen verandah. The men had used their equipment to free the couple, enabling them to be taken away for treatment; they wondered if the man&#8217;s lower legs would have survived. Among it all they looked up and saw the Hotel Grand Chancellor, a block away, sway five to 10 metres from side to side. The next day they were at work, and now here they were at our house, helping us cut a path through our chaos.</p>

         <p id="p22">Feelings burst through when anxiety for my neighbourhood shifts from a background ache to a sharp fear. For 17-and-a-half years our street, snuggled into the lower slopes of the Port Hills, has been my safe haven. We moved to our boxy brick house, with its terrible access and 1950s foibles, when our son was nearly two and I was 41 weeks pregnant with our daughter. We carted all our stuff up the zigzag path on the same day that New Zealand voted for MMP.</p>

         <p id="p23">Our kids would wander off to school in the valley along with most of the other kids in the street. We visit neighbours through gaps in hedges and over fences. It is my village. Now it is mostly deserted. Some houses lie in ruins, their owners lucky to be alive. Many other houses, although still standing, are severely damaged.</p>

         <p id="p24">One morning at 4.30 when I couldn&#8217;t sleep, I started the first of a new thread on the neighbourhood online group that a few of us got going last year. I shared our news and that of any others I knew about, and pleaded with everyone to keep the links alive while so many of us are displaced. Soon more than a dozen households had joined the conversation, exchanging their stories and sadness, spreading useful information about power and water, and other news of relevance in the area. Kia kaha, said many; our street would be strong again.</p>

         <p id="p25">On the first Wednesday evening, under a bleak damp sky, I flashed my media credentials and went through the central city cordon. Grand old buildings that had come stoically through the 4 September quake &#8211; among them the Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings and the old Christchurch Girls&#8217; High School &#8211; were utterly savaged. The Arts Centre was much worse than before, although in better shape than I had feared. The glorious Cranmer Square corner of the old Christchurch Normal School was smashed. From behind the tight inner cordon I could see up Worcester St to the sorrow of the cathedral, and smell the acrid smoke from the CTV building. Through the wide empty streets there was a silence that was alien and wrong.</p>

         <p id="p26">On the few occasions when we have had time to watch the TV coverage of recovery efforts in the CBD, it has been with a strange emotional distance, as when one observes televised devastation in a foreign country. Yet we are all brutally bound to it. The husband of my daughter&#8217;s school principal is missing in the CTV building, as is the father of one of her good friends. One of our dearest friends was freed, injured and traumatised, after being trapped by a concrete beam in the Press building for two hours.</p>

         <p id="p27">In Aranui, Bexley, New Brighton, Avonside, St Albans, Shirley and beyond, the devastation is vast, but of a different variety to our neighbourhood. Houses are not flattened; instead, they squat bleak and impossibly burdened amid foul lakes of water and stinking silt. Streets have been ripped and buckled by the erupting ground, and chasms have opened up where the earth has spread towards the river. Areas that were hit hard by liquefaction last time have been hit seven, eight times harder, and areas that got away lightly last time have been hammered.</p>

         <p id="p28">As the diggers, trucks, householders and thousands of helpers work furiously to clear it away, the piled-up muck and the thin layer of silt left on the roads dries off and is kicked up by wind and traffic. It lodges in the back of the throat and in the nostrils, gets in the eyes and settles across every surface. The place has the smell and feel of the backstreets of Chennai or Denpasar, not Christchurch. For mile after mile I have cycled through broken streets like this; if there is a solution to it all, I do not yet see it.</p>

         <p id="p29">But so many good things are happening, too. People are (mostly) softer and gentler with one another. Strangers smile. We have reached out to friends who we don&#8217;t see enough of in normal times to give and receive support. Skills and labour are shared.</p>

         <p id="p30">People think of little things that can make such a big difference &#8211; for instance, someone at my husband&#8217;s work, on the largely undamaged western side of town, thought of installing a washing machine for staff who are without water. Others go literally miles out of their way to help &#8211; one friend travelled back and forth to North Canterbury with a water tank, adding to the supplies made available by the authorities. And the Student Army &#8211; now said to number 15,000 &#8211; is an incredible feat of intelligence, vision and organisation: every day, they fan out across the devastation equipped with spades, wheelbarrows, food and dust-masks, clearing the mess and helping to seize order from calamity.</p>

         <p id="p31">Amid the thick sense of loss and tragedy is an immense energy, the kind that comes from giving and doing. It&#8217;s as if we are all like those old-fashioned dynamo bicycle lights, generating energy by expending it; keeping going by keeping going. And there is something primal and affirming about simply making do amid greater need. For 25 years I have held onto the memory of watching a woman on a Tanzanian train scrub her face and her baby&#8217;s with one small palmful of water. I thought of her again one night, before we had water back on, when I managed a perfectly adequate camp shower with a couple of cups of water.</p>

         <p id="p32">We&#8217;ve had a few good laughs. A friend suggested the best way to deploy Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee, who apparently thinks liquefaction is not so bad, is to stick an axle through him and use him as a compactor.</p>

         <p id="p33">On day five I finally found the information I&#8217;d earlier spent a frustrating hour or so searching for on the Earthquake Commission (EQC) website, something about 180,000 people with claims from 4 September need to know: do we file a new claim, or will it be a reassessment of the old one? The answer was buried in verbiage nine paragraphs deep in a press release titled 'EQC focus on emergency repairs'. We all roared at the ineptitude of it.</p>

         <p id="p34">Bill, one of our neighbours whose house is rubble, rang Genesis to cancel the power; the call centre woman said they&#8217;d need to come and do a final meter reading. 'Very well,' said Bill, in his lovely lilting Scots accent, 'if you can find it.'</p>

         <p id="p35">Friends from both ends of the political spectrum are unanimous that the only fit punishment for the low-lifes who stole those emergency generators and for the reporters said to have masqueraded as family members to get into the hospital is to stick them in the stocks beneath a teetering gothic revival tower.</p>

         <p id="p36">There are periods of confidence and periods of despondency. Today, on day eight, I sense a belief in my neighbourhood that our little village can be remade. And there is a profound new awareness around the city of how vital local communities are, of how we must nourish and nurture them, and never again allow them to be neglected by busyness and laziness. Our friend Tony, who lives in the next street, says this is how it must be: we will rebuild the city, village by village.</p>

         <p id="p37">But there is so much worse to come. We don&#8217;t yet have the names of all those who have perished, and we will know more people on that yet-to-be published list. And so many people have seen so much terror. There are those who, from their office windows, saw the CTV building collapse before their very eyes. There are people who ran for their children through streets where people lay fallen; there are those who have seen others just feet away from them crushed by falling masonry; those who have rushed to give aid to the dead and dying. There are times when it seems that this will surely be too much for a little city to bear.</p>

         <p id="p38">And then there is the physical task. People who are working inside the cordon every day say the CBD is decimated, its infrastructure shattered, and that &#8211; aside from the leaning Hotel Grand Chancellor &#8211; other relatively modern high-rises are terminally damaged. It is somehow of little comfort that the Institution of Professional Engineers is reminding its members that the building code is based on international best practice and is designed to deal with the sort of seismic event that will happen every 500 years or so, but that this one was <em>three times</em> that.
         </p>

         <p id="p39">Thousands of businesses need to be relocated before they can trade again, and even if premises can be found for the most important employers in undamaged parts of the city, what of the small central city cafes and shops? Where will they go? And what of the little local strip of shops that have crumpled in places like Opawa, Richmond, Phillipstown, Linwood &#8211; what will become of them?</p>

         <p id="p40">The Government rescue package will help prop things up for now. But the TV crews will be long gone, Geoff and Simon will be broadcasting <em>Morning Report</em> as normal from Wellington, and the international media will have moved to the next disaster by the time the jobs start disappearing.
         </p>

         <p id="p41">I stumble unexpectedly upon fragments of information that tell of the dreadful burden to come. A neighbour who is an orthopaedic registrar at the hospital says people with traumatic crush injuries, of which they have treated many, will require perhaps six or seven further operations. He says about half of Christchurch&#8217;s house surgeons &#8211; the workhorses of the hospital &#8211; are foreigners. He fears that when their contracts roll over &#8211; mostly in August &#8211; many will leave, and many of those signed up to come will stay away.</p>

         <p id="p42">We have asked ourselves 'will we stay?' We have asked our friends and neighbours 'will you stay?' Some won&#8217;t: young people who don&#8217;t own property and have portable skills may feel no tie here; others who have support networks elsewhere, who are renters rather than owners and who simply can&#8217;t bear the shaking and the trauma will see no sense in staying.</p>

         <p id="p43">But for most of us, even if we thought we wanted to go, there really isn&#8217;t a choice. We are economically tied to this solemn place by the fact that our biggest personal asset is here, in the hands of insurers and almost certainly unsaleable. We are emotionally tied here by our neighbours and friends and family. And so we will hold each other up, and we will keep going.</p>

         <p id="p44">But we need a vision of what will be. We need it to be believable and powerfully led, and we need to know the order of progress on the long, long road ahead.</p>

         <p id="p45">Where should the CBD go? What of the suburbs that are swallowed up in liquefied silt? How will we redesign the way we live, so that we are pulled closer to one another and to a rebuilt city? Which few treasures from our architectural heritage shall we decide to salvage and repair as the symbols of our humanity, self-belief and endurance &#8211; for shall we not need an eternal spring from which to draw these strengths?</p>

         <p id="p46">We know from our five-month apprenticeship following 4 September that we hadn&#8217;t properly grasped any of this before, and that things were bumbling and drifting. Most of us had forgotten that the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Commission &#8211; set up by the Government after 4 September &#8211; even existed, let alone known what it was thinking of doing. We need something far more convincing, something that will set us on the right path for the decades to come. Something that can help us hold together, and can bang heads together. Something that will listen to our good sense, but with the good sense to ignore our small-minded, petty, parochial squabbles. Something that will help us reach for what we all want and need &#8211; strong villages that will heal us, strong buildings that we can trust and a strongly beating city heart.</p>
