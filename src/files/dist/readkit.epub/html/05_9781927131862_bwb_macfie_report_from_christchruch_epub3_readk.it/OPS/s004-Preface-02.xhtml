         <p id="p6">Be prepared. That has long been the best advice in dealing with earthquakes and yet we at the <em>Listener</em>, New Zealand&#8217;s leading current affairs magazine, could not have anticipated just how well prepared we were for the devastating series of earthquakes that suddenly hit our second biggest city of Christchurch from late 2010.&#160;
         </p>

         <p id="p7">It was not just that we had as our Christchurch-based writer Rebecca Macfie, one of New Zealand&#8217;s most respected senior journalists and the winner of more than a dozen prestigious awards.</p>

         <p id="p8">And it was not just that, as it transpired, Rebecca was right at the heart of events &#8211; when the second big quake hit Christchurch at 12.51pm on 22 February 2011, killing 185 people and damaging 100,000 homes, she was in her home office in the Port Hills, close to the epicentre.&#160;</p>

         <p id="p9">The distinguishing factor that was to make such a difference to this magazine and its readers was that Rebecca proved herself to be the kind of courageous individual who, although lucky to escape without serious injury from her badly damaged house, almost immediately and against all advice got on her bike &#8211; the only way to traverse otherwise impassable roads &#8211; and began observing, recording and interpreting the traumatic and chaotic scenes of the biggest natural disaster in this nation&#8217;s history.</p>

         <p id="p10">In the long months to come, when Christchurch experienced over 10,000 aftershocks, including some producing ground acceleration at world-record levels, she remained intrepidly at her post as our sole Christchurch reporter, interviewing over 100 people and venturing into the cordoned-off red zone half a dozen times.</p>

         <p id="p11">We agree wholeheartedly with Bridget Williams Books that the enduring insights of Rebecca&#8217;s reports deserve to be shared. Here are lessons from local communities on how best to nourish and support one another in a disaster. Here is advice for emergency services on how to become more efficient in helping shattered communities. Here, too, are helpful observations from those dealing with the tortuously slow processes of insurance claims, geotechnical reports and building assessments.</p>

         <p id="p12">And though Rebecca wrote that at times she felt like 'an observer in someone else&#8217;s disaster movie', she was so directly engaged that she has captured moments not only of struggle and survival but also of optimism and energy. One freezing May night, for example, she joined the efforts to rejuvenate the flattened inner city by learning ceroc, salsa and swing moves among dozens of strangers under the stars. Of all the things she wrote about in her unstable new world, it was the creativity that so surprised us. But then, given that it arises directly from Cantabrians&#8217; compassion for each other, it&#8217;s the thing for which we should most have been prepared.<br/>
