<p>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, KBE (15 October 1881 â€“ 14
February 1975) was a comic writer who enjoyed enormous popular
success during a career of more than seventy years and continues to
be widely read. Despite the political and social upheavals that
occurred during his life, much of which was spent in France and the
United States, Wodehouse's main canvas remained that of pre-war
English upper-class society, reflecting his birth, education, and
youthful writing career. An acknowledged master of English prose,
Wodehouse has been admired both by contemporaries such as Hilaire
Belloc, Evelyn Waugh and Rudyard Kipling and by modern writers such
as Douglas Adams, Salman Rushdie, Zadie Smith and Terry Pratchett.
Sean O'Casey famously called him "English literature's performing
flea", a description that Wodehouse used as the title of a
collection of his letters to a friend, Bill Townend. Best known
today for the Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels and short stories,
Wodehouse was also a playwright and lyricist who was part author
and writer of 15 plays and of 250 lyrics for some 30 musical
comedies. He worked with Cole Porter on the musical Anything Goes
(1934) and frequently collaborated with Jerome Kern and Guy Bolton.
He wrote the lyrics for the hit song "Bill" in Kern's Show Boat
(1927), wrote lyrics to Sigmund Romberg's music for the Gershwin -
Romberg musical Rosalie (1928), and collaborated with Rudolf Friml
on a musical version of The Three Musketeers (1928). Source:
