<p class="hang1">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school in this article used a real-life event&#8212;the 2009 Samoan tsunami&#8212;as the basis for a unit that would enhance learning through curriculum integration. In the unit the students developed an aid project for a devastated school in Samoa.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning from the project covered many subject areas&#8212; literacy, numeracy, the arts, oral language and social studies&#8212;and expanded students&#8217; competency in <i>relating to others</i> and <i>participating and contributing</i>.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project promoted student agency and empowerment in addressing social issues.</p>
<p class="hang1">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key reason for the success of the project was that it was based on an authentic context that was of central interest and concern for the students.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindent">When one student was personally touched by the 2009 Samoan tsunami, Omanu School in the Bay of Plenty launched an aid project that galvanised students into learning that was integrated across many curriculum areas. The students researched, negotiated and problem solved as they sought to make a difference to an event that mattered to them.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">In general, Western education policies reflect a narrowing of curriculum, assessment-driven teaching, reporting to standards and a re-emphasis on individual learning. This trend in education policy has led some to claim that progressive education is dead (Lowe, in the UK, 2007) and that collaborative planning and decision making, as found in curriculum integration, largely eludes schools (Beane, in the US, 2005). New Zealand and Australia&#8217;s current emphasis on numeracy and literacy standards contrasts with the view that learning can be a collaborative process that is socially mediated and negotiated, that is messy and unpredictable and that is not neatly captured by individual assessment results (Nuthall, 2001, 2007).</p>
<p class="indent">Within the current policy environment it is timely to refocus on those approaches that are inquiry rather than subject driven, and that emphasise social concerns and student agency rather than a narrowing of curriculum and assessment. New Zealand has a strong reputation for child-centred learning, and curriculum integration provides a way to preserve this legacy. While New Zealand teachers have long practised various forms, levels and interpretations of integration, the quality of such practice varies enormously, has seldom been researched and relies heavily on convenient, &#8220;common sense&#8221; rituals of practice (Nuthall, 2001) rather than a research base. The unit outlined here reflects the goals of the latest school curriculum (Ministry of Education, 2007), which vests teachers with greater decision-making capacity when it comes to determining curriculum coverage and greater flexibility in terms of subject planning. Moreover, the curriculum is founded on democratic principles, such as young people being actively involved, making contributions to society and taking responsibility for their learning. These goals are also central to curriculum integration. There is a persistent problem, however, which is that we have little research that provides a basis for teachers&#8217; practice in this field, and what does exist provides more confusion and dissent than clarity (as discussed by Dowden, 2006, and Fraser, 2000). This article provides a local case study of how curriculum integration in a New Zealand classroom fosters deep learning and quality inquiry.</p>
<h2 class="left">A devastating event</h2>
<p class="noindent">At 7 am on 29 September 2009, an earthquake of magnitude 8.2 triggered a tsunami which hit Samoa. The worst-affected areas were in the north, including devastation to the villages of Salea&#8217;aumua, Saleapaga and Satitoa on the island of Upolu. Satitoa School was completely destroyed and other schools were so badly water damaged that they were structurally unsafe. Events like this invariably touch New Zealanders deeply, given the numbers of Kiwis of Samoan descent, and the connections New Zealand has culturally and historically with the South Pacific. As with most disasters, after the initial donations, aid started to dry up. Clean-up and rebuilding tended to focus on the tourist spots, but the destruction of homes, schools and communities was largely neglected. Three months later, the nontourist areas still looked like a scene of devastation. Added to this were heavy tropical rains that made transport and rebuilding difficult. The following is a summary of how one New Zealand class responded to the tragedy, and how the children, along with their teacher, learnt that they can make a real difference in even the most difficult circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">When the tsunami struck, a Year 3 girl from Omanu School in the Bay of Plenty was on holiday in Samoa with her mother and Samoan-born grandfather. When she returned to school after the holidays, she shared with her teacher stories of the devastation she had witnessed first hand in Samoa. She and her family had done what they could to support the most affected areas, collecting money from hotel guests and taking supplies to the worst-hit villages. Once back in New Zealand, her mother and teacher discussed ways in which they would sustain a support effort to help rebuild lives in Samoa. The discussion grew to include the class, with the natural catalyst coming from the child&#8217;s experience and her family&#8217;s concern about the after-effects of the disaster. Media coverage also heightened the awareness of the children in the class. With curriculum integration, inquiry usually begins with a central issue of concern that has real personal and social significance for children (Beane, 2005). In this case, the issue included social concerns, consciousness raising and a wide range of learning. These are the goals of curriculum integration, and they align with the aims of <i>The New Zealand Curriculum</i> (Ministry of Education, 2007).</p>
<h2 class="left">Thinking globally, acting locally</h2>
<p class="noindent">The class, in negotiation with their teacher and the child&#8217;s mother, decided to focus their support efforts on Satitoa School. The five-room school had been completely destroyed: all that remained was the concrete pad on which the school had once stood. Focusing in on the school enabled the children to empathise and connect, drawing upon their own experience as school children. However, research was required to piece together what was needed, as the teacher realised that the differences between the two countries could result in offering irrelevant or inappropriate goods and materials. The children&#8217;s need to study the geography, culture and customs of Samoa had a real and urgent purpose. The more they knew, the more likely they were to be able to make a difference. In curriculum integration, an issue or problem is the catalyst for a unit, and this is followed by children identifying their prior knowledge and then investigating what they need to know. Children&#8217;s questions helped to frame their investigation, and these multiplied as they discovered more about Satitoa. These questions included, &#8220;What do they need right now? What had they lost? What might they need in a few weeks&#8217; time? What sorts of food are best to gather? What clothing do they wear? How can we make sure that what we send finds the children that need it? How are the children feeling? Would they like some of my toys? What games do they play?&#8221; Initial thoughts were to get a container and fill it with things that might be useful. However, they soon learnt that there was much more to it than that.</p>
<p class="indent">The children began to list the items required for restocking a school. These included school bags, paper, pencils, books, desks and chairs, shelving units, pinboards, whiteboards, blackboards, fans, filing cabinets and so forth. They soon discovered that school life could not be separated from home and community life. Their research, with the skilful guidance of their teacher, enabled them to also list items that were required by the Samoan school children&#8217;s families and community. As more information about the effects of the tsunami was gathered, they realised the children and their families needed (among other things) clothing for all ages, basic survival and cooking equipment, tools, storage containers for food and water, recreational equipment, buckets, mosquito nets, rakes, brooms and toiletries.</p>
<p class="indent">The class soon realised that to attempt to meet such a vast array of needs they needed to ask for help from the broader local community. Through a series of communications including email, faxes, letters and asking around, the class rallied the support of 16 local schools and kindergartens and a large number of businesses. Over a six-week period the children successfully gathered the teaching and learning materials, games, physical education equipment, storage and shelving, pinboards, clocks, blackboards, stationery, art gear, cleaning and basic maintenance equipment needed to reopen the five-classroom school. Every child from Satitoa School was sent a new school bag with the stationery required for a year&#8217;s education. In addition, one of the most touching things the New Zealand children decided to do was to send each child at Satitoa a care box. Discussion and debate ensued about what should go in the boxes. They decided that the items had to be useful and environmentally appropriate. They thought about what would be gender neutral, as they did not know whether their care box would be received by a girl or a boy. They then listed and debated what might be welcomed by children in Satitoa. As these care boxes would go to individual children, they added a personal touch by including a hand-written letter, introducing themselves and saying how they were thinking of the children of Satitoa. The care boxes contained items such as marbles, skipping ropes, puppets, toiletries, soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste, comics, sunglasses and hats.</p>
<p class="indent">As news of the classroom&#8217;s aid event spread, many businesses came on board, donating a range of goods. A parent donated an old rusty shipping container in which the class could house and transport the donated goods. A trucking company then offered to paint and signwrite on the container to spruce it up. Pacific Blue Airlines donated three air tickets so that the teacher, mother and grandfather could collect the container when it docked. They also worked with the Samoan Ministry of Education, the local council of matai and disaster relief co-ordinators to ensure that cultural protocols were observed and to ensure the delivery of goods to the new school site.</p>
<h2 class="left">Curriculum connections</h2>
<p class="noindent">Clearly, an extensive project like this draws on many curriculum subject areas. These are outlined briefly below, and examples of the children&#8217;s learning are given:</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematics&#8212;measurement of blackboards and pinboards, capacity (how many banana boxes fit in a shipping container), time (international time differences, shipping dates and passages), statistics (graphing to keep track of ideas and results), numeracy (keeping track of purchases and donations, counting in multiples such as 20 tennis balls per bag), money and problem solving (how many pairs of scissors does a class and a school need, what is the total cost and can it be afforded?).</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICT&#8212;emails, faxes, Internet searches, camera and video use for record keeping.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arts&#8212;examining the dance, music and visual art of Samoa.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading and writing&#8212;making posters to advertise fundraising, emails and faxes to and from local schools and businesses, emails from the Samoan Ministry of Education, letters to children in Satitoa, writing notes home and reminders, scripting speeches.</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral language&#8212;hosting guests and sharing learning, negotiating a bargain with various businesses, preparing thank you speeches, preparing questions for visiting experts (e.g., Samoan family members, workers at Bunnings, when working with other adults on joint projects).</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social studies&#8212;understanding that people have social, cultural and economic roles, rights and responsibilities; understanding how time and change affect people&#8217;s lives; understanding how places influence people and people influence places.</p>
<p class="noindent">All the key competencies were evident within this integrated unit, but in particular the learning the children undertook highlighted <i>relating to others</i> and <i>participating and contributing</i>. In the former they were involved in negotiating the aid project with classmates, their teacher, the wider school, other schools, homes and businesses. They were actively involved in problem solving, investigating and being creative. The children ran some hard bargains with building companies and sought the best prices. However, they soon learnt that a number of places would donate materials once they knew what the purpose was. In terms of <i>participating and contributing</i>, they experienced first hand what it means to be part of a community project, what it means to contribute beyond the needs of oneself and one&#8217;s family and what it means to support people in another country. Such experiences underline the moral challenge in education; teachers do not just teach subjects. Whether it is overt or not, everything that is taught is values-laden, and values underpin what it means to be educated. Again <i>The New Zealand Curriculum</i> (Ministry of Education, 2007) is reflected in the project with its values emphasis on:</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inquiry into what was needed in Satitoa</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diversity in terms of Samoan culture</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equity in regards to supporting others in times of need</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustainability in terms of ongoing community, village and school life</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respect for local Samoan protocols</p>
<p class="hang">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contribution to &#8220;the common good&#8221; (p. 10).</p>
<p class="noindent">Brough (2008, p. 13) notes that during curriculum integration, values and key competencies &#8220;are not add-ons taught through isolated lessons; rather, they are interwoven throughout&#8221;. For teachers wanting to emulate a rich inquiry such as this one, the first step is to take notice of the events that have real significance for their children and their families. These are the events that concern them and have keen relevance for their lives. Inviting questions, devising plans, negotiating investigations, refining ideas and contacting community members all stem from a need to know&#8212;they are not driven by assessment requirements or by a completely preplanned unit of work.</p>
<h2 class="left">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="noindent">This article provides a case study of curriculum integration where a teacher and her class collaboratively investigated the needs of a Samoan school devastated by a tsunami. The project included a variety of community support and involvement. The children drew upon a range of curriculum areas and key competencies within the authentic context of the extensive aid project. In effect, this integrated project reflects the curriculum goal of children as &#8220;active seekers, users and creators of knowledge&#8221; (Ministry of Education, 2007, p. 8). Moreover, it provides an example of promoting children&#8217;s agency through socially responsive activism.</p>
<p class="indent">Proponents of national standards in numeracy and literacy have much to consider here. Not only was numeracy and literacy evident in the children&#8217;s learning, there was a clear, relevant and important purpose for working with number and words. The work the children undertook was far beyond the fulfilment of an assessment task or the completion of a set class activity. The children were involved in negotiations and decisions that had implications for the quality of life of others, and they showed the grit and compassion to follow the project through. Barker (2005) reminds us that we must not steal the learning from our students. If we focus too narrowly on certain targets and assessments, we miss the deeper goals that emerge during an integrated project of this nature. Even children as young as Year 3 can be fully involved in an aid project that expands their sense of responsibility and contribution; that enables them to appreciate their capacity to make a difference. As Beane asserts, children deserve a curriculum that takes them seriously as change agents:</p>
<p class="blockquote">The work they do should involve more making and doing, more building and creating, and less of the deadening drudgery that too many of our curriculum arrangements call for. We should ask that the curriculum challenge our young people to imagine a better world and try out ways of making it so. We should ask that it bring them justice and equity, that it help them to overcome the narrow prejudices still so evident in our society. (2005, p. 136)</p>
<p class="noindent">The work the class undertook was highly collaborative, socially mediated and negotiated. The groundswell of support they engendered from the wider community says much about the worth of the cause. This example of curriculum integration shows that limitations are few and possibilities are many. And through the process, both teacher and children learn it is not too bold to imagine, and create, a better world.</p>
