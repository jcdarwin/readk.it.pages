<p class="noindent">The of use mobile technologies such as cellphones offers unique capabilities to help facilitate social interaction between students and support collaboration between home and school. This article reports on research into the use of cellphones to support student learning in a low-decile urban primary school. The school used the phones as an innovative way to provide formative feedback to parents. The initiative is having significant benefits for students and is enhancing the relationship between home and school.</p>

<h2 class="left">The use of mobile technologies to support student learning</h2>
<p class="noindent">The advent of small portable digital devices (mobile or mTechnology) able to deliver information in a range of formats to learners on an anywhere, anytime basis, according to Kukulska-Hulme and Traxler (2007), has &#8220;considerable pedagogic potential, and in some cases, unique pedagogic potential&#8221; (p. 181). They align this potential with four key elements of learning design, by stating that mTechnology is uniquely placed to &#8220;support designs for learning where access, inclusion, opportunity and participation in learning are priorities&#8221; (p. 183), while at the same time providing elements of personalisation, &#8220;situatedness&#8221; and authenticity more traditional or &#8220;tethered&#8221; eLearning technologies are unable to offer. While acknowledging this potential, Kukulska-Hulme and Traxler also comment on the tendency of mLearning to be &#8220;defined in terms of its technology&#8212;its devices and its hardware&#8221; (p. 181), largely ignoring the <i>nature</i> of learning possible through using such devices, including their ability to more readily contribute to social knowledge development and understanding through facilitating greater interaction and collaboration, often linked to authentic &#8220;in the field&#8221; learning and social situations. They see the device-oriented view as &#8220;constraining and technocentric&#8221; (p. 181). It limits our capacity to view any impact mTechnology may have on the overall learner experience, including the development of social and collaborative learning networks, and its capacity for enhancing student learning, motivation and engagement.</p>
<p class="indent">Pioneering programmes, such as the mLearningAfrica<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ft1">1</a></sup> project, have been using mTechnologies, particularly smartphones, to deliver literacy, health and social education programmes to remote village and low-income urban populations where fixed-line network services and access to desktop computers is severely limited. Studies associated with these programmes identified significant advantages from the use of mobile phones to promote awareness of issues such as HIV/Aids, and to help reduce social isolation and build greater intercultural awareness, competencies and social skills, particularly in &#8220;at risk&#8221; youth populations (Botha, Vosloo, Kuner, &#38; van den Berg, 2009). These findings are consistent with other studies of a similar nature, for example Chigona, Beukes, Vally and Tanner (2009), who concluded that &#8220;mobile internet (via smartphones) has a significant impact in addressing exclusion from social participation (although) its impact on economic as well as political dimensions of exclusions is still limited&#8221; (p. 1). While these projects did not attempt to quantify any direct &#8220;learning gain&#8221; from the use of mTechnologies, they did identify their value as powerful conduits for fostering communication and assisting in relationship formation, particularly amongst disaffected and isolated youth populations.</p>
<p class="indent">Closer to home, innovative local educators such as Nathan Kerr have been exploring the use of cellphones as &#8220;study aids&#8221; for assisting his South Auckland students to &#8220;bridge the (learning) gap by acting as a platform to receive and store information&#8221; (Microsoft, 2008, p. 1). Through the use of innovative software, Kerr has been using the cellphones as mobile information &#8220;storehouses&#8221; where his students are able to &#8220;create visual records of information, compress them, and transmit the file onto mobile devices as ever-ready study notes&#8221; (Microsoft, 2008, p. 1). According to him, the use of mobile phones in this way contributed to enhanced student motivation and engagement in learning beyond that which could be attributed to &#8220;the novelty value of having class notes on their cellphones&#8221; (Microsoft, 2008, p. 1). He commented that the real value lay in their ability to more easily bring students together in learning collaborations which are student-driven, using a device that &#8220;they know a lot more about than I do. It&#8217;s collaboration through and through&#8221; (Kerr, 2008, p. 1). This project is similar to initiatives such as the Qualcomm-funded Project K&#8217;Nect in North Carolina, which also adopted a content-focused model, working with students to use cellphones to raise achievement levels in mathematics. Consistent with Kerr&#8217;s findings, research from this project indicated that while students found the availability of content for learning, revision and consolidation purposes via smartphone useful, the real value lay in their ability to use the devices to &#8220;learn from each other in and out of the classroom. Students did so by using social networking applications on the smartphone, as well as other Internet resources such as <a href="http://www.algebra.com">algebra.com</a>&#8221; (Shuler, 2009, p. 1). Ultimately, this study concluded that the networking and communicative capacity of the phones in bringing students together to help and support each other&#8217;s mathematics learning was as important, if not more so, than their ability to transmit and store content.</p>
<p class="indent">Another earlier New Zealand initiative that was undertaken as part of the Ministry of Education&#8217;s Digital Opportunities projects followed a similar theme, by exploring the use of mobile phones to develop communication &#8220;bridges&#8221; and foster collaboration between the school, students and parents of immigrant families. This project, known as &#8220;Digital Bridges&#8221;, supplied prepaid mobile phones to Somalian and selected other students, with the aim being to explore ways in which they might assist them to form relationships with others in the school, instead of maintaining their tendency to interact only with students of their own ethnicity or culture. The cellphones were set up for text-only use (using $10 text), and after some tutoring were used by the students for a range of purposes, including activities set up by the teachers which required them to use the phones to collaborate in mixed groups to solve learning problems, complete spelling and word puzzles and also for homework and school notice reminders. In addition, the students were encouraged to use the phones to make contact with each other to arrange in and out of school activities, and for other informal communication.</p>
<p class="indent">Consistent with previous studies, data from research undertaken during this project indicated that the phones served a useful function in helping to break down the initial social isolation barrier these immigrant students experienced when coming to a new country, culture and school, and helped them integrate and interact more positively in their new environment (Winter, 2007). Data suggest that by using the phones as an initial and ongoing mode of contact and for purposes where students needed to work together to solve problems, issues related to cultural and sometimes physical differences were diminished, and the shyness or reluctance of new students to communicate and work with others decreased. According to Winter (2007), following the implementation of the project teachers also noted higher levels of informal face-to-face interaction between the students (for example, in the playground), and more integration in formal classroom activities. While Winter (2007) didn&#8217;t draw any direct causal links between the project and these observations, he commented that it would not be unreasonable to draw such a conclusion, although the precise contribution the project made to such occurrences would be difficult to assess, as it was only one component of a number of school initiatives at the time targeted at achieving such outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">Another New Zealand study on the use of cellphones in schools was undertaken at Vardon School in Hamilton by researchers Kay Petchell and Ted Glynn, and was the subject of an article in a previous issue of <i><b>set:</b> Research Information for Teachers</i> (Petchell &#38; Glynn, 2009). This case study reviewed cellphones as a tool for behaviour-modification purposes. The school was finding that members of their school community were increasingly unavailable via conventional landlines and &#8220;resolved to explore texting as a means of communicating daily with the caregivers of those students who were presenting with challenging behaviours&#8221; (Petchell &#38; Glynn, 2009, p. 39). Although the focus of this study was on behaviour rather than any impact on learning, there are some similarities in the outcomes to those found in this research. The Vardon study found that it is becoming increasingly necessary for schools to reconsider the manner by which they communicate with parents and caregivers: &#8220;if we believe it is to our benefit as teachers to have parents in partnership with us, we are going to have to communicate with them on terms which are familiar, accessible and acceptable to them&#8221; (Petchell &#38; Glynn, 2009, p. 42). This study suggests there are significant benefits to be gained from cellphones as an effective means for communicating instantly and regularly with large numbers of community members.</p>
<p class="indent">While acknowledging the limitations of this brief review, it does indicate areas of value that using mTechnologies can add to student learning, especially when used to build collaboration and foster interaction and relationships between students, teachers and the home. The following study introduces a variation on this theme, by exploring the use of mobile phones to help support affective and behavioural change in students, through their use as devices for instant communication between school and home.</p>
<h2 class="left">Introduction to the study</h2>
<p class="noindent">This study describes and analyses outcomes from one of a series of three case studies examining various tools that are in use as deliberate means of communication to connect schools with parents and caregivers in the home. The study is part of doctoral research being undertaken at the University of Waikato. Each of the case studies focuses on a different tool and the purpose for, and outcomes from, its use, as identified by the school. The first study examined a more commonly adopted pen and paper approach to establishing communication. The second looked at the development of a school &#8220;culture&#8221; whereby the means of communication is inherent in the way the school community interacts together, while the third analysed the use of mobile phones to convey messages between students, home and school. It is this third study that is of particular significance to this article because it involved the use of mTechnologies, although its comparison with the other studies also has relevance. The mobile phone study was conducted at Rhode Street Primary School in Hamilton. The initiative, known as &#8220;Phone Home Good News&#8221;, began in 2006, and was extended in 2008 to include support staff personnel who were involved with students. The initiative continues strongly today as an integral component of the school&#8217;s innovative approach to learning.</p>
<h2 class="left">Background</h2>
<p class="noindent">The Rhode Street &#8220;Phone Home Good News&#8221; initiative had its beginnings at a hui (gathering) attended by staff in 2006. During this hui a discussion developed regarding the benefits many believed would eventuate if students were able to connect with their wh&#228;nau (family) instantly, and on a more regular basis. The staff believed the advantages of communicating in such a manner would include allowing students to share their good news and achievements in &#8220;real time&#8221;, and the development of better relationships between home and school through opportunities for reciprocal communication as parents are able to both respond to and initiate messages. As the vast majority of families (over 90 percent) had access to a mobile phone, it was considered that this medium was an appropriate means of achieving the goal. Not only did mobile phones meet the criteria of enabling instant and more regular contact, they also allowed for flexibility in the means of communication through the use of text, voice or video messaging, depending on which was deemed most appropriate and respectful at the time. While options such as emailing or blogs are being effectively used in other schools, they did not meet the criteria of this initiative, as they did not enable &#8220;reach&#8221; to as many families, nor did they allow the contact to be made on an &#8220;anytime, anywhere&#8221; basis, as a mobile device does.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to achieve the goal of this initiative, it was necessary to provide each teacher with a mobile phone; however, the cost of this was over and above the budget allowance the school had at its discretion. As a result the principal, Shane Ngatai, sought sponsorship, as he was keen to support the proposal. He fully appreciated the benefits such an initiative could offer the students, and he also believed that it would embrace the school values of respect, learn and grow, a stance also supported by the school board of trustees. When Vodafone confirmed their sponsorship in 2006, the initiative began almost immediately.</p>
<h2 class="left">Implementing the initiative</h2>
<p class="noindent">Before introducing this initiative there were some careful considerations discussed by staff in order to ensure that the quality and original aims of the initiative remained consistent. These included agreement that contact with home was only to be made with the approval of the teacher or support staff personnel working with the child. Additionally, contact should be made by the child wherever possible, although teachers could sometimes contact family members as they were marking work after school, or to text reminders to home regarding forthcoming events, such as class presentations or sporting and cultural occasions. To enable contact to be made by the students, often younger students made a phone call while more senior students were able to text their message. Each contact was recorded on the eTap school management system (SMS) which required the staff member to write brief details about each call, including the student&#8217;s name, the purpose for the communication and a summary of the message. Although this created some additional work for the teachers, it provided the school with valuable records detailing the history of their interactions. In doing this the school was able to support both teachers and students by ensuring each student was being offered regular opportunities to connect with their wh&#228;nau, and the information was also useful for reporting back to the board of trustees and sponsors. The teachers&#8217; eTap data entries also recorded the purpose of the call as having a positive or negative focus, and a history of individual student records could be made instantly available&#8212;a feature helpful in recognising various behavioural or learning patterns, concerns or celebrations.</p>
<p class="indent">Another issue to be resolved as the initiative became established was how to cater for students whose families did not have a mobile phone, and could otherwise feel left out. In such cases, it was decided that these students could make mobile phone contact with other staff members, such as leadership personnel. These messages were followed up by the leadership team, effectively allowing contact with close to 100 percent of the school roll. Some issues still arose when phone numbers weren&#8217;t updated or phones were out of order, but because both parents and students were keen to maintain communication, most were efficient at contacting the school with new phone numbers or information regarding damaged or lost phones.</p>
<h2 class="left">Research method</h2>
<p class="noindent">In order to develop a metaphoric &#8220;lens&#8221; through which to interpret the outcomes from the studies, an activity theory methodology was adopted (Vygotsky, 1994). This approach may be conceptualised as a triangle that incorporates examining an activity in terms of three main components: the <i>tool</i> being used, the <i>participants</i> involved and the <i>purpose</i> of the activity. An <i>outcome</i> is discussed following deeper analysis of the interrelationships between these three main components.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of the Rhode Street study, the <i>tool</i> being used was the mobile phone. There was a range of <i>participants</i> involved, including the principal and leadership personnel, teaching and support staff, board of trustees, students and family members. Representatives from each of these groups were interviewed during this study. The <i>purpose</i> of the initiative from the perspective of the school had been discussed and written into a policy statement. It was agreed from the outset that the emphasis was to be on facilitating positive dialogue and communication between school and home with an emphasis on student achievement. Its purpose from the perspective of the students and family members was examined further through the researcher&#8217;s interview process. <i>Outcomes</i> were partially determined by consistencies between the participants&#8217; responses to the question related to purpose, and additionally, to their response regarding outcomes that were apparent for them. The activity theory methodology allowed for detailed analysis of the complexity of interrelationships and opinions that existed between participants, and revealed some significant and common themes. Themes were generated and data coded using Braun and Clarke&#8217;s (2006) thematic analysis model, with relevant quotes being extracted to provide illustrations and examples as detailed below.</p>
<h2 class="left">Findings</h2>
<p class="noindent">The findings were very encouraging from the perspective of all participants, and, furthermore, many consistencies emerged within the data. The themes that became apparent related to a variety of topics, including the positive outcomes of the initiative, improvement in student attitudes and enhanced communication between home and school and also within families. Almost all interviewees had a statement to make regarding the positive difference this initiative made to communication between students, home and school. Often this was further explained by saying they believed that this initiative had greatly contributed to improved relationships and understandings of each other. The following quotes offer short statements related to this theme from each of the participant groups:</p>
<p class="blockquote">I feel involved at the very moment, it makes me feel a part of the schooling system and everything he&#8217;s going through, and I really appreciate that because when he comes home I can back up whatever his teacher has done or put in place and explain it more thoroughly. (Family member F, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote1">It helps with your learning so that you can get to share it with your wh&#257;nau&#8212;what you are doing at school&#8212;and that builds up your confidence. It makes learning so much more fun. Mum said it will give me the perfect education. (Year 7 student, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote1">If their parents are talking positively about it at home because they got a positive call, then that child is going to have a positive outlook on learning as well. (Leadership, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote1">This programme has broken down lots of barriers as many parents were shy about coming into school because their own experiences hadn&#8217;t been positive, but this programme builds relationships which have helped to break down many of those barriers. (Classroom teacher F, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Parents comment on the effectiveness of the instant communication which helps to reinforce home&#8211;school relationships. (Support staff C, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="noindent">Although this is just a small sample of statements made regarding improved home&#8211;school relationships attributable to this initiative, these quotes offer further explanation of the benefits participants have experienced. The specific benefits commented on in these particular quotes included consistency of messages between students, home and school; support or backup from home; improved student efficacy and motivation; reduced barriers for parents through regular, positive communication; families feeling more comfortable about involvement with school; and also encouragement from as many people as possible who are involved with the students&#8212;such as support staff personnel, leadership and teaching staff and the wider circle of family members.</p>
<p class="indent">While these statements helped to clarify some of the main themes emerging, there were also other notable comments made, such as appreciation from both sides for the opportunity to be involved in reciprocal communication. Teachers remarked that parents not only responded to texts, but that they also initiated messages. Their communications to school could include messages for the teacher or their child, but they could also be related to the sharing of family news, such as a new baby or an event their child has been involved in, or a death in the family. All messages were helpful means of building better understandings between students, home and school.</p>
<p class="indent">There were also a significant number of comments made by participant groups regarding improvements to student attitudes. It is noteworthy that the students themselves were also aware of their improved work habits, and attribute this to their eagerness to make a phone call home:</p>
<p class="blockquote">It (the phone) actually makes you work harder so you can use your time wisely and then you get to phone home.</p>
<p class="blockquote">(Year 7 student, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote1">My behaviour has improved with the phoning home.</p>
<p class="blockquote">It helps me so I can learn. (Year 8 student, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="noindent">Comments such as these were quite common amongst the students. They regularly remarked that this initiative had led to increased motivation and self-efficacy, which they said helped them to improve their work habits and behaviour. Both teachers and parents had similar comments to make. One teacher stated that &#8220;rewards come intrinsically and extrinsically&#8221; (Classroom teacher G, interview transcript, 2009) and, reflecting on the students&#8217; thinking, a member of the leadership team commented:</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8230; if they&#8217;re caught being good then actually something intrinsic will happen about that, it won&#8217;t just be a certificate at assembly on Friday &#8230; parents will actually get to hear about it and have the opportunity to share that and that&#8217;s powerful for them, umm &#8230; it strengthens their own self-worth, their confidence. (Leadership A, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="noindent">A parent commented that her daughter was &#8220;pretty proud of herself for getting to ring home&#8221; (Parent A, interview transcript, 2009).</p>
<p class="indent">All parents interviewed spoke of their appreciation of being able to have more regular contact from school about their children, and that they were grateful that this contact was so often positive. At the time of this study during 2009, 86 percent of calls and 92 percent of texts were positive in nature. Furthermore, parents often commented on the contrast between this approach and their previous less positive experiences of school communication with home:</p>
<p class="blockquote">I know when it did first start, I know a lot of parents were probably thinking, &#8216;oh no, what&#8217;s happened&#8217;, you know, &#8216;cause usually that&#8217;s the only time they were contacted was if your child was sick or if they&#8217;d made a wrong choice and so when it started they&#8217;d be like &#8216;oh no, what&#8217;s happened?&#8217;. You know, they always thought the negatives and I think it&#8217;s slowly changed. I think we&#8217;ve done it in three years &#8230; umm &#8230; it&#8217;s changed their way of thinking and it&#8217;s like &#8216;hey, it&#8217;s not always negative they&#8217;re ringing about, it&#8217;s mostly positive&#8217;. (Parent K, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote1">I look forward to those phone calls, actually, and I actually think I can get about two phone calls in one week from my son and it just makes my day. Those phone calls from my kids at school, they really make my day. (Parent C, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="noindent">Almost all students commented on their eagerness to share their good news with their family, as all were very keen and receptive to the opportunity to receive positive feedback from home, as illustrated by these examples:</p>
<p class="blockquote">I write better so I can phone home. (Year 3 student, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote1">If you be good you get to phone home and I like to phone home. (Year 3 student, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote">It makes me work harder. (Year 6 student, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote">I think that everything that I learn and I&#8217;ve done a great job with it, it just feels terrific to share it with my parents. (Year 7 student, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote">We try harder so that we can call home more often. (Year 8 student, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote">It helps my learning so that I focus and know not to talk and stuff so I can phone home for positives. (Year 8 student, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="noindent">Some staff also made reference to the additional feedback from home making a positive difference to student outcomes, and there was a degree of certainty and consistency in their responses related to this point:</p>
<p class="blockquote">&#8230; it definitely helps, as talking through their learning helps to reinforce and reaffirm what they have learnt. (Classroom teacher E, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote">It definitely helps their learning as they can share immediately. (Classroom teacher D, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="noindent">It was also interesting and rewarding to hear many participants comment on the difference this initiative had made to family relationships. These differences were often attributed to improved communication at home being the outcome of improved parental knowledge of the achievements, progress and activities of their child. School personnel made similar comments:</p>
<p class="blockquote">It helps communication to build between students and their parents, as parents are more informed about what their children have been doing. (Support staff C, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="blockquote">Parents are spending more time with their children. (Classroom teacher I, interview transcript, 2009)</p>
<p class="noindent">Such data indicate the significant and diverse benefits from this initiative for the enhancement of relationships between school and home, between parents and their children and for improving student attitude and engagement. The following section discusses these and other relevant findings with reference to the use of mTechnologies, and the impact of the initiative on student learning motivation.</p>
<h2 class="left">Discussion of findings</h2>
<p class="noindent">Data indicated that one of the principal reasons for the success of this initiative related to the real-time synchronous communication afforded by the use of cellphones. The advantages of cellphone use in this study included the reach to a large number of families (over 90 percent); instant communication; more regular contact; flexibility of use in terms of text, voice or video options; and the enhancement of convenient reciprocal communication. Using mobile phones also allowed the students to be involved in the contact, as it was the students who often made the calls. Involving the students directly in this process was significant, as it reinforced ownership and self-responsibility. Direct student involvement is viewed as an important feature of successful home&#8211;school partnerships (Bull, Brooking, &#38; Campbell, 2008), but is often seen as difficult to implement effectively. However, through the use of mobile phones where students, teachers and family members can communicate together and share achievements and special events, often as they are happening, such issues can be effectively addressed.</p>
<p class="indent">However, while it may be nice to receive these calls, the question still remains as to the purpose of this initiative, and whether or not it is helping to improve outcomes for students, and just what these outcomes might be. Bull et al. (2008) examined seven case studies of successful home&#8211;school partnerships in New Zealand in their 2008 Ministry of Education report, Successful Home&#8211;School Partnerships. They concluded that it was very difficult to secure direct evidence that links home&#8211; school partnerships to improved learning outcomes for students, &#8220;given the complexity of the school context and the myriad of initiatives and strategies operating at any particular time&#8221; (Bull et al., 2008, p. 10).</p>
<p class="indent">During the Rhode Street study, there was a discussion related to the possibility of linking the number of calls recorded on the eTap system with changes in student learning or behavioural outcomes, and although anecdotally, according to all participants, the initiative seems to be &#8220;making a difference&#8221;, it would be difficult to state a direct correlation between the two without taking into account other contributing factors. However, the consistency in responses related to attitudinal change since the introduction of this initiative, and the eagerness of students to connect with their families, is worth examining more closely.</p>
<p class="indent">The link between attitudes and educational achievement was a topic raised by the New Zealand Ministry of Education in 2006. They reported that &#8220;it was apparent that a positive attitude did reflect to a small degree, greater educational success&#8221; (Ministry of Education, 2006, p. 8). Furthermore, they wrote that &#8220;because appropriate encouragement from home and school leads to schooling success, it is important students know what others think of their abilities&#8221; (p. 8). As mentioned earlier, the students in this study were very keen to receive feedback from home as it was a meaningful, authentic discussion they were having with their family. They found that the discussion helped to inspire them, which is a finding supported by Petchell and Glynn (2009), who wrote that &#8220;almost universally, pre and early teen children want to please their parents&#8221; (p. 41).</p>
<p class="indent">This feedback, together with the feedback they received from their classroom teacher, did appear to benefit the students according to the students themselves, their families and their teachers. The teachers commented that the family often responded during the call or text by quite briefly praising their child, but the students said that this was often followed up at home with questions, discussion and further praise or rewards. This further reinforces the comments made earlier by Kukulska-Hulme and Traxler (2007) that mLearning has the ability to facilitate greater interaction and collaboration when it is linked to authentic situations and purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">The focus of this initiative and the consistency of messages between home and school also helped to ensure that the original intention remained central to the purpose for communication; that is, that the messages were mainly positive and that they essentially related to student achievement. It has been the case in some school initiatives that the focus becomes purely relationship building, which can lead to less encouraging outcomes (Timperley &#38; Robinson, 2002). However, in this study, relationships were being fostered alongside student achievement, and more importantly, the purpose for communication was shared and understood by all participants&#8212;this being made explicit from the outset. The purpose was discussed and agreed to between staff and parents, and it is written into a school policy statement and available for the community to view on the school website.</p>
<h2 class="left">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="noindent">To view a mobile device such as a cellphone solely as a tool for delivering content for academic purposes, or for student networking, could be seen as limiting the potential use of mTechnology to support learning. This study alludes to its usefulness as a tool to aid authenticity and to improve attitudes and motivation through synchronous communication focused on student achievement. It is a model that has been, and will continue to be, rolled out to many more schools, if challenges of cost and collaboration in planning associated with the implementation of an initiative such as this can be addressed. There are other schools engaged in similar initiatives&#8212;for example, from within the Digital Opportunities projects referred to earlier in this article and the Vardon School example, although the focus and purpose of each initiative vary. While this study has identified one possible use for mTechnologies in schools which may be seen as a little different from prevailing or more conventional uses, its results suggest that the scope and nature of benefits from using mTechnologies for educational purposes may need reconceptualising.</p>
