<p>Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (October 16, 1854 â€“
November 30, 1900) was an Irish playwright, novelist, poet, and
short story writer. Known for his barbed wit, he was one of the
most successful playwrights of late Victorian London, and one of
the greatest celebrities of his day. As the result of a famous
trial, he suffered a dramatic downfall and was imprisoned for two
years of hard labour after being convicted of the offence of "gross
indecency". The scholar H. Montgomery Hyde suggests this term
implies homosexual acts not amounting to buggery in British
legislation of the time. Source: Wikipedia</p>
