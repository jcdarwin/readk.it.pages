<p class="noindent">Morris looks into his bedroom, half-expecting the bed to contain a pile of clothes or an old man sleeping. But if there ever was an old man, or even the ghost of an old man, he’s been chased away by the schmuck who now stands steadying himself on the doorframe and wondering what he’s doing there.</p>

<p class="indent">Smack your forehead. Retrace your steps.</p>

<p class="indent">He’s halfway down the passage before he remembers: his jacket and car keys.</p>

<p class="indent">&#160;</p>

<p class="noindent">It’s cold in the car. Morris turns the heater on, the radio louder. It’s almost time for the news and, after that, the weather.</p>

<p class="indent">Sadie used to get irritated by his interest in the weather. ‘It doesn’t matter what the weather is,’ she’d say, ‘we’ll get on with things.’ Or, if she was talking to the children, ‘Never mind the weather, as long as we’re together.’</p>

<p class="indent">But this time she would understand. If Sadie were here, she too would be leaning towards the car’s single speaker. She too would be squinting up at the clouds, trying to work out whether they were getting heavier or lighter.</p>

<p class="indent">The news starts with a report about the opening of the Arctic Sea Route. The European Space Agency has formally announced that the shortest route between Europe and Asia is, for the first time since records began, fully clear of ice, and navigable.</p>

<p class="indent">The newsreader’s voice is deep, composed. Morris is grateful for his measured pace as he advises of the political battles which the new route may create. Measured is the correct pace for such news.</p>

<p class="indent">Excitement is not correct, but excitement is what Morris had felt that morning at breakfast when he’d read in the newspaper about the opening of the route. He’d known, as soon as he felt it, that he shouldn’t allow himself even the slightest thrill at the thought of the earth’s layers stripping away, ice floe by ice floe. Global warming was not something to be thrilled about. But still—all that stripping away! It made him think of ancient artefacts coming to the surface, of new worlds opening up. Tall men wearing heavy coats and fur-covered boots were captaining ships, forging forwards. They grew their beards long to keep out the cold.</p>

<p class="indent">At breakfast he’d tried to imagine the melting of the Arctic ice. He’d told himself what to picture: a white expanse, nothing but white, and then, through the middle of it, shaped like a series of lightning bolts, grey cracks which widened and grew, fracturing the ice on either side.</p>

<p class="indent">You need to close your eyes to imagine it, he’d told himself. There’s no one here to see you. Just close them and try to picture it. First there’s nothing &#8230; </p>

<p class="indent">Had it been a black nothing, it would have been as simple as closing his eyes and seeing what he saw. But to imagine white—that was too hard. Maybe Sadie could have done that.</p>

<p class="indent">He’d run his hands over the toast crumbs on the table, embarrassed himself with the thought that he was like a blind man reading Braille, and opened his eyes to wipe the crumbs into his cupped hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps his mistake had been in trying first to imagine nothing. Ice isn’t nothing. There’s never really nothing. He knows that.</p>

<p class="indent">&#160;</p>

<p class="noindent">As a boy Morris had a Bible Studies teacher with a huge black beard and deep booming voice.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Before the creation, what was there?’</p>

<p class="indent">Hands flew up. ‘Nothing.’ ‘Nothing.’ ‘Nothing.’</p>

<p class="indent">The black beard shook from side to side. ‘Now I will teach you something. There wasn’t nothing. There was something worse.’</p>

<p class="indent">He paused. The room was silent.</p>

<p class="indent">‘I’ll tell you what there was—there was chaos.’</p>

<p class="indent">Chaos. Morris felt the word catch in the back of his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Chaos,’ boomed the black beard. ‘Chaos and disorder. A muddle of wild and waste.’</p>

<p class="indent">Some teachers would have joked about things being as chaotic as the playground at lunch time. One teacher would have made jokes about Morris’s handwriting. ‘Quite a chaotic jumble of letters we have here. Or am I the confused one and is this actually a drawing? Yes, yes, I see it now. This isn’t handwriting. It’s a picture of an aeroplane. I’m right, aren’t I? An aeroplane flying upside down with its wing on fire.’</p>

<p class="indent">Black Beard did not make jokes. He knew that muddle was not to be taken lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">He made them close their eyes to try to imagine. ‘Screw them up tightly. We’re not having an afternoon nap. We’re trying to imagine something horrible. Tighter. Tighter. So tightly you can hear it in your ears.’</p>

<p class="indent">Morris screwed his eyes tighter. He listened to his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">‘When you first close your eyes, you think you’re seeing only darkness.’ Black Beard lowered his voice. ‘But look closer. There are imperfections in the dark. There’s wildness and disorder. See those creases and particles in front of your eyes?’</p>

<p class="indent">Morris pressed his hands over his eyes, and the darkness started creasing.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Imagine that each one of those imperfections is huge, gigantic. Monstrous and constantly changing. The imperfections bump into each other, splinter, re-form. Now focus on one of those monstrous heaps of matter. One minute it looks like liquid, and the next it’s a thin strand wrapped around blackness which is moving and changing, and now it’s a hard sharp light changed into wet cotton wool which is pulling apart into a blur of chaos and movement and grating energy going nowhere. There’s nothing for your mind to hold on to. You don’t know up from down.’</p>

<p class="indent">You don’t know up from down. There’s nothing for your mind to hold on to.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris pulled his hands away from his eyes. He was gazing into his lap when Black Beard said, ‘Before you open your eyes, I want you to remind yourselves that you have not even begun to imagine the horror of the chaos that was before the creation.’</p>

<p class="indent">The room was quite silent.</p>

<p class="indent">‘That,’ said the teacher, ‘is the real miracle of creation. God gave us something to hold on to. He brought order. Form and matter. Direction to our energy.’</p>

<p class="indent">Order, thought Morris. Direction to our energy.</p>

<p class="indent">A few days later, when his Uncle Norman asked how his lessons were going, Morris didn’t say, ‘Fine thank you.’ He told him about the teacher with the black beard and how God brought order where previously there was only chaos.</p>

<p class="indent">‘Is that so?’ said Norman. ‘My. My.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Yes, and once things were ordered, God could see what was missing. My teacher didn’t actually say so, but that’s how God knew what to create next, I think.’</p>

<p class="indent">‘Well I never,’ said Norman. ‘Aren’t you a clever boy?’</p>

<p class="indent">&#160;</p>

<p class="noindent">Morris’s daughter is missing and he sits in his car outside his son’s house, daydreaming about long-dead teachers.</p>

<p class="indent">Order, thinks Morris. Something for the mind to hold on to. You are in your car. You have driven to David’s house. The radio is on. You have allowed yourself to be distracted.</p>

<p class="indent">&#160;</p>

<p class="noindent">He unbuckles his seatbelt, leaving the key turned so he can hear the radio till the last minute. The weather report comes on just as he’s about to remove the key. The car door is open. His body has shifted. He sits, neither inside nor out, uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="indent">The whole country washes over him.</p>
