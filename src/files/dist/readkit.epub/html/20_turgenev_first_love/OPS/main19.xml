<p>I should be in a great difficulty, if I were forced to describe
exactly what passed within me in the course of the week after my
unsuccessful midnight expedition. It was a strange feverish time, a
sort of chaos, in which the most violently opposed feelings,
thoughts, suspicions, hopes, joys, and sufferings, whirled together
in a kind of hurricane. I was afraid to look into myself, if a boy
of sixteen ever can look into himself; I was afraid to take stock
of anything; I simply hastened to live through every day till
evening; and at night I slept&#160;… the light-heartedness of
childhood came to my aid. I did not want to know whether I was
loved, and I did not want to acknowledge to myself that I was not
loved; my father I avoided – but Zinaïda I could not avoid… . I
burnt as in a fire in her presence&#160;… but what did I care to
know what the fire was in which I burned and melted – it was enough
that it was sweet to burn and melt. I gave myself up to all my
passing sensations, and cheated myself, turning away from memories,
and shutting my eyes to what I foreboded before me… . This weakness
would not most likely have lasted long in any case&#160;… a
thunderbolt cut it all short in a moment, and flung me into a new
track altogether.</p>
<p>Coming in one day to dinner from a rather long walk, I learnt
with amazement that I was to dine alone, that my father had gone
away and my mother was unwell, did not want any dinner, and had
shut herself up in her bedroom. From the faces of the footmen, I
surmised that something extraordinary had taken place… . I did not
dare to cross-examine them, but I had a friend in the young waiter
Philip, who was passionately fond of poetry, and a performer on the
guitar. I addressed myself to him. From him I learned that a
terrible scene had taken place between my father and mother (and
every word had been overheard in the maids’ room; much of it had
been in French, but Masha the lady’s-maid had lived five years’
with a dressmaker from Paris, and she understood it all); that my
mother had reproached my father with infidelity, with an intimacy
with the young lady next door, that my father at first had defended
himself, but afterwards had lost his temper, and he too had said
something cruel, ‘reflecting on her age’, which had made my mother
cry; that my mother too had alluded to some loan which it seemed
had been made to the old princess, and had spoken very ill of her
and of the young lady too, and that then my father had threatened
her. ‘And all the mischief,’ continued Philip, ‘came from an
anonymous letter; and who wrote it, no one knows, or else there’d
have been no reason whatever for the matter to have come out at
all.’</p>
<p>‘But was there really any ground,’ I brought out with
difficulty, while my hands and feet went cold, and a sort of
shudder ran through my inmost being.</p>
<p>Philip winked meaningly. ‘There was. There’s no hiding those
things; for all that your father was careful this time – but there,
you see, he’d, for instance, to hire a carriage or something&#160;…
no getting on without servants, either.’</p>
<p>I dismissed Philip, and fell on to my bed. I did not sob, I did
not give myself up to despair; I did not ask myself when and how
this had happened; I did not wonder how it was I had not guessed it
before, long ago; I did not even upbraid my father… . What I had
learnt was more than I could take in; this sudden revelation
stunned me… . All was at an end. All the fair blossoms of my heart
were roughly plucked at once, and lay about me, flung on the
ground, and trampled underfoot.</p>
