<p>I was so proud and light-hearted all that day, I so vividly
retained on my face the feeling of Zinaïda’s kisses, with such a
shudder of delight I recalled every word she had uttered, I so
hugged my unexpected happiness that I felt positively afraid,
positively unwilling to see her, who had given rise to these new
sensations. It seemed to me that now I could ask nothing more of
fate, that now I ought to ‘go, and draw a deep last sigh and die.’
But, next day, when I went into the lodge, I felt great
embarrassment, which I tried to conceal under a show of modest
confidence, befitting a man who wishes to make it apparent that he
knows how to keep a secret. Zinaïda received me very simply,
without any emotion, she simply shook her finger at me and asked
me, whether I wasn’t black and blue? All my modest confidence and
air of mystery vanished instantaneously and with them my
embarrassment. Of course, I had not expected anything particular,
but Zinaïda’s composure was like a bucket of cold water thrown over
me. I realised that in her eyes I was a child, and was extremely
miserable! Zinaïda walked up and down the room, giving me a quick
smile, whenever she caught my eye, but her thoughts were far away,
I saw that clearly… . ‘Shall I begin about what happened yesterday
myself,’ I pondered; ‘ask her, where she was hurrying off so fast,
so as to find out once for all’&#160;… but with a gesture of
despair, I merely went and sat down in a corner.</p>
<p>Byelovzorov came in; I felt relieved to see him.</p>
<p>‘I’ve not been able to find you a quiet horse,’ he said in a
sulky voice; ‘Freitag warrants one, but I don’t feel any confidence
in it, I am afraid.’</p>
<p>‘What are you afraid of?’ said Zinaïda; ‘allow me to
inquire?’</p>
<p>‘What am I afraid of? Why, you don’t know how to ride. Lord save
us, what might happen! What whim is this has come over you all of a
sudden?’</p>
<p>‘Come, that’s my business, Sir Wild Beast. In that case I will
ask Piotr Vassilievitch.’&#160;… (My father’s name was Piotr
Vassilievitch. I was surprised at her mentioning his name so
lightly and freely, as though she were confident of his readiness
to do her a service.)</p>
<p>‘Oh, indeed,’ retorted Byelovzorov, ‘you mean to go out riding
with him then?’</p>
<p>‘With him or with some one else is nothing to do with you. Only
not with you, anyway.’</p>
<p>‘Not with me,’ repeated Byelovzorov. ‘As you wish. Well, I shall
find you a horse.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, only mind now, don’t send some old cow. I warn you I want
to gallop.’</p>
<p>‘Gallop away by all means&#160;… with whom is it, with Malevsky,
you are going to ride?’</p>
<p>‘And why not with him, Mr. Pugnacity? Come, be quiet,’ she
added, ‘and don’t glare. I’ll take you too. You know that to my
mind now Malevsky’s – ugh!’ She shook her head.</p>
<p>‘You say that to console me,’ growled Byelovzorov.</p>
<p>Zinaïda half closed her eyes. ‘Does that console you? O&#160;…
O&#160;… O&#160;… Mr. Pugnacity!’ she said at last, as though she
could find no other word. ‘And you, M’sieu’ Voldemar, would you
come with us?’</p>
<p>‘I don’t care to&#160;… in a large party,’ I muttered, not
raising my eyes.</p>
<p>‘You prefer a tête-à-tête?… Well, freedom to the free, and
heaven to the saints,’ she commented with a sigh. ‘Go along,
Byelovzorov, and bestir yourself. I must have a horse for
to-morrow.’</p>
<p>‘Oh, and where’s the money to come from?’ put in the old
princess.</p>
<p>Zinaïda scowled.</p>
<p>‘I won’t ask you for it; Byelovzorov will trust me.’</p>
<p>‘He’ll trust you, will he?’&#160;… grumbled the old princess,
and all of a sudden she screeched at the top of her voice,
‘Duniashka!’</p>
<p>‘Maman, I have given you a bell to ring,’ observed Zinaïda.</p>
<p>‘Duniashka!’ repeated the old lady.</p>
<p>Byelovzorov took leave; I went away with him. Zinaïda did not
try to detain me.</p>
