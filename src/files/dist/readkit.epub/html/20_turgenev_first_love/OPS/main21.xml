<p>My father used every day to ride out on horse-back. He had a
splendid English mare, a chestnut piebald, with a long slender neck
and long legs, an inexhaustible and vicious beast. Her name was
Electric. No one could ride her except my father. One day he came
up to me in a good humour, a frame of mind in which I had not seen
him for a long while; he was getting ready for his ride, and had
already put on his spurs. I began entreating him to take me with
him.</p>
<p>‘We’d much better have a game of leap-frog,’ my father replied.
‘You’ll never keep up with me on your cob.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I will; I’ll put on spurs too.’</p>
<p>‘All right, come along then.’</p>
<p>We set off. I had a shaggy black horse, strong, and fairly
spirited. It is true it had to gallop its utmost, when Electric
went at full trot, still I was not left behind. I have never seen
any one ride like my father; he had such a fine carelessly easy
seat, that it seemed that the horse under him was conscious of it,
and proud of its rider. We rode through all the boulevards, reached
the ‘Maidens’ Field’, jumped several fences (at first I had been
afraid to take a leap, but my father had a contempt for cowards,
and I soon ceased to feel fear), twice crossed the river Moskva,
and I was under the impression that we were on our way home,
especially as my father of his own accord observed that my horse
was tired, when suddenly he turned off away from me at the Crimean
ford, and galloped along the river-bank. I rode after him. When he
had reached a high stack of old timber, he slid quickly off
Electric, told me to dismount, and giving me his horse’s bridle,
told me to wait for him there at the timber-stack, and, turning off
into a small street, disappeared. I began walking up and down the
river-bank, leading the horses, and scolding Electric, who kept
pulling, shaking her head, snorting and neighing as she went; and
when I stood still, never failed to paw the ground, and whining,
bite my cob on the neck; in fact she conducted herself altogether
like a spoilt thorough-bred. My father did not come back. A
disagreeable damp mist rose from the river; a fine rain began
softly blowing up, and spotting with tiny dark flecks the stupid
grey timber-stack, which I kept passing and repassing, and was
deadly sick of by now. I was terribly bored, and still my father
did not come. A sort of sentry-man, a Fin, grey all over like the
timber, and with a huge old-fashioned shako, like a pot, on his
head, and with a halberd (and how ever came a sentry, if you think
of it, on the banks of the Moskva!) drew near, and turning his
wrinkled face, like an old woman’s, towards me, he observed, ‘What
are you doing here with the horses, young master? Let me hold
them.’</p>
<p>I made him no reply. He asked me for tobacco. To get rid of him
(I was in a fret of impatience, too), I took a few steps in the
direction in which my father had disappeared, then walked along the
little street to the end, turned the corner, and stood still. In
the street, forty paces from me, at the open window of a little
wooden house, stood my father, his back turned to me; he was
leaning forward over the window-sill, and in the house, half hidden
by a curtain, sat a woman in a dark dress talking to my father;
this woman was Zinaïda.</p>
<p>I was petrified. This, I confess, I had never expected. My first
impulse was to run away. ‘My father will look round,’ I thought,
‘and I am lost&#160;… ’ but a strange feeling – a feeling stronger
than curiosity, stronger than jealousy, stronger even than fear –
held me there. I began to watch; I strained my ears to listen. It
seemed as though my father were insisting on something. Zinaïda
would not consent. I seem to see her face now – mournful, serious,
lovely, and with an inexpressible impress of devotion, grief, love,
and a sort of despair – I can find no other word for it. She
uttered monosyllables, not raising her eyes, simply smiling –
submissively, but without yielding. By that smile alone, I should
have known my Zinaïda of old days. My father shrugged his
shoulders, and straightened his hat on his head, which was always a
sign of impatience with him… . Then I caught the words: ‘<em>Vous
devez vous séparer de cette</em>… ’ Zinaïda sat up, and stretched
out her arm… . Suddenly, before my very eyes, the impossible
happened. My father suddenly lifted the whip, with which he had
been switching the dust off his coat, and I heard a sharp blow on
that arm, bare to the elbow. I could scarcely restrain myself from
crying out; while Zinaïda shuddered, looked without a word at my
father, and slowly raising her arm to her lips, kissed the streak
of red upon it. My father flung away the whip, and running quickly
up the steps, dashed into the house… . Zinaïda turned round, and
with outstretched arms and downcast head, she too moved away from
the window.</p>
<p>My heart sinking with panic, with a sort of awe-struck horror, I
rushed back, and running down the lane, almost letting go my hold
of Electric, went back to the bank of the river. I could not think
clearly of anything. I knew that my cold and reserved father was
sometimes seized by fits of fury; and all the same, I could never
comprehend what I had just seen… . But I felt at the time that,
however long I lived, I could never forget the gesture, the glance,
the smile, of Zinaïda; that her image, this image so suddenly
presented to me, was imprinted for ever on my memory. I stared
vacantly at the river, and never noticed that my tears were
streaming. ‘She is beaten,’ I was thinking,… ‘beaten&#160;… beaten…
.’</p>
<p>‘Hullo! what are you doing? Give me the mare!’ I heard my
father’s voice saying behind me.</p>
<p>Mechanically I gave him the bridle. He leaped on to
Electric&#160;… the mare, chill with standing, reared on her
haunches, and leaped ten feet away&#160;… but my father soon
subdued her; he drove the spurs into her sides, and gave her a blow
on the neck with his fist… . ‘Ah, I’ve no whip,’ he muttered.</p>
<p>I remembered the swish and fall of the whip, heard so short a
time before, and shuddered.</p>
<p>‘Where did you put it?’ I asked my father, after a brief
pause.</p>
<p>My father made no answer, and galloped on ahead. I overtook him.
I felt that I must see his face.</p>
<p>‘Were you bored waiting for me?’ he muttered through his
teeth.</p>
<p>‘A little. Where did you drop your whip?’ I asked again.</p>
<p>My father glanced quickly at me. ‘I didn’t drop it,’ he replied;
‘I threw it away.’ He sank into thought, and dropped his
head&#160;… and then, for the first, and almost for the last time,
I saw how much tenderness and pity his stern features were capable
of expressing.</p>
<p>He galloped on again, and this time I could not overtake him; I
got home a quarter-of-an-hour after him.</p>
<p>‘That’s love,’ I said to myself again, as I sat at night before
my writing-table, on which books and papers had begun to make their
appearance; ‘that’s passion!… To think of not revolting, of bearing
a blow from any one whatever&#160;… even the dearest hand! But it
seems one can, if one loves… . While I&#160;… I imagined&#160;…
’</p>
<p>I had grown much older during the last month; and my love, with
all its transports and sufferings, struck me myself as something
small and childish and pitiful beside this other unimagined
something, which I could hardly fully grasp, and which frightened
me like an unknown, beautiful, but menacing face, which one strives
in vain to make out clearly in the half-darkness… .</p>
<p>A strange and fearful dream came to me that same night. I
dreamed I went into a low dark room… . My father was standing with
a whip in his hand, stamping with anger; in the corner crouched
Zinaïda, and not on her arm, but on her forehead, was a stripe of
red&#160;… while behind them both towered Byelovzorov, covered with
blood; he opened his white lips, and wrathfully threatened my
father.</p>
<p>Two months later, I entered the university; and within six
months my father died of a stroke in Petersburg, where he had just
moved with my mother and me. A few days before his death he
received a letter from Moscow which threw him into a violent
agitation… . He went to my mother to beg some favour of her: and, I
was told, he positively shed tears – he, my father! On the very
morning of the day when he was stricken down, he had begun a letter
to me in French. ‘<em>My son</em>,’ he wrote to me, ‘<em>fear the
love of woman; fear that bliss, that poison… .</em>’ After his
death, my mother sent a considerable sum of money to Moscow.</p>
